Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson are the two most important liberal journalists working in the legacy press today—Ezra at The New York Times, and Derek at The Atlantic.

Although they insist they’ll never go into politics themselves, they are offering Democrats a path back to power.

To see their way out of the political wilderness, the Democrats need a vision—one that goes beyond resistance to Trump. A vision that can bring back the disaffected Democrats who stayed home, or voted red for the first time, this past November.

While other liberals and progressives are doubling down on zombie ideas, afraid to come face to face with a country that has moved decisively to the right, Ezra and Derek are willing to face reality. They see that blue states are functioning—as Bari likes to say—similarly to the DMV. And as a result, people are fleeing to places like Texas and Florida.

If you’ve lived in a city like L.A. or San Francisco in the past decade, it’s pretty difficult to sell the idea that the government is working effectively. It’s why so many people are cheering for DOGE.

But while DOGE is taking a chain saw to the federal bureaucracy, Ezra and Derek are reformers who believe it can be fixed. They want to rein in the laws, regulations, and liberal thinking that have made it nearly impossible to do anything in this country.

They just wrote a new book about all of this called Abundance. Their thesis is simple: To have the future we want, we need to build and invent more of what we need. 

While conservatives and libertarians might say: Yes, exactly, let the free market do its thing, Ezra and Derek think the government can play a crucial role—if liberals will let it.

So how do we build a government that’s less like the DMV and more like the Apple Store? How will this government actually deliver for Americans and solve our most pressing problems—in housing, energy, transportation, and healthcare? And, how do we reverse our government’s long march into total incompetence?

Ezra and Derek have a lot of ideas on how we can get there. Today on Honestly, we hear them. This conversation challenged us, and we hope it challenges and surprises you too.

# Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson Have a Plan for the Left
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk)
*  From the Free Press, this is Honestly and I'm Barry Weiss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=0.0s)]
*  For my money, Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson are the two most important liberal journalists [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4.88s)]
*  working in the legacy press today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=10.28s)]
*  Ezra, of course, at the New York Times and Derek, a staff writer at the Atlantic. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=12.44s)]
*  Although they insist they'll never go into politics themselves, they are offering Democrats [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=18.1s)]
*  a path back to power. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=22.64s)]
*  To see their way out of the political wilderness, Democrats need a vision, one that goes beyond [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=25.3s)]
*  resistance to Trump, a vision that can bring back the disaffected Democrats who either [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=31.18s)]
*  stayed home or voted red for the first time this past November. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=36.54s)]
*  But while a lot of other progressives are doubling down on zombie ideas or frankly zombie [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  politicians, afraid to come face to face with a country that has moved decisively to the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=46.5s)]
*  right, Ezra and Derek are willing to face reality. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=50.94s)]
*  They see that blue states, especially blue cities, are functioning, and this is my language, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=54.86s)]
*  not theirs, similar to the DMV. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=60.18s)]
*  If you've lived in a city like Los Angeles or San Francisco in the past decade, it's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=62.74s)]
*  pretty difficult to sell the idea that government is working effectively. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  Perhaps that's why so many people, liberals and conservatives, are cheering on Doge. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=71.58s)]
*  But while Doge is taking a chainsaw to the federal bureaucracy, Ezra and Derek aren't [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=77.12s)]
*  so much radicals as reformers who believe it can be fixed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  They want to rein in the laws and the regulations and also just the worldview that has made [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=86.16s)]
*  it all but impossible to do anything in this country in government. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  They just wrote a new book all about this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=96.68s)]
*  It's called Abundance, and the thesis is very simple. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=99.04s)]
*  As they write, to have the future we want, we need to build and invent more of what we need. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=102.48s)]
*  And conservatives and libertarians will hear that and say, yes, exactly, we agree, let [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=108.12s)]
*  the free market do its thing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  But Ezra and Derek say not so fast. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=115.28s)]
*  The government must play a crucial role, and it can if only liberals would let it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=117.56s)]
*  So how do we build a government that's less like the DMV and more like the Apple Store? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  How will this government actually deliver for Americans and solve our most pressing [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=128.1s)]
*  problems in housing, energy, transportation and healthcare? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=132.68s)]
*  And how do we reverse, if we can, our government's long march into total incompetence? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=137.62s)]
*  Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson have a lot of ideas on how we can get there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  Today on Honestly, we hear them out. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=147.82000000000002s)]
*  This conversation was fun, it was provocative, it challenged me, and I suspect you'll feel [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=150.26000000000002s)]
*  the same way. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=154.9s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=156.38000000000002s)]
*  Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, welcome to Honestly. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=163.3s)]
*  Thank you for having us. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=165.5s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=166.72000000000003s)]
*  It's so nice to have you here. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=167.22s)]
*  Okay, so you begin this new book of yours, Abundance, with kind of a vision, a utopian [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=168.5s)]
*  vision some might say, you might say it's realistic, of 2050. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=173.98s)]
*  There's fresh, abundant water, there's incredible food, there's meat, as far as the eye can [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=177.78s)]
*  see, but it's been created in petri dishes, there's no more factory farming. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=183.66s)]
*  Scaffolds. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=186.98s)]
*  It's scaffolding. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=187.98s)]
*  Fine, okay, fine. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=188.98s)]
*  There's AI, but the AI has not put us out of work, the AI has just made our lives better. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=189.98s)]
*  You talk about a family going on a weekend trip, a two-hour jet taking them from New [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=195.86s)]
*  York to London. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=199.66000000000003s)]
*  It's an incredible vision. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=201.24s)]
*  I was reading those pages just outside of here in a public park in New York City, and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=203.22000000000003s)]
*  I was like, wow, this is amazing fantasy. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=208.62s)]
*  I look up and it's like within spitting distance of me, there's two homeless guys, one sort [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=211.94000000000003s)]
*  of half-naked, there's litter everywhere. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=217.5s)]
*  Granted, I used to live in LA, New York is 100 times better than that, and it's still [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=220.66000000000003s)]
*  a world away from this vision that you're laying out. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=225.98s)]
*  I just want to start by having you guys lay out the elevator pitch of this book. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=228.5s)]
*  What is the abundance agenda, and what is the gap between our, I guess, lived experience, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=234.54s)]
*  you could say, and the vision that you're laying out as something that isn't utopian, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  but is within reach if we change our policies in the right way? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=245.57999999999998s)]
*  The abundance agenda, just very simply put, is it to have the future we want. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  We need to build and invent more of what we need. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=253.26s)]
*  That's really it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  As you say on the first page, it seems like a little too simple to write a book about [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=256.58s)]
*  this because who doesn't want more good things? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=260.58s)]
*  Then you live in California, as both of us did, and you see actually a bunch of people [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=263.09999999999997s)]
*  have stopped us from building the things we need. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=268.7s)]
*  Housing, clean energy, high-speed rail, and this story can replicate itself across the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=271.74s)]
*  country, across frankly the world. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=277.58s)]
*  One of the things we're trying to do in the book is refocus where sort of like liberals [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=280.26s)]
*  in the American tradition, refocus liberalism on problems of supply. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=283.78s)]
*  Where do we not have enough of what we need, and what has stood in the way of us creating [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=288.02s)]
*  abundance there? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=292.21999999999997s)]
*  Then there's the vignette you're talking about, which is also putting technology more at the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=293.62s)]
*  core of questions of what kind of future we want. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=298.06s)]
*  A huge amount of creating a more wonderful future is about what technologies are inserted [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=301.5s)]
*  into it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=308.18s)]
*  I've been in a lot of my career and still arguing for covering the fight to create universal [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=309.18s)]
*  health care. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=314.02s)]
*  But that insurance, whether you get it through Medicare and Medicaid or Bernie Sanders' Medicare [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  for All plan or a private health insurer, that insurance's value to you is based upon [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=320.26s)]
*  the pharmaceuticals, the medical devices, the surgical techniques that are available. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=326.7s)]
*  The value of Medicare for All is different in a world with GLP-1s than in a world without [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=331.42s)]
*  them. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  If we develop cures for autoimmune diseases right now that baffle doctors, then if we [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=337.97999999999996s)]
*  don't, I think we think that the relationship, the politics around technology have become [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=342.34s)]
*  highly dysfunctional over the past, I mean, maybe more than a decade, but I'm thinking [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=349.14s)]
*  about a decade. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=352.9s)]
*  And, you know, I think that particularly on the left where there's a big disillusionment [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=353.9s)]
*  and I think the post social media era, not wrongly, I think social media's been pretty [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=357.62s)]
*  bad in a bunch of ways. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=361.62s)]
*  In general, I would say the left is the side, let's call it that, that's much more critical [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  of technology, much more skeptical that it could bring progress. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=369.78000000000003s)]
*  And you're trying to say no? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=373.26s)]
*  And it wasn't always that way. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=374.78000000000003s)]
*  Marx was a very technological thinker. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=377.06s)]
*  We are somewhat, yeah, how many people come here and make a good argument with Marxism? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=379.14s)]
*  Is that normal on? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=382.62s)]
*  Actually, someone was just, no, I was just talking to Alex Karp, actually, who you would [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=383.62s)]
*  not imagine would be, we were in a very long back and forth about Marx and the Frankfurt [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=386.58s)]
*  School because he ended up getting a PhD in German. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=391.82s)]
*  Anyway, don't ask. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=393.82s)]
*  But you would not imagine the CEO of Palantir would be talking about Marx, but he was. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=394.82s)]
*  So you're not the first. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=397.94s)]
*  So there's some of that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=398.94s)]
*  We're somewhat inspired by this leftist track from a couple of years ago, which has the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=400.14s)]
*  best name of any book published in the past couple of decades, Fully Automated Luxury [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=403.26s)]
*  Communism. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=406.53999999999996s)]
*  There is no such thing as luxury communism, but yes. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=407.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, but who knows if it was all fully automated. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=410.38s)]
*  We're not communists yet, but there is a- [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=413.26s)]
*  Wait, wait, hold on. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=416.85999999999996s)]
*  What do you mean, yet? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=417.85999999999996s)]
*  I'm unveiling something right here on Honestly. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=419.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=422.34000000000003s)]
*  There is something about developing, I think, a felt sense that there are just problems [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=423.34000000000003s)]
*  we cannot solve and possibilities we cannot create unless we pull technology forward. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=430.18s)]
*  And that technology can be embedded, it needs to be embedded in sort of just and humane [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=433.94s)]
*  policies and institutions. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=438.54s)]
*  Technology can be an accelerator of wanton inequality as easily as it can be something [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=440.26s)]
*  that diminishes wanton inequality. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=444.66s)]
*  But if you don't think about it, if you don't try to ask yourself, what do we need? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=447.06s)]
*  Well, then you can't solve those problems. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=450.7s)]
*  A good example on the left is that there's no decarbonization path that does not include [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=452.38s)]
*  technologically figuring out a way to make green cement. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=457.38s)]
*  Cement on its own would be the third largest emitter measured by countries in the world. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=461.38s)]
*  We currently cannot at scale affordably make cement in a way that is not really huge amounts [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=466.06s)]
*  of greenhouse gas. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=470.16s)]
*  If we don't figure that out, there's no path forward here. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=471.16s)]
*  So trying to sort of rebuild a sense that people, that liberals need to have not just [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=473.94s)]
*  five social insurance programs they would like to expand, but five technologies they [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=478.34s)]
*  would like to pull forward and sort of orient resources to make happen. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=481.86s)]
*  That's the other side of the project. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=486.1s)]
*  You know, I want to go back to the jump scare moment. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=488.5s)]
*  Let's talk about labs. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=490.5s)]
*  You really felt. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=491.5s)]
*  Because that jump scare that you felt. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=492.5s)]
*  Wait, what's the jump scare? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=494.74s)]
*  When I said marks? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=495.86s)]
*  Or when I said? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=496.86s)]
*  The jump scare moment. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=497.86s)]
*  Yeah, again, no, no. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=498.86s)]
*  I want to go back to the first of the seven jump scares that you've experienced. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=499.86s)]
*  The jump scare that you felt when you read the introduction to our book and then looked [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=504.21999999999997s)]
*  up into New York City. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=508.7s)]
*  I mean, that's the jump scare that we're trying to get people to feel is to provide a vision [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=510.53999999999996s)]
*  of, yes, utopian, but also I think actually somewhat realistic vision of what we could [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=515.0s)]
*  have in the 2050s. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=520.34s)]
*  If we developed housing abundance and energy abundance and accelerated scientific discovery, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=521.98s)]
*  it's not crazy to think that we could have what we call star pills, which is to say GLP-1 [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=526.86s)]
*  drugs and other life extending drugs developed in low orbit that are sent to us not by people, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=531.5799999999999s)]
*  but by drones that drop off the pills in our front yards. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=536.9399999999999s)]
*  These technologies, I think, are at the cusp of existing. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=540.66s)]
*  We can pull them forward. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=543.54s)]
*  Why in low orbit? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=544.78s)]
*  In low orbit because they have to be built in low gravity conditions. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=546.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=548.66s)]
*  But I think it's really important to say that the problem we have, and especially a problem [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=549.66s)]
*  that we have in democratically run places, because you said you came from California [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=555.8199999999999s)]
*  and then you came to New York, is that it's not just that we can't invent things that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=558.88s)]
*  we don't have yet. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=563.36s)]
*  We also can't build what we understand. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=564.6s)]
*  The apartment building is a very ancient technology. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=566.62s)]
*  Elijah Otis came up with the elevator about 170 years ago, but somehow we can't build [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=569.04s)]
*  apartment buildings in San Francisco and Los Angeles and many democratic run cities. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=573.84s)]
*  Energy is, for the most part, especially clean energy, a very ancient technology. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=577.96s)]
*  Solar energy is 70 years old. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=581.6s)]
*  Wind turbines are 130 years old. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=583.4s)]
*  We know how to do geothermal, but we're not actually building it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=585.2s)]
*  In many cases, it's liberal areas that are the worst offenders when it comes to permitting [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=588.28s)]
*  and blocking and making it impossible to actually manifest a clean energy abundant world. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=593.1999999999999s)]
*  One thing this book really tries to do is take seriously the idea that Ezra and I, we're [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=600.68s)]
*  from the liberal tradition, maybe not all the way the Marxist tradition. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=605.0s)]
*  Look at the communist tradition. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=607.92s)]
*  I'll let Ezra speak for himself. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=608.92s)]
*  We're American liberals. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=610.9599999999999s)]
*  We look back at what was accomplished during the New Deal and we consider that to be an [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=612.64s)]
*  enormous success, enormous expression of American potential. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=615.64s)]
*  But something very serious and important has happened to the character and the identity [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=619.72s)]
*  of liberalism in the last 50 years. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=624.24s)]
*  And to just gloss it very quickly, because I hope you return to it over and over again, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=626.48s)]
*  I think we went from a world where liberalism was a liberalism of building between the 1930s [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=630.0400000000001s)]
*  and 1960s. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=634.64s)]
*  And then there was a turn in the 1960s and 1970s. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=635.88s)]
*  And for the last half century, liberalism has too often meant at the local and state [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=638.52s)]
*  level a liberalism of blocking. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=642.4s)]
*  Liberalism is expressed by, oh, you can't build that there because of environmental [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  rules. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=648.88s)]
*  You can't build that there because it could possibly upset some local homeowners. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=649.88s)]
*  And in fact, it does seem like, according to studies, as the progressive share of a [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=653.52s)]
*  city population increases, the number of housing permits decrease, because for some reason, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=658.64s)]
*  it does seem to be liberals who are more litigious when it comes to blocking construction. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=663.12s)]
*  So to end where I started, the jump scare that we want people to feel, and we do want [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=667.8s)]
*  to literally, viscerally feel it, is the difference between a world that absolutely is possible [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=672.1999999999999s)]
*  if we get out of our way and get back into the habit of building and the world that exists, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=677.12s)]
*  which is a world where even in places that are run exclusively by Democrats, whether [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=682.4399999999999s)]
*  it's in New York or California, it is often our own side whose obsession with process [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=686.24s)]
*  is getting in the way of outcomes. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=693.0s)]
*  I'm having like echoes of two other conversations that I've had on this show. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=694.88s)]
*  One with Peter Thiel, he's been on twice, but of course he was most famous, or Founders [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=699.6s)]
*  Fund, I think their motto, probably call it that, was this idea that we were promised [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=703.52s)]
*  flying cars and all we got were 140 characters. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  In other words, we were promised this sort of utopian, incredible, technologically progressive [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=709.88s)]
*  future that actually we settled for little apps that kept us glued to our phone. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=715.8000000000001s)]
*  And the other is Marc Andreessen, who has written this kind of manifesto of his venture [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=719.44s)]
*  fund, talking about how it's a time to build. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=725.6s)]
*  You guys sound like you're echoing the arguments of people whose politics, libertarian, center [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=728.56s)]
*  right, you really disagree with. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=735.52s)]
*  So help square that for me. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=737.64s)]
*  No one is wrong about everything. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=739.8399999999999s)]
*  Because I'm nice. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=740.8399999999999s)]
*  But a lot of the arguments that you're making now and that you make in the book feel to [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=741.8399999999999s)]
*  me in frankly a very satisfying way, like a lot of the arguments that my wife has been [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=746.9599999999999s)]
*  making to me over the dinner table for the past 10 years, yimbyism, building, getting [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=752.0s)]
*  rid of government regulation, things that we don't necessarily, at least in this moment, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=757.78s)]
*  associate with the progressive politics that both of you, but especially you, Ezra, typically [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=763.38s)]
*  espouse. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=767.42s)]
*  So square that for people. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=768.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=769.9s)]
*  So let me make a couple of cuts here and try to distinguish some of it at least, because [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=770.9s)]
*  there are places where I do agree with Peter Thiel. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=775.54s)]
*  I listened to that interview you did with him. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=777.42s)]
*  I thought it was really interesting. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=778.94s)]
*  I listened to him on Joe Rogan right around that same time saying that California has [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=779.94s)]
*  become like Saudi Arabia and it's like always going to sort of drift on this innovative [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=783.7s)]
*  structure it has, but it can't do anything new. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=789.5s)]
*  One thing where I probably differ with them is that people talk about deregulation. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=794.22s)]
*  I think you just did a second ago. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=799.1400000000001s)]
*  And what comes to their mind immediately is deregulating the market. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=800.7800000000001s)]
*  And there are places where I think we believe that needs to happen. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=804.94s)]
*  So home building is a very good example. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=808.1s)]
*  One of the things we're quite focused on is deregulating government itself. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=811.64s)]
*  So government has more capacity to act and act with a certain strength and capability. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=814.72s)]
*  High-speed rail or for that matter, public housing are both good examples of this where [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=820.48s)]
*  we have made it, I mean, liberals have made it from one direction. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=824.28s)]
*  Sort of liberals have hobbled government and conservatives have tried to assault it, but [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=827.92s)]
*  we're a little bit more worried about the liberal case here because we're thinking about [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=832.0s)]
*  government in blue states. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=834.88s)]
*  And so there are places where you would want government to be able to act with more agency, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=836.8s)]
*  more autonomy, not be quite so vulnerable to endless lawsuits. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=842.7199999999999s)]
*  I did a lot of reporting on high-speed rail for this book. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=846.56s)]
*  And high-speed rail is first a very pro-environmental project from the get-go. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=849.1999999999999s)]
*  You are moving people out of cars and into high-speed rail. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=854.5999999999999s)]
*  The environmental clearances on that project began in 2012. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=858.3599999999999s)]
*  By the end of 2024, when we were doing final fact-checking, they were almost, but not yet, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=862.94s)]
*  quite done. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=867.4200000000001s)]
*  So there are just problems in how government itself is run. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=868.7s)]
*  People who are on my left often will come at us from a different perspective. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=872.6400000000001s)]
*  We don't need more developer-built housing. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=876.22s)]
*  We need more public housing. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=878.3800000000001s)]
*  That's fine if you want to build public housing. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=879.3800000000001s)]
*  But right now, under the rules that trigger, when you try to use public money to build [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=881.58s)]
*  affordable housing, which is another thing we focus on in the book, you end up forcing [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=885.46s)]
*  the government to build in a way that is much more cumbersome, much slower, much less affordable, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=889.24s)]
*  and much more likely to make sure that the project never happens at all than when you [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=894.36s)]
*  build with private money. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=898.44s)]
*  We spent some time talking about a development in San Francisco called Tehanan, which was [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=899.72s)]
*  built in about half the time, at about half the cost, than the normal affordable housing [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=904.76s)]
*  you see there. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=909.9200000000001s)]
*  But the secret sauce was that Charles and Helen Schwab gave $50 or $60 million to circumvent [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=910.9200000000001s)]
*  all public money. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=916.32s)]
*  And because it never touched public money, it didn't trigger this cascade of rules and [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=917.36s)]
*  regulations. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=921.16s)]
*  A lot of these rules and regulations might be well-meaning, but they make it so liberal [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=922.16s)]
*  government cannot do what it is attempting to do. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=926.28s)]
*  The difference where I probably have with Peter Thiel or Marc Andreessen is in aims [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=928.84s)]
*  and goals. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=933.1s)]
*  There's versions of abundance or supply-side work on the right, but for instance, I don't [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=934.1s)]
*  want to unleash an orgy of fossil fuel construction. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=940.12s)]
*  I want to make clean energy easier to build. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=943.4s)]
*  Maybe we both want to make affordable housing easier to build, and if so, I would love to [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=945.8399999999999s)]
*  partner up. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=948.7199999999999s)]
*  But the aims and the goals are meaningful here. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=949.8s)]
*  The right has its own pathologies, its own problems. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=952.68s)]
*  I don't think what DOJ is doing is making the government more efficient, more capable. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=955.12s)]
*  I think it is trying to light state capacity on fire. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=958.4799999999999s)]
*  They want to, I'm not saying for Thiel or Andreessen here, but often I think we're caught [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=961.8399999999999s)]
*  between a right that wants to destroy government and a left that won't make government work. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=966.56s)]
*  And so for those of us who actually want to see a capable government, there's almost no [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=971.9599999999999s)]
*  home. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=975.24s)]
*  I think that much of what Peter Thiel says is quite brilliant. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=977.84s)]
*  And there's many ways that I agree with him. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=983.08s)]
*  And there's no way that I agree with him more strongly than this idea that something happened [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=984.76s)]
*  to the character of American innovation in the 1960s and 1970s. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=989.04s)]
*  In the first half of the 20th century, invention was a physical world phenomenon. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=993.24s)]
*  We built nuclear power plants. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=999.14s)]
*  We built airplanes. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1001.64s)]
*  We built cars. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1003.32s)]
*  We changed the physical environment of our cities. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1004.84s)]
*  We could actually build trains, not just allocate $33 billion toward building them and then [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1007.48s)]
*  never actually build them. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1012.96s)]
*  We built Amtrak. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1014.4s)]
*  Something happened in the 1960s and 1970s where I think that Thiel has a very interesting [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1015.4s)]
*  diagnosis where he says, we regulated the physical world so much that we funneled innovation [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1020.12s)]
*  into the digital world. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1025.6000000000001s)]
*  I think that's a very compelling story. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1027.04s)]
*  And it goes toward explaining why the world, the physical world invention that we imagined [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1029.72s)]
*  with the jet packs and the space travel, all of that stuff you have to build with atoms, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1035.68s)]
*  but in a world where that stuff is hyper-regulated, well, the only innovation that is quote unquote [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1041.0s)]
*  legal from a certain perspective exists in the digital realm of bits. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1045.3600000000001s)]
*  And that's why we have artificial intelligence that is massively brilliant and gaining brilliance [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1049.76s)]
*  by the month, while at the same time, we still can't build a train at the same speed that [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1055.26s)]
*  we did 50 or even 100 years ago. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1061.34s)]
*  This physical world slowdown paired with this digital world acceleration is a really astute [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1064.16s)]
*  observation. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1069.58s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I'm with Ezra, the difference between us and Peter Thiel [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1071.5s)]
*  is fundamentally that we're liberals and he's a libertarian. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1076.12s)]
*  We're not just liberals in an American tradition. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1079.62s)]
*  We like to build things. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1081.7s)]
*  I'm a tax and spend liberal. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1083.6999999999998s)]
*  I believe in high taxes on the wealthy because I believe in income redistribution because [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1085.22s)]
*  poverty I think is a moral sin. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1089.6999999999998s)]
*  I believe in Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1091.82s)]
*  I believe in public education. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1094.5s)]
*  I believe in a well-financed state that accomplishes public ends. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1096.02s)]
*  But an issue with liberalism, I think in the last few decades and even in the last few [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1101.46s)]
*  years is that it's begun to associate success by how much money you can spend and not how [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1104.78s)]
*  much you can actually build. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1112.46s)]
*  That's how you get a world where people are proud of $33 billion allocated to a high speed [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1114.34s)]
*  rail system that isn't built. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1117.94s)]
*  It's a world where maybe you saw on Twitter. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1119.54s)]
*  We're not proud of it. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1120.54s)]
*  Or not proud of it. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1121.54s)]
*  Californians aren't proud of that one. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1122.54s)]
*  Sorry, you were proud of the announcement. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1123.54s)]
*  You're obviously not proud of the outcome. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1125.58s)]
*  You just saw maybe last week, it was taken down, the Chicago mayor bragged about spending [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1128.1s)]
*  $11 billion on 10,000 affordable housing units in the city of Chicago. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1132.22s)]
*  Very quick arithmetic. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1137.18s)]
*  $11.5 billion spent on housing. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1138.18s)]
*  That's $1.1 million spent per affordable heavy quotation marks unit. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1139.18s)]
*  This is pathetic. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1144.1000000000001s)]
*  And so what we're trying to do is make government more efficient at achieving liberal ends. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1145.8600000000001s)]
*  Housing abundance is a liberal end. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1152.7s)]
*  Building clean energy so that we can live modern lives without coughing up carbon dioxide [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1154.66s)]
*  into the atmosphere and choking the planet is, I think at the moment, politically speaking, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1159.46s)]
*  a definitionally progressive end. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1163.66s)]
*  Our goals are progressive, but we see reality, I think, the same way that some of the technologists [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1166.22s)]
*  see reality. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1171.96s)]
*  Something's happened to physical world innovation. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1173.26s)]
*  And they recognize it as much as government has. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1176.3s)]
*  Something's happened to the way that we innovate and build in the physical world. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1178.94s)]
*  And it's funneled all of these energies and this talent and its treasure to the digital [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1182.14s)]
*  realm. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1186.9s)]
*  And I'd love to unwind that. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1187.9s)]
*  I would love the next generation to be as physical in its innovation as the previous [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1189.02s)]
*  generation was digital. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1193.24s)]
*  A lot of people who listen to this show, and frankly, a lot of the people that work in [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1194.58s)]
*  the newsroom here, will hear you say, you know, I'm a tax and spend liberal. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1197.94s)]
*  And they'll say, I used to be that too. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1202.86s)]
*  And I saw the reality of it. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1205.34s)]
*  And in many ways, I think the story, I don't want to say of the free press, but of many [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1207.94s)]
*  of our readers is the story of the disillusioned liberal who came up against, whether it was [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1212.6s)]
*  in LA or San Francisco or New York or a lot of the places that went right. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1217.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't want to say gave Donald Trump the election, but moved right decisively in the [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1222.94s)]
*  last election or found themselves moving to cities that they didn't really want to live [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1226.8600000000001s)]
*  in as much. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1231.3s)]
*  Austin, Miami, they're making a good life for themselves. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1232.3s)]
*  And they're basically like, it's not worth it. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1235.94s)]
*  The crime is not worth it. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1237.9s)]
*  The homelessness is not worth it. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1238.9s)]
*  The fact that I feel like government is lighting my money on fire pisses me off. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1240.4s)]
*  You know, what do you say to the person who has had that experience and says, this all [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1245.74s)]
*  sounds great, guys, but we've lived that reality. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1250.42s)]
*  We see that the states that are spending the most that have the biggest government that [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1253.5800000000002s)]
*  have the highest taxes are delivering the worst outcomes for people. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1258.42s)]

*  Convince me that I should be one. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1264.66s)]
*  Well, I think first, Donald Trump is going to convince a lot of people to give liberalism [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1265.66s)]
*  a second look. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1268.74s)]

*  One of the things that I'm hearing in your questions, it totally makes sense is also [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1273.0600000000002s)]
*  a braiding of two things, which is disorder. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1280.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1282.94s)]
*  There are a bunch of problems even noted disorder. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1283.94s)]
*  I was thinking when you were you were talking about the vignette and reading the sci fi [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1285.7s)]
*  future and seeing, you know, an unclothed homeless person that I mean, we never say [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1288.66s)]
*  that it's impossible that while we have star pills, you can't have unclothed homeless [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1293.78s)]
*  people on the street, but hopefully we'll do a better job on this. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1297.42s)]
*  Very much. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1300.42s)]
*  If I'm living in a world with star pills and a jet that gets me to London in two hours, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1301.42s)]
*  I'm assuming that there's not actually right. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1305.78s)]
*  Because there's always going to be schizophrenia. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1309.58s)]
*  No, that's not what I mean. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1310.58s)]
*  It's that these are California is a richer, lower poverty, lower levels of drug addiction [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1312.02s)]
*  state than West Virginia with a much higher level of homelessness. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1321.5s)]
*  You can have an incredibly technologically advanced society. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1324.6999999999998s)]
*  I mean, California is the frontier of technology. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1327.22s)]
*  Most of the great AI companies, the frontier AI labs that are not in China are happening [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1329.54s)]
*  within 50 miles of each other in the Bay Area. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1334.86s)]
*  And it is not built enough housing and it has developed a sort of tolerance of disorder [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1337.54s)]
*  that has given it this sort of insane dual character. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1342.1399999999999s)]
*  But the disorder is the split screen that all of us live there. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1344.74s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1348.3s)]
*  So that is the reason. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1349.3s)]
*  We call the police, they don't show up for an hour and a half. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1350.3s)]
*  That's the reason I'm pulling these two things apart, because there are certain problems [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1352.82s)]
*  that are supply problems that we are trying to solve. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1356.78s)]
*  I also agree that disorder has become a fundamental problem that liberal jurisdictions, at least [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1359.6599999999999s)]
*  until recently, just sort of began to tolerate or tell themselves it was part of progressivism [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1367.52s)]
*  to tolerate. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1372.04s)]
*  I think that was a terrible mistake. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1373.04s)]
*  Before the election, I had Charles Feyn-Lehmann on my show and I thought he got at something [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1374.04s)]
*  that liberals were really sort of using crime data to ignore. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1378.48s)]
*  Pre-press contributor. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1382.48s)]
*  There you go. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1383.48s)]
*  Which is that you had just had a huge rise in disorder that wasn't even always there [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1384.58s)]
*  in the crime statistics. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1389.06s)]
*  Sometimes these things are braided, right? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1390.6399999999999s)]
*  The homelessness disorder is directly related to the lack of supply of housing. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1391.8s)]
*  Sometimes you actually just need to have different policies. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1396.62s)]
*  One of the things happening right now is that the right came in promising order and has [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1399.9399999999998s)]
*  created a whole new form of disorder. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1405.3799999999999s)]
*  What Doge is doing disorderly. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1407.56s)]
*  What Trump is doing with tariffs has created tremendous amounts of economic disorder. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1409.62s)]
*  There is a version, I think, of the right, the free press right, I think the right that [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1414.98s)]
*  you would have liked to see, that came in really with a pinpoint eye, saw the weaknesses [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1418.62s)]
*  of liberal governance and went right at them. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1424.5s)]
*  Went at the cost of living, went at disorder, went at the feeling that nobody was in control, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1426.82s)]
*  that people weren't taking problems seriously. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1431.86s)]
*  If there's any cultural problem in liberalism that I think we're aimed at correcting, it's [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1433.26s)]
*  the tendency to see something wrong and excuse it away, as opposed to seeing something wrong [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1439.66s)]
*  and work backwards on how to fix it. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1443.62s)]
*  Trump could have come in and could have been right wing abundance and right wing government. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1446.22s)]
*  The Department of Government Efficiency, I would love an actual Department of Government [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1451.86s)]
*  Efficiency. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1455.58s)]
*  The fact that Biden didn't do it, right? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1456.58s)]
*  Democrats used to think about this. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1458.1799999999998s)]
*  Clinton had reinvented government, which Al Gore was in charge of. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1459.1799999999998s)]
*  There's a version of that. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1462.06s)]
*  Ro Khanna wanted to be part of it. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1463.06s)]
*  There is a version of that they really could have done that wasn't just a hack, slash and [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1464.78s)]
*  grab project. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1469.2199999999998s)]
*  There's a version of coming and bringing the Texas housing policies to the nation and saying, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1472.3799999999999s)]
*  as Brian Deese, a former NEC director for Biden just did in a Foreign Affairs article, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1476.34s)]
*  there's no jurisdiction that has very strict zoning laws. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1480.94s)]
*  It makes it impossible to create housing supplies, getting any more federal money through the [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1485.26s)]
*  Transportation Department, right? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1488.0600000000002s)]
*  They could have done that in the Trump administration. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1489.94s)]
*  They're not doing any of it. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1491.14s)]
*  So what they've done is create a lot of disorder. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1492.98s)]
*  And I think they're going to create a lot of scarcity between the tariffs, between the [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1495.92s)]
*  immigration policies and between what they're trying to do to government capacity that creates [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1499.18s)]
*  a possibility for something new to arise in response. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1504.9s)]
*  I'm not going to tell the people who are pissed off about how California was governed or how [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1509.42s)]
*  New York is governed that they're wrong. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1513.38s)]
*  They're not wrong. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1516.14s)]
*  What I am going to try to do is fix the way or try to persuade people that we need something [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1518.14s)]
*  new. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1523.9s)]
*  And a lot of people, one thing I will say about liberals in their defense is they're [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1524.9s)]
*  willing to be self-critical. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1529.26s)]
*  So you have a lot, I mean, Richie Torres, I think is probably going to run against Kathy [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1531.5800000000002s)]
*  Hochul for governor. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1534.38s)]
*  And he's out there arguing for abundance. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1536.0600000000002s)]
*  And Jared Polis, who I think has been a very effective governor in Colorado, right, he [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1538.38s)]
*  says he has a cost of living and abundance focused agenda. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1541.6200000000001s)]
*  This is a fact, there are factional fights on both sides. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1544.8600000000001s)]
*  This is a factional fight, you know, in on the sort of more liberal side. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1547.3000000000002s)]
*  And hopefully it will create models of governance that people want. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1551.2600000000002s)]
*  But it's something we say a lot. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1554.6000000000001s)]
*  But both of the people you just mentioned, I think notably are like blue dog, what we [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1556.14s)]
*  would have called Scoop Jackson Democrats, blue dog Democrats. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1560.9s)]
*  They are not progressives. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1563.24s)]
*  Like Jared Polis and Richie Torres are... [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1565.7800000000002s)]
*  I would call Jared Polis, I mean, I don't know how Jared Polis would self-define. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1567.9s)]
*  I'm just saying these are people that I think a lot of politically homeless Americans would [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1570.9s)]
*  support, precisely because they are rejecting the kind of excessive progressivism that people [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1575.3400000000001s)]
*  feel led to, whatever you want to call it, the disorder, the sense of scarcity. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1581.7s)]
*  I don't think housing scarcity was a liberal versus moderate issue. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1587.14s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1589.9s)]
*  I don't think the issue with Kathy Hochul, for instance, is that she's too progressive. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1591.7s)]
*  I think it has to do with how government itself is run. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1595.46s)]
*  I think they're probably highly progressive. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1598.9s)]
*  For me, they're very progressive flavors of abundance and more moderate flavors of abundance. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1600.58s)]
*  But either are... [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1604.72s)]
*  I know moderates who I see as seeing a very different way to run government than I would [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1605.8600000000001s)]
*  and progressives who do. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1610.74s)]
*  So I think this cuts, this is a slightly different cleavage than inside the Democratic Party [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1612.64s)]
*  or even inside politics, the more traditional moderate to liberal cleavage. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1618.26s)]
*  This is a cleavage. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1622.7s)]
*  It has a lot to do with the question of how do you think government bureaucracies should [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1623.7s)]
*  run? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1628.7s)]
*  What do you think should be done with NEPA? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1629.7s)]
*  In a way, it would be a highly progressive thing to say we're going to have a speed run [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1631.3s)]
*  for all clean energy, but progressives haven't done that and nor have moderates. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1634.66s)]
*  But I guess what I'm saying is those that embrace the market, those that look broadly [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1638.6200000000001s)]
*  at technology as something that can be harnessed for good, in general, I don't feel like that [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1644.5800000000002s)]
*  is something that has a popular constituency among people that I know and describe themselves [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1652.1s)]
*  as being progressive. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1659.1s)]
*  You know what's really interesting about Donald Trump? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1660.1s)]
*  But I want you to make the case for me that it is progressive because that's what you [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1661.1s)]
*  do powerfully in the book. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1664.86s)]
*  Let me try that. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1665.86s)]
*  And then we're going to get into the book. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1666.86s)]
*  Donald Trump is a really remarkable figure in so many ways. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1667.86s)]
*  And one of those ways in which is the way in which he is a machine of negative polarization. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1670.86s)]
*  Almost everything that he does creates a counter movement that believes in the opposite of [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1677.34s)]
*  his policies. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1681.94s)]
*  So for example, Americans were more liberal on immigration policy than any time in recorded [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1682.94s)]
*  history in 2017 and 2018. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1688.42s)]
*  In the very same way, I don't know if you saw this, David Shore released a poll or shared [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1691.26s)]
*  a poll that asked Americans of various ideological self ID. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1694.78s)]
*  How positively do you view free trade? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1699.8600000000001s)]
*  And typically you'd think, okay, it's conservatives who are going to say the most free trade or [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1702.8600000000001s)]
*  certainly moderates. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1705.78s)]
*  It's not just liberals who are the most pro free trade right now. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1707.5s)]
*  It's people who self identify as very liberal. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1711.24s)]
*  So one thing that's happening here that we cannot take our eyes off is that Donald Trump's [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1715.08s)]
*  power of negative polarization has the ability to make the opposition party into his photo [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1718.64s)]
*  negative on so many different issues that we can't rule out the chance that what he's [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1724.48s)]
*  going to accomplish is actually to make the Democratic Party more embracing of the free [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1730.9s)]
*  market rather than less. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1736.26s)]
*  I'm not a complete free market person, but I am, especially in this book, a huge fan [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1737.56s)]
*  of free markets in the places where liberal policies and sometimes constituencies block [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1741.08s)]
*  construction like housing and clean energy. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1747.12s)]
*  But I want to return to make a put a really fine point on something that Ezra said, which [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1749.4199999999998s)]
*  I think is really, really critical. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1752.8799999999999s)]
*  And it goes back to this idea of framing our book and its existence in a world in which [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1754.96s)]
*  Donald Trump is president. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1759.9199999999998s)]
*  You look at his policies and you compare them to the promise of a golden age in America. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1762.08s)]
*  And in fact, what he's offering is very clearly a vision of deprivation. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1768.6399999999999s)]
*  Every scarcity that the White House identifies in America, they think of another scarcity [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1773.74s)]
*  to be its remedy. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1778.58s)]
*  America doesn't have a healthy economy, therefore we need a recession. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1780.32s)]
*  America doesn't have enough houses, therefore we need fewer immigrants. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1784.58s)]
*  America doesn't have enough manufacturing, therefore we need less trade. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1788.6s)]
*  America doesn't have the right kind of science being done, therefore we need less scientific [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1793.2s)]
*  funding. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1798.96s)]
*  Again and again, the Trump answer to the question of what ails America is, let's find everything [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1799.96s)]
*  that we don't have enough of and take something away that we need more of. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1804.8s)]
*  In that context, abundance is the perfect negatively polarized message against the Trump [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1809.0s)]
*  administration. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1814.64s)]
*  We are saying America does have problems in housing, in affordability, in energy. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1815.8600000000001s)]
*  And the answer is not less, it's more. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1821.54s)]
*  And that's not just some kind of slogan to put on the back of a car, maybe not a Tesla. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1824.36s)]
*  It's very literal. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1831.74s)]
*  As Ezra said, Trump could have come into office and been like, I realize that I'm the affordability [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1834.18s)]
*  candidate. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1838.7s)]
*  If you ask Americans in 2024, why'd they switch from Biden to Trump in 2020 to 2024? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1839.94s)]
*  It was affordability, affordability, affordability. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1844.54s)]
*  He could have said, let's make America like Texas. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1847.06s)]
*  Let's make America the most housing abundant country in the world. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1849.46s)]
*  Instead, what does he do? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1852.18s)]
*  He raises tariffs on Canada and Mexico. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1853.3400000000001s)]
*  Totally f-ing random, but let's follow along. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1857.14s)]
*  Our number one source of lumber to build houses comes from Canada. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1860.3s)]
*  Our number one source of gypsum drywall comes from Mexico. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1864.06s)]
*  Two of the most important inputs for any new house you're going to build, we've now slapped [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1867.78s)]
*  a 25% tariff on them. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1871.98s)]
*  There's no way that does anything other than drive housing prices right up. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1875.1s)]
*  And by the way, he's also decreasing immigration. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1879.78s)]
*  25% of the construction labor force is foreign born. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1881.74s)]
*  In California, it's closer to 40%. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1885.48s)]
*  So his answer to the problem of affordability is not to make housing more abundant. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1887.9199999999998s)]
*  It's to tax two of the biggest imports, inputs to housing and make it harder for construction [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1892.62s)]
*  companies to find legal labor. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1898.6599999999999s)]
*  From that standpoint, an abundance message is the perfect negatively polarized liberal [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1902.46s)]
*  response to the Trump administration. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1908.42s)]
*  It is perfectly in keeping with the Democratic Party and doesn't need to be some kind of [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1910.22s)]
*  awkward fit with some new coalition that we're building. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1914.8600000000001s)]
*  Can I ask you a question? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1917.54s)]
*  Yes, you can. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1918.54s)]
*  So when you're saying the sort of free press people, right, the what? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1919.54s)]
*  Not on the disorder side, right? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1923.88s)]
*  I think I have a sense of your politics there. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1924.88s)]
*  But what would if you began hearing like a Democrat running for governor of New York, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1928.22s)]
*  what would they need to say for you to think on the supply side, on affordability, something [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1932.66s)]
*  is going to be different here? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1937.42s)]
*  What would buy credibility to you? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1939.02s)]
*  Here's what I would need to hear. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1940.66s)]
*  Make crime illegal again. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1942.26s)]
*  But that you just went to the disorder side. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1944.58s)]
*  But that is, I am not. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1946.42s)]
*  But that's fine. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1947.42s)]
*  But I think we have a different understanding of what government can promise fundamentally. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1948.42s)]
*  If a politician comes to me and says, and lays out the vision of 2050, I'm never going [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1953.58s)]
*  to buy it because temperamentally, I am someone that is skeptical that government can deliver [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1958.86s)]
*  star pills, whatever we're calling them. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1964.98s)]
*  But housing? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1967.06s)]
*  Housing, yes. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1968.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1969.06s)]
*  Or trains, something on the set like to make subway construction possible again. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1970.06s)]
*  For me, the bar is so low right now that what I'm looking for is reality. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1973.1799999999998s)]
*  In Los Angeles, in our nice upper middle class neighborhood, every single house on our street, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1979.34s)]
*  blocks and blocks and blocks, was burglarized. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1984.62s)]
*  It was not a thing where a woman would go walking alone at night. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1987.3s)]
*  In our neighborhood, where the taxes we were paying were the highest in the country, period. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1991.06s)]
*  It was normal in our neighborhood for everyone to buy into private security, retired cops [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=1996.9399999999998s)]
*  that you would call if you heard a scary noise or someone broke into your house because the [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2003.1399999999999s)]
*  police, again, in the highest tax place in the nation, would not show up. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2007.46s)]
*  I remember in the second week we were there, and maybe this is why I'm fixated on disorder, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2013.02s)]
*  because I've just had all of these experiences, Nellie and I were walking down the street [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2017.6200000000001s)]
*  and a really sweet guy came up to us and was like, I don't have my phone. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2021.58s)]
*  You need to call the police. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2025.8600000000001s)]
*  There's a guy in the middle of the street threatening people and swinging a machete. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2026.8600000000001s)]
*  And he was swinging a machete in broad daylight at 11 in West Hollywood. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2030.66s)]
*  And I called 911 and I had this almost Armando and Nucci-like experience where it was like, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2036.06s)]
*  can you wait until we're there to apprehend this person? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2044.3s)]
*  I'm like, I am here with my wife, we are unarmed, and I am not waiting until you show up to [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2047.1799999999998s)]
*  apprehend this person. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2052.14s)]
*  It was like the experience of the DMV across every area of government. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2053.14s)]
*  And so for me, Ezra, what I'm looking for is so basic, make people safe, clean up the [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2057.38s)]
*  streets, make it so that people, women are not scared to go on the subway on any stop [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2064.66s)]
*  alone at night in New York City. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2069.66s)]
*  Like the number of people I know that have had very negative experiences in the past [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2072.66s)]
*  five years is profound. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2076.66s)]
*  That's like, I'm at the basement level. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2077.66s)]
*  I don't need a vision of utopia. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2080.66s)]
*  I don't need a vision. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2082.66s)]
*  Most of the book is not about star pills. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2083.66s)]
*  I'm saying I don't need a vision. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2085.66s)]
*  I would be happy just with safe. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2087.66s)]
*  Once we have that, then you can sell me on abundance. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2093.1s)]
*  I was having a conversation on another show and it was somebody, I think it's all running [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2096.1s)]
*  together now, but it's somebody I think more on my left. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2101.02s)]
*  And they were saying, isn't the reason so many of these people are leaving California [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2104.54s)]
*  or New York for Florida or Texas, it's just Texas, right? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2110.1s)]
*  People like to go and places. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2112.98s)]
*  No. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2113.98s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to agree with you. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2114.98s)]
*  And what I was saying was that, and this gets to the book, but also gets I think to what [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2115.98s)]
*  you're saying. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2120.98s)]
*  Yes, people are upset about taxes in Los Angeles or San Francisco or New York City, but the [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2121.98s)]
*  way I always hear it said and the way I often feel it myself is not that the taxes are so [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2129.18s)]
*  high but that it gets a little. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2133.94s)]
*  That people are willing to pay for good public services. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2136.14s)]
*  They're willing to pay for a city where the, I mean, for all of its problems, this is the [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2139.78s)]
*  first time I've ever lived in New York. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2145.7400000000002s)]
*  I moved here 18 months ago or whatever it is. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2146.9s)]
*  For all of its problems and there are a lot, the New York subway system is a kind of marvel. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2149.78s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2153.1800000000003s)]
*  I've never lived in a place with this good public transportation. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2154.1800000000003s)]
*  People are willing to pay for even high taxes if their taxes get them something. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2157.1000000000004s)]
*  And one of the big problems in liberal governance, and it's been true on the supply side that [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2162.82s)]
*  we're very focused on, but it's also true on the order and disorder side that you're [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2167.46s)]
*  focused on, is just they're not getting it. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2170.46s)]
*  The taxes are high, but the police don't come. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2173.3s)]
*  The taxes are high, but the subway never expands. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2175.38s)]
*  The taxes are high. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2178.14s)]
*  The perfect example of this and I never appreciated playgrounds and public parks until I had children. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2179.14s)]
*  And the experience of Central Park and the. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2187.18s)]
*  Oh, wonder. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2190.3399999999997s)]
*  It's unreal. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2191.54s)]
*  A wonder. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2192.54s)]
*  It's unreal. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2193.54s)]
*  Crossback Park for me. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2194.54s)]
*  It's a wonder. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2195.54s)]
*  It's our whole life here. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2196.54s)]
*  And in LA, first of all, LA is just, it's not a city in the same way, but the public [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2197.54s)]
*  parks that do exist are scary. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2201.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I don't need to get into all of the different anecdotes, but it was bad enough [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2205.26s)]
*  that you're like, I don't know if we should go to this park. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2211.3s)]
*  And that's just like, that enrages people and they want to be able to take their kid [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2214.5800000000004s)]
*  to a park and feel like, hey, I'm thrilled that my tax dollars are going to keeping Central [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2218.3s)]
*  Park as beautiful and safe as it is. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2223.9s)]
*  It's interesting when you look at some of the happiest people in the world, and this [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2226.0200000000004s)]
*  is a self-selecting thing, of course, but it's often Denmark and Sweden and Norway where [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2229.6600000000003s)]
*  the average tax rate is something like 37%. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2234.1s)]
*  They're very happy in Israel too. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2236.2999999999997s)]
*  And there's something about, I don't know if this is too glib, but it's kind of like [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2238.22s)]
*  the Equinox model of governance. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2242.58s)]
*  Like Equinox is like very, very, very expensive. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2244.22s)]
*  But also, it's very good. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2250.2599999999998s)]
*  And the Kiehl's lotions in the locker rooms are fantastic. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2253.06s)]
*  And you feel like a million bucks when you walk out. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2255.9s)]
*  And every single time you visit, you're like, I got my whatever it is, $275 worth of monthly [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2257.94s)]
*  fees because at every single moment the machines were free, they were cleaned. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2262.58s)]
*  I took a shower and now I'm glowing because I've tripled lotion with Kiehl's. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2266.98s)]
*  There's something really important here that actually... [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2271.94s)]
*  You're really like pumping it to get your values right. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2273.1s)]
*  This is brought to you by Equinox. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2276.18s)]
*  And Kiehl's. It was a co-sponsorship and a co-authorship. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2280.18s)]
*  But there's something to this idea of the Equinox model, because one thing we said earlier [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2283.94s)]
*  is that something's broken down in the degree to which liberals associate success with how [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2288.66s)]
*  much money they can spend rather than what they can accomplish. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2292.8199999999997s)]
*  And that's that break, that cut between how much the system costs and what it delivers. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2295.2999999999997s)]
*  That's a broken Equinox. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2301.42s)]
*  That's an Equinox. That's a gym with Equinox prices, but like gold's gym quality. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2302.8599999999997s)]
*  And I think in too many places what you have... [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2307.2999999999997s)]
*  So you want to stand up for golds now? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2309.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2310.8199999999997s)]
*  I do think that one thing that we're saying over and over again in this book is that in [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2311.94s)]
*  places where liberals have an enormous amount of power, where their power is unmolested by [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2315.34s)]
*  Republican influence, they cannot blame Elon, they cannot blame Trump, they cannot blame [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2320.34s)]
*  the Republicans in the Senate. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2325.82s)]
*  They have the power. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2327.34s)]
*  They're not delivering. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2328.82s)]
*  They're spending more per capita than any other place, but they can't actually deliver [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2330.42s)]
*  results. And I think one thing that we're seeing, and go back to a question you asked earlier [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2334.78s)]
*  where you said, are these people delusional? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2338.2200000000003s)]
*  Are you trying to change their minds when they leave Los Angeles and they leave San [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2340.2200000000003s)]
*  Francisco? Are you trying to grab them and shake them and say, no, absolutely not. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2343.1s)]
*  No, you're saying you're leaving with good reason. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2348.5s)]
*  Values are right. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2350.54s)]
*  It is the state that has failed. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2351.8199999999997s)]
*  And we're trying to find a way to align the quality of governance with the expectations [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2353.86s)]
*  that those residents have. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2359.02s)]
*  I also want to note that just like another prism of this, because we're talking about [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2359.66s)]
*  the person who fled, right? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2364.42s)]
*  The people I know who left San Francisco, in many cases, New York City, in many cases, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2367.02s)]
*  LA, I grew up outside of LA, they didn't want to go. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2372.06s)]
*  Right. The tragedy to me is not even the person who leaves a jurisdiction where they don't [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2375.22s)]
*  like how it's governed. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2379.94s)]
*  And like they don't like it. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2381.1s)]
*  It's the person who desperately wanted to raise their children in the city they love, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2382.34s)]
*  the city they grew up in, the city they met their partner in, the city those children [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2388.22s)]
*  were born in and couldn't afford to. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2391.58s)]
*  One reason we're very focused on cost of living and it's to take nothing away from crime [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2393.58s)]
*  or disorder problems that we're also talking about. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2397.7s)]
*  But one reason we're focused on that is that they are robbing people the lives they want [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2400.06s)]
*  to have. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2405.42s)]
*  I mean, I knew so many people. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2405.94s)]
*  San Francisco is in a sort of like antenatal spiral. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2407.7s)]
*  It has become just too expensive to be there on any kind of working class salary and raise [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2412.8199999999997s)]
*  children. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2417.74s)]
*  So there are fewer and fewer children. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2418.58s)]
*  And I mean, Guinea-Louis Krauss said amazing piece about this on South Korea. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2420.58s)]
*  But you just begin to lose in a city the sort of I don't exactly know what to call it, like [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2423.74s)]
*  the muscle memory of what it's like to have a lot of kids around. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2429.5s)]
*  People get less used to them in restaurants like the infrastructure for them begins to [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2432.3s)]
*  corrode and erode. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2435.74s)]
*  Like I knew people who protected San Francisco like in just like literal essential ways and [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2437.58s)]
*  they were forced out. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2442.82s)]
*  And that's like my like more of my fury rests there. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2444.5s)]
*  Crime is often a hard problem. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2448.62s)]
*  Disorder can often be a very hard problem. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2450.46s)]
*  I live in New York City. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2452.54s)]
*  I just had a bunch of shootings outside my house. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2454.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2455.94s)]
*  Like I that's my experience in New York of crime has been much worse than in SF. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2456.34s)]
*  And when I used to live in D.C. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2460.42s)]
*  was much worse than in either crime is a very hard problem. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2461.5s)]
*  We should make crime illegal. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2464.42s)]
*  But even when you make crime illegal, crime can be a very difficult problem to solve. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2465.46s)]
*  But housing is not an unsolved problem. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2469.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2472.1800000000003s)]
*  Why? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2472.42s)]
*  Like not having a middle class in your city. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2472.78s)]
*  So that's a choice. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2474.78s)]
*  So let's talk about it. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2475.9s)]
*  And that choice is infuriating. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2476.7000000000003s)]
*  Not to keep going back to my neighborhood in L.A. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2479.1000000000004s)]
*  But I think it's instructive. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2481.42s)]
*  When we were living there, there was a proposal to build a not even a New York [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2483.18s)]
*  skyscraper, like maybe a six or eight story apartment complex, middle class [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2488.42s)]
*  affordable housing at the end of a block on the main drag where there were [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2493.18s)]
*  blighted buildings to Nellie and I. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2496.98s)]
*  This seemed incredibly wise, smart, of course, something we would support. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2499.18s)]
*  And what shocked us was that almost everyone in our neighborhood was profoundly [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2504.86s)]
*  opposed to this building going up. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2510.42s)]
*  Now, why was that? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2513.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2514.82s)]
*  These are people who claim to care about affordable housing, who I would say to a [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2515.02s)]
*  person identify as liberal or progressive. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2519.3s)]
*  And yet they were opposed to the very thing they claim to support. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2521.86s)]
*  And it kind of came down to for two reasons. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2525.34s)]
*  One, they didn't want the value of their own homes going down. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2527.46s)]
*  And two, they didn't know the kinds of people that would live there. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2531.2200000000003s)]
*  And let's talk about that because I think that that same story repeats itself. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2534.06s)]
*  I know it for sure from Nellie's experience in San Francisco. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2539.2599999999998s)]
*  That's like the story of San Francisco. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2542.14s)]
*  And they, you know, gussy it up in Gazi language about preserving the character of [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2544.2999999999997s)]
*  the city, which I get it's gorgeous. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2548.8199999999997s)]
*  It's really, really wonderful to live on a street with three story tall row houses [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2551.3799999999997s)]
*  in as far as the eye can see. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2555.94s)]
*  But if you really claim to care about affordable housing, you would say yes, in [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2557.62s)]
*  my backyard to these things. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2561.98s)]
*  And yet the vast majority of people continue to say no. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2563.14s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2566.06s)]
*  How do people kind of get away with that hypocrisy? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2567.82s)]
*  We were sort of like shunned for not signing the petition. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2570.66s)]
*  Talk to me about how that like the politics of that or the hypocritical [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2573.7s)]
*  politics of that plays itself out across so many cities. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2577.7s)]
*  I think there are two levels of this. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2581.34s)]
*  So one is actually the moral level. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2583.5s)]
*  And can you change people's minds morally on this? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2585.2599999999998s)]
*  We are saying in the book, I mean, this is what the yes, my backyard movement says [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2587.74s)]
*  very clearly that kind of liberalism is fundamentally selfish and hypocritical. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2591.22s)]
*  You are not the party of working families. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2595.6600000000003s)]
*  If the places you govern are not places working families can afford to live. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2599.1000000000004s)]
*  If you have the long sign that kind of says everything and no human being is [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2602.82s)]
*  illegal and it's in front of a house in an area zoned for single families, then [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2605.5400000000004s)]
*  no, you do not actually believe any of that. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2610.38s)]
*  You just like the long sign. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2612.34s)]
*  Your politics, I've put it, is symbolic, but not operational. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2613.46s)]
*  Fine. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2616.98s)]
*  But the truth is, like if we're being honest about it, this is true for people's [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2618.42s)]
*  politics, red and blue all over the place. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2621.78s)]
*  People's politics are full of hypocrisy. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2624.18s)]
*  They don't like things to change right around them. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2625.98s)]
*  Of course. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2627.66s)]
*  Defaults matter a lot. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2628.22s)]
*  So in Houston, it's not that the people of Houston somehow all love having big [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2630.54s)]
*  apartment buildings and a lot more building around them, but the building, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2635.4199999999996s)]
*  Houston just doesn't have a zoning code, right? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2639.54s)]
*  There's idiosyncratic historical reasons for that, but they don't have a zoning [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2641.8199999999997s)]
*  code. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2644.7799999999997s)]
*  I was talking to somebody who's a major developer and he just said, look, every [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2645.4199999999996s)]
*  developer knows that it's bad to be a homeowner in Houston and good to be a [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2648.3399999999997s)]
*  developer there. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2652.4199999999996s)]
*  Your homes do not appreciate to the same degree. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2653.1s)]
*  The average home sales are a bit more than $300,000, but it's very easy to build [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2654.98s)]
*  new homes. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2659.58s)]
*  Texas is also building, despite a politics that is much more hostile to renewable [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2660.22s)]
*  energy, a legislature that is constantly proposing new bills to make it harder to [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2664.38s)]
*  build clean energy. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2668.54s)]
*  They are building clean energy at a torrid pace because it's profitable to do [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2669.62s)]
*  so and the default in Texas is it's easy to build. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2673.1s)]
*  So it really matters whether the people who don't want that affordable housing [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2675.86s)]
*  complex, even just like that housing complex down the block, have a place to go [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2680.2599999999998s)]
*  to stop it. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2683.7799999999997s)]
*  There's not a problem with people being frustrated that an apartment building is [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2684.54s)]
*  going up down the block. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2688.9399999999996s)]
*  If you, you know, I live in a big building, you know, if you put another really big [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2690.1s)]
*  building right next to me, I mean, they're a bunch near me, but I live in New York, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2693.22s)]
*  but, you know, maybe I'd be like sad about my view, but there's a really big [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2695.8199999999997s)]
*  difference between I can stop it or I can complain about it. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2699.8599999999997s)]
*  And there are more things that you should not be able to stop. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2704.54s)]
*  You should just be able to complain about. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2707.3799999999997s)]
*  And that's particularly true of housing and cities that are engines of the [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2708.82s)]
*  engines of the economy and should be engines of opportunity and mobility. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2712.82s)]
*  I don't think that the way this politics works out is in the end, you go door to [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2716.86s)]
*  door and convince everybody you're right. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2721.02s)]
*  And that their politics should be sort of free of internal contradiction. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2722.6200000000003s)]
*  I think people are actually adaptable to huge arrays of sort of equilibrium. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2726.2200000000003s)]
*  Tokyo, it's really easy to build. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2733.1800000000003s)]
*  Tokyo is like an incredibly 3d city. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2734.5800000000004s)]
*  If you're ever there, like how vertical it is, is astonishing. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2737.02s)]
*  And, you know, you can buy, you can afford a place in pretty central Tokyo on two [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2740.2599999999998s)]
*  jobs at the median wage. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2745.94s)]
*  People get used to all kinds of things, but if you make it possible for people [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2747.86s)]
*  with a highly appreciating home asset to stop anything from going up near them, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2751.74s)]
*  they fucking will. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2757.1s)]
*  And that like the way to stop that is not to talk them out of their self-interest. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2758.54s)]
*  They might be right about their self-interest. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2761.94s)]
*  They are right about their self-interest. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2763.5s)]
*  Well, in a way, but like they, I mean, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2764.74s)]
*  I would say Californians don't love, like they've created a huge homelessness [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2766.42s)]
*  crisis and I don't think they actually like where they've ended up, right? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2770.62s)]
*  They didn't realize they were doing it. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2772.94s)]
*  Every individual person stopping the housing from going up, but then they have [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2774.5s)]
*  the problems you're talking about, which if you had built enough housing, you'd [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2777.78s)]
*  have a lot fewer of them. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2780.1s)]
*  So I'm not sure in the long run it's all, but let's even say it is. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2781.46s)]
*  That's why things need to not all be done at that level. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2785.06s)]
*  Not everything should be a vetocracy, right? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2787.62s)]
*  The people at the planning board meeting are the people who live there now, not [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2789.66s)]
*  the people who might live there or don't even know the meeting is going on. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2793.3s)]
*  These things are completely non-representative. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2796.3s)]
*  And so you need ways of integrating more information into the decisions and you [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2798.7000000000003s)]
*  need to turn the dials towards the default is we can build as opposed to the [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2802.54s)]
*  default is we can't if anybody has a problem with it. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2806.98s)]
*  Like Ezra, I love breaking my answers down into two parts. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2810.54s)]
*  In fact, when we were having conversations about this book on the phone, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2814.78s)]
*  there was a period where every single time one of us asked a question of the [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2818.0600000000004s)]
*  other, the other person would say that that gives me two different ideas. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2821.94s)]
*  We were talking about any of our two by two matrices in the book. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2826.1s)]
*  You're all so lucky. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2829.2200000000003s)]
*  The dreams, Barry, the dreams of two by two matrices that were felled during [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2830.1s)]
*  the reading process is truly, it's truly tragic. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2834.78s)]
*  So the two pieces here that I want to talk about are there's a legal answer to [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2838.86s)]
*  the question, how in the world is this happening? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2842.06s)]
*  And there's an emotional aspect to the question that I think is really [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2844.54s)]
*  interesting that Ezra touched on. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2846.6600000000003s)]
*  The legal answer is that something really did happen in the 1970s that [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2848.38s)]
*  changed the way we built housing in America. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2851.6600000000003s)]
*  And it was revolution on several fronts. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2853.74s)]
*  Zoning laws proliferated across the country and that was legal and it was [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2857.02s)]
*  cultural and it made it harder. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2860.58s)]
*  It created more rules for buildings to go up. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2862.02s)]
*  But also at the same time, there was a revolution of environmentalism and a [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2864.7s)]
*  revolution of care that was even bigger than environmentalism that happened in [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2870.1s)]
*  1960s and 1970s that led to an enormous amount of regulation in terms of building [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2873.74s)]
*  in the world. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2879.18s)]
*  And so we had the Clean Air and Water Act to clean up the air and the water. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2880.22s)]
*  And we had NEPA and we had even more environmental legislation and we had [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2882.9s)]
*  Ralph Nader coming along and making it much popularizing this idea that if [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2886.82s)]
*  you're a truly good and smart young person, you should become a lawyer and [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2891.5s)]
*  you should devote your life to suing the state and businesses from stopping them [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2895.78s)]
*  in the physical world from doing anything. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2901.14s)]
*  And this led to a world in which it became much easier for people's natural [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2903.54s)]
*  conservatism, right? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2908.46s)]
*  Their ancient idea of, I kind of don't want anything to change in my [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2909.82s)]
*  neighborhood, which is not 50 years old, it's 500,000 years old. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2912.94s)]
*  But that idea suddenly became instrumental. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2916.78s)]
*  It gained instruments of law and these people that might have always felt this [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2919.02s)]
*  sense of conservatism had a way to actually marshal that conservatism and [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2923.7000000000003s)]
*  say, stop, stop, stop. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2927.7000000000003s)]
*  So that's what happened, I think, at the legal level. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2929.86s)]
*  But there's something at the emotional level that I think is really, really [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2932.46s)]
*  interesting. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2935.34s)]
*  It's not entirely in their self-interest to always say stop. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2936.7s)]
*  And the reason why is that people exist or families exist intergenerationally. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2940.1s)]
*  I was having a conversation with, I want to anonymize this appropriately. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2947.3799999999997s)]
*  I have a close friend whose parents I know very well, all of whom live in Los [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2951.8199999999997s)]
*  Angeles. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2956.4199999999996s)]
*  And I was talking to the parents who live in a very well-to-do neighborhood in [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2957.58s)]
*  LA. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2963.06s)]
*  And I was talking to them about their neighborhood and they said, it's so [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2963.94s)]
*  annoying, this construction project they started down the street. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2966.6200000000003s)]
*  They're trying to approve this large development, this housing apartment [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2969.3s)]
*  complex, 200 units. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2972.98s)]
*  It's going to be awful. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2974.94s)]
*  The traffic will be bad. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2975.82s)]
*  I don't know where the parking is going to be. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2976.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't want them to do it. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2978.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm doing everything that I possibly can to round up all my friends on the block [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2979.46s)]
*  and get them to stop adding units to the street. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2982.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2985.82s)]
*  I say, hey, by the way, how's your kids' housing search going? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2986.5800000000004s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2990.2599999999998s)]
*  He said there's nowhere for them to live in the city of Los Angeles. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2991.02s)]
*  It's impossible for them to find a place. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2993.8199999999997s)]
*  It's too expensive. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2995.94s)]
*  So if you ask him about housing- [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2997.2599999999998s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=2999.22s)]
*  Nothing, because he was serving me expensive wine. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3000.22s)]
*  I didn't want to be rude. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3002.2999999999997s)]
*  But deep down I said, when I go on a podcast tour for my book Abundance, I'm [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3003.14s)]
*  going to properly anonymize this conversation. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3006.7799999999997s)]
*  But when you think sort of within, I'm not trying to be too abstract here, but [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3012.8199999999997s)]
*  when you think within one generation, yes, within one generation, in terms of [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3015.8199999999997s)]
*  your housing values over the next 18 months, maybe the addition of more [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3019.38s)]
*  apartment units on your streets will have something to do with the [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3023.9s)]
*  appreciation of your home. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3027.38s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3028.42s)]
*  But don't people want their friends to live near them? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3029.58s)]
*  Don't people want their families to be able to afford a house where they live? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3032.94s)]
*  Like we people pay education taxes even when they send their children to private [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3037.42s)]
*  schools, they pay into social security, even when they're not retired. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3043.54s)]
*  There's other ways in which we have like a slightly different mindset of, you [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3047.1s)]
*  know what, it's altogether proper for me to sacrifice just a little bit now [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3050.3399999999997s)]
*  because of either the greater good or the expectation that's going to come back [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3053.66s)]
*  to me some way down the line. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3056.8999999999996s)]
*  But for whatever reason, some of these cities, we don't have that expectation. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3058.46s)]
*  We don't have that more capacious mindset that says, yeah, it can be a [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3061.2599999999998s)]
*  little bit inconvenient when, you know, there's a parking detour and it's a [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3065.8999999999996s)]
*  little inconvenient when there's construction noise, but also fundamentally [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3069.46s)]
*  deep down, I'm someone who believes in housing abundance, not only for America, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3072.86s)]
*  but also for my own family and my own friends. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3076.94s)]
*  And so in terms of how do we, how do we instrumentalize this? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3079.98s)]
*  How do we actually allow politicians, liberal politicians, politicians that [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3083.94s)]
*  want to call themselves, you know, abundance progressives, you know, what do [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3087.38s)]
*  we tell them to overcome this? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3090.6200000000003s)]
*  And the best answer that I have right now is that there is just no replacement for [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3092.86s)]
*  courage. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3096.98s)]
*  There's no replacement for being a mayor in a city council meeting where you're [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3098.26s)]
*  approving a new development. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3103.06s)]
*  And of the 50 people that come to protest new development, there's maybe two people [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3104.74s)]
*  that come to say, I'm raising my meek little hand here to say, actually do [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3108.42s)]
*  think this new development that we're discussing is worth adding. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3111.42s)]
*  The easy thing to do is to say, I'm looking out at the audience that's screaming at me [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3114.62s)]
*  and 98% of them say that we shouldn't have this development, so I'm going to [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3118.14s)]
*  vote no. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3121.46s)]
*  The harder thing to do, the thing that requires a bit of political courage is to [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3122.42s)]
*  say, I was elected mayor not to represent the people who happened to show up at 9 [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3126.02s)]
*  30 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon in January to talk about a new development who [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3130.74s)]
*  happened to be here today and people who show up at these meetings, they tend to [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3134.5s)]
*  be older, they tend to be richer, they tend to already own homes. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3138.66s)]
*  The thing that takes political courage is to say, I represent all the people in the [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3142.46s)]
*  city and frankly, I want this city to grow, which means that I am interested in [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3147.06s)]
*  providing housing units to people who don't even live in this city yet, because I [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3151.54s)]
*  believe in growth. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3155.58s)]
*  And so I think it requires a little bit of gumption and chutzpah for more political [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3157.2999999999997s)]
*  leaders to say, I'm not going to be felled by the groups that are the loudest or the [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3162.86s)]
*  individuals and complainers that are the loudest. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3167.18s)]
*  I'm going to remember my political North Star and I'm going to put a little bit of [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3169.54s)]
*  extra weight on always voting yes on these kind of developments rather than [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3173.98s)]
*  allowing my politics to be dragged around by the loudest voice. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3177.9s)]
*  OK, just to draw a line under building and then I want to talk a little bit about [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3181.58s)]
*  high speed rail for people that are listening to this saying, this sounds good. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3184.42s)]
*  I like this. In addition to buying your book, who are the politicians out there, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3189.2200000000003s)]
*  like name a few that are exemplifying Derek the kind of courage you're expressing? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3192.82s)]
*  Who are the people you mentioned, Jared Polis, Ritchie Torres, who are the people [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3197.7400000000002s)]
*  that are leaving out the policy of abundance when it comes to housing? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3200.94s)]
*  I want to say, like at this moment, I don't really think we know. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3208.14s)]
*  OK. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3211.1s)]
*  Like even some of the people who I'm interested to see what Ritchie Torres [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3212.54s)]
*  actually proposes here, right? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3215.66s)]
*  It's all easy to speak the words. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3217.74s)]
*  And, you know, the rhetoric of pro housing has become very popular in the [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3219.94s)]
*  Democratic Party. Kamala Harris sort of began sounding like a yin-bi on the stage. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3225.7s)]
*  You know, President Obama talked like a yin-bi on the stage. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3229.18s)]
*  But Harris's proposals just were not very strong. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3232.3399999999997s)]
*  They would not have built three million new homes. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3235.38s)]
*  Like everybody I spoke to who's a housing expert agreed on that. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3237.18s)]
*  It's proposing something that is difficult here, which is they're going to have to rip [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3240.7000000000003s)]
*  up a bunch of government rules and approaches and offer something new in their [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3247.38s)]
*  place, something I always thought was very telling about the Biden administration. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3253.02s)]
*  They passed the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3256.3s)]
*  It's really their signature piece of legislation. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3257.9s)]
*  And they understood perfectly well that the biggest standing after that between them [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3260.94s)]
*  and the decarbonized future they were hoping to achieve was not money, because [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3266.06s)]
*  now they put a lot of money behind it. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3269.66s)]
*  It was permitting and procurement problems. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3271.3799999999997s)]
*  If you even built all this electricity, how do you move the electricity from where [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3273.66s)]
*  it was generated to where it was needed? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3277.14s)]
*  We don't have enough transmission lines. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3279.18s)]
*  Instead of ever putting forward their own permitting reform proposal, instead of [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3281.54s)]
*  putting forward a new approach to doing environmental review, they let Joe [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3287.8199999999997s)]
*  Manchin take the heat for them. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3291.2599999999998s)]
*  And then the progressives hated Joe Manchin, so that got killed. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3293.06s)]
*  And then nothing. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3295.98s)]
*  They never came out and said, look, this is the part our side doesn't love. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3297.22s)]
*  They were very coalitional, right? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3301.8999999999996s)]
*  Like something for everybody who was on the left. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3303.3799999999997s)]
*  But when it split the left, they didn't want to do it. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3306.02s)]
*  And that's what I am waiting to see. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3309.4199999999996s)]
*  That's to me, the courage Derek is talking about, because yes, you need to say the [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3311.74s)]
*  right things, but also then you're going to need to do the right things. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3315.7799999999997s)]
*  I've watched governors start talking like they're an abundance type. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3318.8199999999997s)]
*  And then I see a news story about how they're really against its transmission [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3324.82s)]
*  lines, because in this particular case, right? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3328.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3330.5800000000004s)]
*  And the other problem, and like, this is always a problem in politics, is nobody [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3331.2200000000003s)]
*  is excited about the fight over process. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3336.2200000000003s)]
*  Nobody's excited about the fight to change the rules. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3338.9s)]
*  That doesn't get you anything in the near term. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3341.54s)]
*  You don't get to put your name on a bridge, but you got to do it. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3343.6600000000003s)]
*  And I think people are starting to think about it. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3347.7000000000003s)]
*  The thing I found most exciting this week was Brian Deese, a former National [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3349.58s)]
*  Economics Council Director under Obama, put out this foreign affairs article. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3354.9s)]
*  And I mean, this guy who was involved in negotiating every one of these bills. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3358.9s)]
*  And it's a hardcore piece on what we would need to do to build more. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3362.7799999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3366.34s)]
*  It was like, these are hard targets for how much nuclear we should be aiming to build. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3366.7s)]
*  This is how you should take away federal money from jurisdictions that are not [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3371.14s)]
*  allowing you to build new homes. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3375.2599999999998s)]
*  And that was really exciting. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3376.7799999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3378.2599999999998s)]
*  That was something where if I saw people begin to pick that up, I'm looking to see [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3378.46s)]
*  what Pete Buttigieg does. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3381.9s)]
*  Here's a guy who is running Department of Transportation. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3383.38s)]
*  He knows how hard this is. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3385.66s)]
*  I want to see if he comes out on this. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3387.42s)]
*  Right? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3388.98s)]
*  He's begun talking about it. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3389.1s)]
*  Right? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3390.26s)]
*  He's been talking about yimbyism and housing, but I haven't seen the policies yet. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3390.42s)]
*  It's going to be easy. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3394.78s)]
*  Abundance all sounds good. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3395.7s)]
*  More good things for people. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3396.9s)]
*  Great. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3398.06s)]
*  But then you start making proposals and the interest groups that are part of your [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3398.78s)]
*  coalition begin yelling at you and people have a tendency to blanch and want to give [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3401.62s)]
*  everybody a little bit. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3405.2200000000003s)]
*  And the thing about remaking a party, the thing about remaking an ideology, the thing [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3406.7000000000003s)]
*  about atoning for the mistakes you have made in governing in your past, is it actually [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3412.1800000000003s)]
*  creates a lot of internal conflict. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3416.86s)]
*  Donald Trump, say what you will about Donald Trump. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3418.82s)]
*  I got a lot to say about Donald Trump. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3420.7000000000003s)]
*  He did this in the Republican Party. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3422.3s)]
*  When he came in and he took it over, he said, the Bushes, they completely fucked us all [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3423.7400000000002s)]
*  over. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3427.78s)]
*  Right? [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3428.1800000000003s)]
*  They lied us into war. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3428.38s)]
*  He said, we've been ripped off over and over again on trade deals. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3429.7000000000003s)]
*  He said this entire consensus about China is wrong. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3432.42s)]
*  He called his strikes. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3435.14s)]
*  He said who had done wrong and he said he was going to do different. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3437.3799999999997s)]
*  And when people got mad at him, he took the fight on. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3440.3399999999997s)]
*  And doubled down. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3443.66s)]
*  You can't do this. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3444.54s)]
*  It's not just going to be a new consensus that emerges fully formed. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3445.7799999999997s)]
*  Democrats don't want to pick a villain. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3448.4199999999996s)]
*  Democrats don't want to pick a... [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3450.3399999999997s)]
*  The problem on the right is the personality type has become autocratic and the problem [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3451.5s)]
*  on the left is a personality type is bureaucratic. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3454.7799999999997s)]
*  And both could frankly use a little bit of the other's personality in them. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3457.14s)]
*  Like the Democratic politicians need to be more willing to piss people off and to say, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3462.02s)]
*  I don't think that rule there is actually a rule. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3468.18s)]
*  I think that's a norm. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3470.58s)]
*  I think that's something we can change or undo. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3471.58s)]
*  Right? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3474.1s)]
*  I don't want them to go all the way where Doge does where it's somewhat lawless, but I [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3474.26s)]
*  don't want to see them take every advisory opinion from the lawyer. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3477.3s)]
*  But if Doge is a heroine, you want like the pot version of Doge. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3481.7000000000003s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3484.26s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3484.82s)]
*  I'm trying to think of which drug exactly, but yeah, something. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3485.3s)]
*  Yeah, I certainly want a version of Doge whose effect on the brain is less chaotic. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3488.5s)]
*  There's a way... [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3494.58s)]
*  I want different ends than Doge actually has. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3495.22s)]
*  But I think one of the challenges that you guys and this book and the arguments you're [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3497.9s)]
*  making will run into is I feel like we're in a moment where whatever drug you want to [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3504.18s)]
*  choose, the heroine version of the argument, the strong version of the argument wins, goes [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3509.18s)]
*  viral, is the stickiest, picks up the most excitement. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3514.22s)]
*  And the nuanced, complex version of it, whether it's on the center left or the center [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3517.8599999999997s)]
*  right, feels like a loser right now. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3521.8199999999997s)]
*  How do you contend with that? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3524.22s)]
*  Because for someone that's like, wait, yeah, abundance, more technology, good. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3525.5s)]
*  That's why we named it abundance. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3530.3399999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3531.98s)]
*  It's a great name. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3532.18s)]
*  It's great branding. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3532.98s)]
*  But they might say, wait, like there are versions of this that exist. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3533.62s)]
*  How about Texas? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3538.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, abundance exists in Texas. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3539.7799999999997s)]
*  Housing exists in Texas. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3542.2599999999998s)]
*  Energy exists in Texas. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3544.14s)]
*  All of the things that you guys are articulating. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3545.5s)]
*  Maybe let's put climate to the side for a second. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3547.86s)]
*  But most of it, it exists. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3550.98s)]
*  And that's a red state run by a Republican governor. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3552.82s)]
*  How do you contend with that? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3556.66s)]
*  Like just, do you understand what I'm asking? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3558.18s)]
*  Like positionally? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3559.98s)]
*  The National Republican Party is just not saying let's be like Texas in terms of making [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3560.9s)]
*  it easier to build houses. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3565.1s)]
*  Let's be like Texas in terms of making it easier to build renewable energy. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3566.1s)]
*  They're saying the opposite on both sides, to be clear. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3569.62s)]
*  The average citizen is saying, look at California and look at Texas. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3571.82s)]
*  One is better. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3575.54s)]
*  I think scarcity and abundance is a cut inside both parties right now. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3576.34s)]
*  And what... [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3581.5s)]
*  You guys love this word cut. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3582.1400000000003s)]
*  I do like that word cut. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3583.38s)]
*  I'm actually using it. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3584.34s)]
*  You guys are using it in different ways though. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3585.2200000000003s)]
*  I used the word cut with my wife last night and I was like, Jesus Christ, I've done way [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3587.1800000000003s)]
*  too many hours of podcasts. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3590.5s)]
*  No, but like Ezra has incepted you on this word. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3591.6600000000003s)]
*  It's great. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3594.54s)]
*  Especially when someone likes saying... [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3595.02s)]
*  Is it a version of riff? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3596.46s)]
*  Is it a version of riff? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3597.46s)]
*  The way you're using it? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3599.1800000000003s)]
*  No, it's... [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3599.98s)]
*  A distinction. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3600.94s)]
*  Well, a distinction. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3601.38s)]
*  A distinction, okay. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3602.42s)]
*  Because you're using it in different ways. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3603.1400000000003s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3604.62s)]
*  But yeah, give me the cut. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3605.54s)]
*  In both parties, there's I think an abundance side of that party and a scarcity side of that party. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3606.34s)]
*  I agree with that. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3612.1s)]
*  And so on the left, it has more environmental dimensions. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3612.9s)]
*  It's degrowth, right? [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3615.7000000000003s)]
*  On the right, it's sort of the populist right. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3616.82s)]
*  It's against immigration. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3619.1800000000003s)]
*  It feels that there aren't really positive some deals to be made in trade. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3620.54s)]
*  And there are people on the right. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3624.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, Tyler Cowan, mistake capacity libertarianism. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3626.26s)]
*  Jim Pethacuchus, right? [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3629.46s)]
*  The Niskanen Center, who are trying to pursue versions of the right that I would find more congenial. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3630.5s)]
*  Right? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3636.26s)]
*  There are places where we would converge, places where we would diverge. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3636.66s)]
*  But genuinely, I wish them... [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3638.94s)]
*  Many where you converge. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3639.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, many where we converge. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3640.7400000000002s)]
*  Politics is not all zero or negative sum. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3642.82s)]
*  Of course. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3645.14s)]
*  And then on the left, there is the same. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3645.94s)]
*  I agree with that. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3647.62s)]
*  And so the person who would say this is all... [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3648.42s)]
*  Okay, but putting it in your terms, why is the scarcity version, what I'm calling the strong version of the argument, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3649.86s)]
*  you're framing it in a different way that also works. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3655.94s)]
*  Why is that so compelling right now? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3658.42s)]
*  Why is there so much energy with smart people who are getting behind this idea of degrowth? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3660.98s)]
*  If you want to look at the right, why are so many smart people getting behind the idea of 20% tariffs on friendly neighbors? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3665.7000000000003s)]
*  Do you see what I'm trying to say? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3674.26s)]
*  I think we're at the end of an old political argument. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3676.42s)]
*  And we're at the end of a political order. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3680.5s)]
*  You know, Gary Gerstel, this term, we'll call it the neoliberal order. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3682.82s)]
*  And there was a sort of left neoliberalism, a right neoliberalism is market trusting. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3685.22s)]
*  It believed in free trade. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3689.4599999999996s)]
*  And it did a lot of good. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3691.14s)]
*  It did do a lot of things that were necessary. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3693.14s)]
*  And then in different ways, it also created, particularly as it found problems it couldn't solve or it stopped trying to solve, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3695.3799999999997s)]
*  a bunch of scarcities. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3702.02s)]
*  And one of the deadly ironies of scarcity is it creates a politics of more scarcity. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3703.2999999999997s)]
*  When we don't feel like we have enough, we become suspicious of anybody we think might take more. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3709.14s)]
*  When we don't feel like we have enough, we become suspicious of anything that is coming from the outside. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3713.22s)]
*  I mean, this is all in the psychological literature is rich in history, it's rich. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3717.54s)]
*  And again, it's something you see from Donald Trump and JD Vance on the campaign trail. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3721.54s)]
*  So I wouldn't say it's a moderate nuanced argument versus like the immoderate, unnuanced argument. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3725.4599999999996s)]
*  But in terms of what I hear you saying, which is that there is an incredible pulsing energy to arguments of scarcity right now. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3730.02s)]
*  It is because the old order has problems it did not solve. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3738.3399999999997s)]
*  So there are real like environmental problems I get. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3741.7s)]
*  I deeply get the feeling that we human beings are doing something to the world that is fundamentally immoral. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3744.1s)]
*  Biodiversity loss is shocking when you really get into it and think about it. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3752.58s)]
*  The amount of deforestation is shocking. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3756.66s)]
*  I get why that would take you there. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3758.1s)]
*  I just don't think the growth is going to work. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3759.7s)]
*  And I think that it is completely possible and actually likely that if we had the politics right, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3761.2999999999997s)]
*  that we could create a much deeper synthesis of growth and greenness. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3766.5s)]
*  I mean, there's a reason the cover of our book looks the way it does, right? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3772.82s)]
*  We actually are really trying to think about how to re synthesize growth and sort of green future. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3775.3s)]
*  But on the right, too, the right failed itself. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3780.5s)]
*  The right failed its own voters. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3784.18s)]
*  The reason there is so much anger at George W. Bush and Paul Ryan and the version of the Republican Party that came before [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3786.58s)]
*  is that the people that they were supposedly representing over time felt completely unrepresented. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3793.22s)]
*  They were angry about wages. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3799.2999999999997s)]
*  They were angry about immigration. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3800.9s)]
*  They were angry about their kids being sent to wars that never went anywhere and were built on lies. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3802.34s)]
*  And so somebody comes along and says, these people are fucking you and they're weak. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3807.2999999999997s)]
*  And you've not been getting a good deal this whole time. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3813.22s)]
*  There's always a scarcity answer to scarcity. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3816.02s)]
*  There's always a when there are problems. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3819.38s)]
*  Like, let's retreat. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3822.02s)]
*  Let's pull back. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3822.98s)]
*  Like, let's get more careful. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3823.7s)]
*  Let's look with more suspicion on the people outside of us. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3825.06s)]
*  That is one of the very strong threads of this moment. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3828.5s)]
*  And there's also the opposite. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3831.78s)]
*  I mean, we genuinely do believe that abundance is a possibility of a political order. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3833.54s)]
*  It is a possibility that both the right and the left could absorb some of its fundamental tenants in different ways [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3840.02s)]
*  and argue about how to create supply and which supply to create. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3845.78s)]
*  There's no teleology to this. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3849.78s)]
*  The arc of history has not necessarily been towards our politics, but it is one possible answer. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3852.02s)]
*  It is like one possible future. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3857.7s)]
*  You see different politicians embracing it. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3859.38s)]
*  I would be thrilled with a world where what we had was a fight between politicians on different sides [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3861.3s)]
*  and how to create a better version of more in the future. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3867.3s)]
*  That's not where we are, but politics is fluid at the moment. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3870.1s)]
*  The reality of periods when you've exhausted a political order is that the boundaries become mutable. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3874.58s)]
*  If there's anything that is true about the era of politics we've been living through, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3879.46s)]
*  it's the things we thought could not be questioned turn out to be completely questionable. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3883.38s)]
*  The politicians we thought could not get to the center and represent the mainstream of American politics [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3887.2200000000003s)]
*  became the mainstream of American politics. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3892.98s)]
*  Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are both more vibrant political figures today [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3895.3s)]
*  than Hillary Clinton or Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3899.78s)]
*  Things are changing really fast because nothing is settled into a new equilibrium. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3903.06s)]
*  So we are in this molten moment and it can be shaped in better ways and worse ways. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3907.22s)]
*  We think this is one of the better ones. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3912.4199999999996s)]
*  I want to take this term, political order, which Ezra introduced to me, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3914.2599999999998s)]
*  it was coined by Gary Gerstel who's a historian at the University of Cambridge. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3917.7799999999997s)]
*  And I want to just tell a brief history of the way that Gerstel understands the last 100 years of America [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3921.7799999999997s)]
*  and how I think it in a really beautiful way on ramps us not only to the necessity of abundance, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3927.62s)]
*  both lower case A and upper case A, but also how it answers your direct question of how do you make [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3932.34s)]
*  a nuanced message simple. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3939.54s)]
*  I feel like you were like the best high school debate champion of our generation. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3943.54s)]
*  You're incredible. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3947.6200000000003s)]
*  I never did high school debate. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3948.42s)]
*  But let's go. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3949.54s)]
*  Gerstel says there's been two political orders that define the last 90 years. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3956.5s)]
*  And a political order he defines as a tacit agreement between the parties. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3961.1400000000003s)]
*  The ways that the parties agree with each other shapes history more than the way the parties disagree. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3967.1400000000003s)]
*  It's a really interesting idea. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3972.82s)]
*  And he says that political orders work because they last longer than two, four, and six-year election cycles. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3974.7400000000002s)]
*  So the first political order that we had in the 20th century was New Deal liberalism. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3979.3s)]
*  And it arose because there were questions that had to be answered. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3983.3s)]
*  The economy had fallen apart. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3986.5s)]
*  People had lost their faith in capitalism. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3987.86s)]
*  At the same time, the specter of global socialism was swirling around. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3990.1s)]
*  And what FDR did very cleverly is redefine an era of muscular government that said we're going to build [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=3993.94s)]
*  and protect the people by taking a little bit, just a little sluice of socialism and injecting it into the American economy [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4000.98s)]
*  and finding a way to really remake government for a time. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4007.54s)]
*  And the way you know a political order is real is that someone from the opposite party acquiesces to it. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4011.38s)]
*  So Dwight Eisenhower becomes president in the 1950s. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4017.46s)]
*  Does he say, I'm tired of this whole building thing with the New Deal? [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4020.66s)]
*  Does he say I want to tear down social welfare? [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4023.78s)]
*  The exact opposite. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4025.94s)]
*  Dwight Eisenhower in many ways governs like whatever it would have been, the sixth term of FDR. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4026.9s)]
*  He says, I believe in social welfare. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4032.82s)]
*  I believe in building in the world. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4034.5s)]
*  And so he did, interstate highway system. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4035.86s)]
*  1970s comes along and the New Deal order falls apart. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4038.02s)]
*  Inflation is crazy. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4041.06s)]
*  Stackflation is crazy. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4042.1s)]
*  The Soviet Union is a different kind of animal than we were dealing with in the 1930s. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4043.7s)]
*  And a new kind of social, a new kind of political order comes around that Gerstel calls neoliberalism. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4048.42s)]
*  And the way to synthesize neoliberalism is to basically say this was a political order of individualism. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4053.94s)]
*  It was a political order of allowing companies and individuals to be free of overweening government bureaucracies. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4058.74s)]
*  And it was popular on the New Left with the beatniks. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4066.2599999999998s)]
*  It was popular on the far right or the libertarian right with Milton Friedman. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4068.5s)]
*  And you know, per Gerstel, that this neoliberal order worked because Bill Clinton acquiesced to it. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4072.5s)]
*  And Jimmy Carter. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4078.98s)]
*  And Jimmy Carter acquiesced to it even before FDR. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4079.7s)]
*  Jimmy Carter deregulated. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4082.26s)]
*  Clinton cut the government. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4083.94s)]
*  Both of them governed much more like Ronald Reagan than like FDR. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4085.3s)]
*  So that's really interesting. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4090.1s)]
*  We've had these two political orders that defined a hundred years of American history. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4091.14s)]
*  And the last 10 years, the political order has fallen apart. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4095.22s)]
*  It's fallen apart because of the Great Recession. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4099.62s)]
*  It's fallen apart because of the slow recovery. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4101.46s)]
*  It's fallen apart because of the pandemic. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4103.3s)]
*  It's fallen apart because of the affordability crisis. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4104.9800000000005s)]
*  Hat tip Annie Lowry. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4107.06s)]
*  It's fallen apart because things keep happening. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4108.42s)]
*  Maybe because we're living through the most radical technological innovation in human history. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4111.38s)]
*  Not quite like the 19th century, but also it's... [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4116.74s)]
*  I actually think China is really important. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4118.42s)]
*  One of the things that Gerstel does that I think is so important is making clear how much the antagonist who dominates our imagination ends up shaping our domestic politics. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4120.74s)]
*  So Hitler and Cold War and now? [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4130.18s)]
*  And now China. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4132.820000000001s)]
*  And there are different versions of China that are ripping us off. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4133.62s)]
*  The other version, which I think has been a shadow pressure on us, is that they're just outbuilding us. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4136.18s)]
*  And this has been something people have been talking about in American politics now for a long time. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4140.820000000001s)]
*  But the other part of the order is that the things we were doing before the neoliberal order, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4144.5s)]
*  which is just shipping trade all around the world and assuming that China would liberalize, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4149.14s)]
*  one of the things that broke it was simply China. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4152.900000000001s)]
*  And the destruction of the consensus that they would always be our friend, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4156.5s)]
*  that the richer they got, the more like us they would become. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4160.58s)]
*  And that we did not have to re-industrialize or have the kind of base or have the kind of building capacity [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4163.3s)]
*  that would keep us both competitive and in certain ways ahead of them. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4168.42s)]
*  But it's interesting. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4172.34s)]
*  It's kind of like that assumption was based on the fumes of the Cold War order. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4173.0599999999995s)]
*  Like I remember being at the Wall Street Journal editorial page and that was totally the assumption. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4180.099999999999s)]
*  In the same way that like American genes brought down the Berlin Wall and they grew about it. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4184.1s)]
*  The same rule would apply to China and it hasn't. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4188.660000000001s)]
*  And that was wrong. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4192.02s)]
*  One way to think about it is that political orders are defined by both internal crises [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4193.620000000001s)]
*  and external insecurity. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4197.46s)]
*  And we have an internal crisis right now of unaffordability and housing and even in some places, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4199.780000000001s)]
*  disorder. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4204.42s)]
*  And we have an external insecurity with the rise of China, this power that we don't know what to do with. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4205.06s)]
*  And we're stuck in a potential trap with them. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4209.3s)]
*  Thucydides trap. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4212.9s)]
*  The word didn't occur to me as I was in the middle of the sentence, but then it did occur to me. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4214.0199999999995s)]
*  Thucydides trap. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4216.82s)]
*  So what now? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4218.259999999999s)]
*  Answer your question. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4219.54s)]
*  You said there's a lot of people that may be on the center right or on the right that might be just as amenable to this [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4221.94s)]
*  as maybe someone like on left of center. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4225.78s)]
*  Well, political orders are about building an idea that's stronger than the 48%. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4228.66s)]
*  The 48% versus 48% world that we live in today. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4234.179999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4237.139999999999s)]
*  A political order only thrives if you make it an idea that's strong enough to make the other side acquiesce to it just a bit. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4237.38s)]
*  But I see just to play along with this political order thing, which is really, I love it. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4243.7s)]
*  It's really fun. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4248.34s)]
*  You see that already, right? [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4249.86s)]
*  You see it with you guys and the abundance agenda and to code it sort of on the center right, you see it with people like [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4251.3s)]
*  Catherine Boyle and the whole American dynamism idea. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4257.86s)]
*  Those are just two sides. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4260.82s)]
*  They're different expressions of exactly the same idea. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4263.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4265.86s)]
*  Yeah, I think our politics are not the exact same. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4266.660000000001s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4269.46s)]
*  But what's important is that there's an enormous amount of overlap. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4269.620000000001s)]
*  But if we're looking for what's in the 40 yard line, that's already emerging. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4272.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Marc Andre, you brought up Marc Andreessen earlier. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4276.02s)]
*  I brought him up only because it's like building, building, build, build. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4278.820000000001s)]
*  But both Marc Andreessen's Why Can't We Build and his Techno Optimist Manifesto are just incredibly interesting and important documents to me. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4281.14s)]
*  Both because I agree with so much of them and then I disagree with big parts of them. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4288.9800000000005s)]
*  Why can't we build more just because I think it is a little, it does not take institutions seriously. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4293.86s)]
*  It actually just doesn't answer its own question. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4298.259999999999s)]
*  But the Techno Optimist Manifesto, because I don't love the term techno optimist, but fundamentally, I believe we should solve problems through technology. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4300.34s)]
*  And what he would unleash and the way he thinks about regulation is not how I do it. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4307.7s)]
*  But I actually understand this as sort of opposite sides of like a top quadrant. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4312.66s)]
*  And then there's like the scarcity sides, the techno pessimist sides. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4317.54s)]
*  And as we were talking about, the right has it all inside of it, as the left does. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4320.58s)]
*  I mean, inside the Trump administration are deep techno pessimists, people who believe everything has gone awry. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4324.98s)]
*  And you think about the sort of vote for reactionary thinking on the right, like Bronze Age pervert, right? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4331.22s)]
*  The throwbacks to things that are almost like Athens and Sparta. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4338.22s)]
*  And then you have things like Andreessen in a different way, Elon Musk, right? [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4341.7s)]
*  What makes this version of Donald Trump so much more dynamic than the first version is the extraordinarily different kinds of movements embedded in his single administration. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4346.1s)]
*  Right? Like there is so much more ideological diversity in Trump 2 than there was in Trump 1 and so much less is settled. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4356.34s)]
*  I mean, watching Donald Trump up there doing an infomercial for Tesla and be like, it's all computer. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4362.9800000000005s)]
*  Like, is just a fascinating moment in American history. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4367.3s)]
*  Everything's computer, right? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4369.86s)]
*  Is a fascinating moment in politics. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4371.46s)]
*  And the left has versions of that, too, right? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4373.3s)]
*  These are it. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4375.860000000001s)]
*  There is no answer on which side of this on either side will win out. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4378.06s)]
*  But you can see these two versions fighting to express themselves. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4382.26s)]
*  And I think you could see an emergent consensus based on building and kind of a positive version of the future. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4386.780000000001s)]
*  And you can also see maybe even stronger, a different emerging consensus that's based on a much darker vision of where we could be going. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4395.26s)]
*  Yeah, R.F.K. Jr. represents this in a different way for us. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4402.78s)]
*  He's very skeptical of science, very skeptical of where the journey has gone. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4405.42s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4408.74s)]
*  Yeah, like I mean, that's a... [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4409.46s)]
*  I see R.F.K. is being very anti-technology. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4410.74s)]
*  I don't think R.F.K. is pro any technology invented since penicillin. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4412.66s)]
*  I mean, he was anti-nuclear. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4415.62s)]
*  He's anti-Wi-Fi. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4417.46s)]
*  He's anti-broadband. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4418.7s)]
*  He's anti all the vaccines that have been invented since measles. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4420.0599999999995s)]
*  He's not particularly hot on measles. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4422.42s)]
*  I see him as being quite anti-tech. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4424.5s)]
*  And bronze age pervert E in the nice way that I mean. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4428.78s)]
*  Very throwback. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4433.78s)]
*  He believes in the kind of conservatism that takes us back to a kind of health approach. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4435.5s)]
*  Yeah, May cooking's baths tallow again. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4440.5s)]
*  He doesn't like GMOs, right? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4443.5s)]
*  Yeah, he's not going to like lab-grown meat. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4444.98s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4446.78s)]
*  Definitely not. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4447.78s)]
*  Okay, so people who read the book, and I really recommend that they read it, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4448.78s)]
*  they are going to get so much on government dysfunction on the material in this book on high speed rail in California is particularly enraging to me as someone who would have absolutely loved and hopefully in the future will love to go from San Francisco to L.A. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4453.66s)]
*  But I kind of want to take what time we have remaining to look forward and talk about innovation and also birth rate, which I see as absolutely fundamental to the abundance picture. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4470.78s)]
*  If you can't have kids, kind of what's the point? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4475.78s)]
*  And I feel that a lot of people are stuck in a trap where they feel that that's not possible for them. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4484.34s)]
*  So let's maybe let's start with natalism and the future. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4489.34s)]
*  I feel like this is a subject that is being taken up most obviously by the South African Nick Cannon, Elon Musk. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4494.34s)]
*  But in general, I feel like it's a cause being taken up by the right right now, which I think is sort of strange and shouldn't be coded right or left to me. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4499.34s)]
*  But Derek, give me your cut, if you will, on natalism and how the ability to have kids and to afford them fits into the abundance agenda. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4512.34s)]
*  Ultimately, the abundance agenda isn't worth shit if it's not about living a good life. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4521.9800000000005s)]
*  We want people to be able to live the life they want to live. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4526.98s)]
*  And people don't want to have kids. That's fine. I have a child. I absolutely adore her. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4531.98s)]
*  And I think that people should feel free to have more children. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4536.98s)]
*  And right now it's very clear to me if you look at surveys that people want many more children than they actually have. There's all sorts of impediments. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4541.98s)]
*  I think it's important to be clear about what problems our book can solve and what problems our book can't solve. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4546.98s)]
*  There are problems that exist in the world of sociology that cannot maybe be solved by housing energy alone. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4551.98s)]
*  So right now, for example, teenagers, I think largely because of their phones, are less likely to see each other in the physical world than any time for which we have good data. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4559.98s)]
*  They date each other less. They go out with their friends less. They have fewer friends than ever. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4567.98s)]
*  So it's only natural if you think that the warp and weft of society is changing because of our digitization of life, that there's all sorts of ways in which that's changing. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4572.98s)]
*  And that's just going to redound to less children. And our solutions can't fix all those problems. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4581.98s)]
*  But they can fix a lot of them. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4587.98s)]
*  It is not an accident that New York City and Chicago and Los Angeles and San Francisco aren't just bleeding the working class. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4592.98s)]
*  They're specifically bleeding working class families with young children. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4599.98s)]
*  According to the census, if current trends continue, the under five population of new-age children are likely to be the most likely to be affected by the warp and weft of society. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4604.98s)]
*  And that is a shame. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4611.98s)]
*  New York, LA, Chicago and San Francisco, the under five population of these cities will decline by 50% in 20 years. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4616.98s)]
*  We are co-creating, by purpose or by accident, the childless city. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4621.98s)]
*  And that is a shanda. That is an absolute shame. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4626.98s)]
*  And those are problems that I think can be fixed by working on the lever of affordability. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4631.98s)]
*  From the places that they want to live, cities, to the places that they can afford to live, which is outside of those cities. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4636.98s)]
*  So that's why our book begins with housing. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4642.98s)]
*  Because housing is not just about the walls and the ceiling and the floor. Housing is everything. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4647.98s)]
*  Housing is the quantum field of urban life. It touches everything. It's about childcare costs. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4652.98s)]
*  It's about innovation. It's about commute times and where you work. It's about who you live next to. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4657.98s)]
*  I think that a pro-natalist policy, as we're already seeing among all the people on the right and the left, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4662.98s)]
*  that are trying to fix this here in Europe, around the world, this is a hard thing to solve. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4667.98s)]
*  It's hard to solve because it is enmeshed in the new way that we live. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4672.98s)]
*  But to the extent that we can solve it, housing is the biggest piece here. And that's why we begin with housing. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4677.98s)]
*  Well, what about tax subsidies? I mean, what about, I mean, I know these are sacred cows on both sides, [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4682.98s)]
*  but the hundreds of billions that go to Social Security, that go to Medicare, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4687.98s)]
*  a lot of our tax dollars are going to the elderly and not going to the people that are not yet here to be born [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4692.98s)]
*  and will not be because of. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4697.98s)]
*  So what about things like birth subsidies? I know JD Vance has talked about lower taxes on parents. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4702.98s)]
*  There was an idea, I don't know if it was a gag or not, of giving parents additional votes. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4707.98s)]
*  Do you have any policies of that sort? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4712.98s)]
*  Yeah, look, I'm a left natalist. I think that the birth rates are a problem. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4717.98s)]
*  I don't know that we have a policy lever that will work. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4722.98s)]
*  There are a lot of countries that have been for a long time in much worse shape than we have. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4727.98s)]
*  I'd really recommend people check out Gideon Lewis Krause and the New Yorker just had a huge piece on South Korea. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4732.98s)]
*  I think that's one of the ones I just can't. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4737.98s)]
*  He talks about this school that's got two kids in, I forget which grade, it's like two kids in one of the grades, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4742.98s)]
*  four in another. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4747.98s)]
*  And he talks about a feedback loop that has taken hold there where the fewer kids there are, the less people want kids around. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4752.98s)]
*  Kids are joyous and so annoying. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4757.98s)]
*  The more that society loses the memory, the values of reproduction, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4762.98s)]
*  the more it's like he talks about all these cafes that just say on the front, kids are not welcome. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4767.98s)]
*  And then as you, I was in Israel not long ago and in the West Bank, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4772.98s)]
*  I was in Morocco a couple years ago, and I'm always struck when I go to some of these places just how different it feels [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4777.98s)]
*  to be in a high fertility rate society, just how different every place is, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4782.98s)]
*  how different the assumptions of the place are, how different the Parents Act. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4787.98s)]
*  It's so much better. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4792.98s)]
*  I have seen estimates that to really make birth subsidies work it would have to be $300,000 per person, per birth. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4797.98s)]
*  I don't know that we are willing to do that at this country level. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4802.98s)]
*  I know people on the left who say, well, if we just had a big welfare state, if we had universal pre-K, [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4807.98s)]
*  if Sweden has all that, their total fertility rate is 1.1. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4812.98s)]
*  It's lower than ours. That doesn't do it. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4817.98s)]
*  A lot of the ideas on the right also don't do it. Hungary is not in a huge birth boom, right? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4822.98s)]
*  And they are doing things on the tax side. I don't know that we have a policy lever here. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4827.98s)]
*  I mean, I could come up with things. I would be very, very open to trying them. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4832.98s)]
*  I know so many people who don't have the family they want to have. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4837.98s)]
*  And there's just a million ways in which our society has been set up to culturally select against it. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4842.98s)]
*  The cost is too high, literally the cost. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4847.98s)]
*  But also, there's a very, very important concept of capstone versus cornerstones. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4852.98s)]
*  I think it's Brad Wilcox, but I could be wrong about that. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4857.98s)]
*  You did the capstones in a family were cornerstones of a life. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4862.98s)]
*  You did them first. And now they're capstones. People wait until everything else is settled. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4867.98s)]
*  Like, have I gotten all my education? Is my job figured out? Have I been able to afford a house? [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4872.98s)]
*  And then they will get married or have children as a capstone to that. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4877.98s)]
*  But often by the time they've gotten there, it's possibly too late or they can't have as many as they wanted. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4882.98s)]
*  I don't want to pretend I have policy solutions. I don't. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4887.98s)]
*  I would try lots of things and I do think we could do a lot of things in different directions. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4892.98s)]
*  But I also think this is a place where it's downstream of culture. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4897.98s)]
*  It's downstream of the work-life cycle. It's downstream of marriage rates in particular. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4902.98s)]
*  We know people are much likely to have kids in marriage. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4907.98s)]
*  It's poor women. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4912.98s)]
*  And men, by the way. A lot of men don't have the families they want either. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4917.98s)]
*  I think families become a thing inside liberal individualism. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4922.98s)]
*  I think people talk about families, talk about having kids. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4927.98s)]
*  I get it on AMAs for my show all the time. They talk about it as if you are trying to weigh a vacation. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4932.98s)]
*  It's more of everything. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4937.98s)]
*  One of the things that really bothers me about it is that I think it's not just my weekend. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4942.98s)]
*  My children's experience of the world is itself the gift, whatever mine is. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4947.98s)]
*  It doesn't mean I'm not happy about it. I have a delightful time with them. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4952.98s)]
*  And sometimes I do wish I could just sit around and read on the weekend. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4957.98s)]
*  I think it's the experience of the children. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4962.98s)]
*  I think it has been absorbed into this question of the experience of the adult. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4967.98s)]
*  And so it's like, will you be happier? Will you have more fun? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4972.98s)]
*  And then to everything Derek is saying, in a world where we've made it really unaffordable, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4977.98s)]
*  then it gets much harder and much worse. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4982.98s)]
*  This is not how we've done it. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=4987.98s)]
*  There are people who look at this and think, can we go back? [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5018.98s)]
*  And we're going to have to go forward into something. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5023.98s)]
*  I really believe that, but that requires a fluidity and experimental design and policy that we just have not created the structure for. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5028.98s)]
*  When we've made things stasis oriented and fixed, you can't try new structures at any kind of mass level. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5033.98s)]
*  So it's not going to work. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5038.98s)]
*  I think there could be a consensus around natalism in the sense of, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5043.98s)]
*  you guys are never going to be social conservatives. I'm obviously not going to be either. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5048.98s)]
*  But maybe there's some wisdom in bringing back the sacredness of the family. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5053.98s)]
*  I hate even using that language. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5058.98s)]
*  But the sense that, what you were just articulating in your way of there's something beyond your life [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5063.98s)]
*  that could be harder, but much more meaningful and therefore I would say arguably more valuable [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5068.98s)]
*  than getting to go see the Bob Dylan movie in a movie theater, which I really wanted to do and was never able to do. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5073.98s)]
*  And that language even- [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5078.98s)]
*  No parent will ever see The Brutalist. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5083.98s)]
*  Literally ever. I'm never seeing it. I will see that when I am 70 years old. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5088.98s)]
*  The language I feel is important and is something that feels very hard to do right now [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5093.98s)]
*  because the value has been on just choice. You do what you want. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5098.98s)]
*  And that is why when people call in for your AMAs, they're weighing it like a vacation because that is how we talk about it culturally, [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5103.98s)]
*  at least in our cohort. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5108.98s)]
*  To me, culture is a wave. Culture is not like technology and science where it goes up and to the left always, always. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5113.98s)]
*  It's a wave. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5118.98s)]
*  And we're in this period right now where we've had so many decades of this materialist individualism that I sense in the people that I read [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5123.98s)]
*  and even in the language they're using right now. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5128.98s)]
*  There's a hunger for spiritualism. There's a hunger for meaning. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5133.98s)]
*  There's a hunger for a sense of what life is about that I think is especially keen in a world with declining religiosity. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5138.98s)]
*  And I'll say for me, sometimes there's a cut, so to speak, between happiness and meaning, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5144.98s)]
*  but nowhere is that cut clearer in having a kid. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5149.98s)]
*  Being awake at 3 AM, three days in a row when your child is colicky and three weeks old, [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5154.98s)]
*  there's nothing happy about that. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5159.98s)]
*  If you listen to everything that Brian Johnson tells you to do with your body, you're doing all of the opposite things. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5164.98s)]
*  You're definitely not looking at your heart rate variability before you fall asleep. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5169.98s)]
*  Your entire life, in a way, from a biochemical standpoint, is falling the fuck apart. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5174.98s)]
*  And it's also the most amazing month of your life in some ways. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5179.98s)]
*  And I think that there is, I'll say what I felt, I don't want to speak for others and make it seem like I'm doing some religious soapbox thing. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5184.98s)]
*  One thing I felt was so fun about having a kid is that I've always thought of myself as a wire cutter guy. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5191.98s)]
*  Like if I'm ever going to buy headphones, I'll open up all the tabs to figure out. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5197.98s)]
*  You are the err wire cutter guy. I am married to the err wire cutter woman. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5202.98s)]
*  So it's just like if you're going to buy headphones, open up seven tabs, compare them. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5207.98s)]
*  If you're going to buy a couch, open up the seven tabs, compare them. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5212.98s)]
*  I'm just like always the do the deep data research before you make any expenditure. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5217.98s)]
*  I remember just having this really beautiful experience of feeling so instinctively certain about how to be a dad. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5222.98s)]
*  And thinking about it more, I remember just at 3.30 in the morning, thought if I'm honed to do anything other than procreate, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5229.98s)]
*  it's probably to be a dad for a little bit of time because how does the species survive if there's not only procreation, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5237.98s)]
*  but decent enough parenting that the infants survive? [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5243.98s)]
*  And I remember just having this experience that thousands and millions of years of genetic honing [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5248.98s)]
*  are alive in my cells right now, giving me incredibly wise instincts that I can act upon. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5253.98s)]
*  And all the ancestors are whispering through me to no, actually shift the baby from here to here. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5260.98s)]
*  And there's amazing little experiences like this that I have not found the equivalent depth of in any other activity. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5265.98s)]
*  It just only comes from the hard, painful, sometimes incredibly sucky experience of being a dad [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5271.98s)]
*  that feels like you have that depth of meaning. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5276.98s)]
*  So I hope that people who make political arguments like us are also not embarrassed about making emotional arguments [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5284.98s)]
*  for things like natalism because again, abundance is not just about the amount of money that you spend on things like that. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5294.98s)]
*  It's about sending more electrons across the country and erecting more drywall. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5300.98s)]
*  It's fundamentally about what's the good life and how do we build it? [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5305.98s)]
*  And I think kids are part of the good life, so they're part of the story too. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5310.98s)]
*  Derek, Ezra, are you ready for a lightning round? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5315.98s)]
*  Let's do it. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5320.98s)]
*  Ezra's told me how excited he is for running in 23... [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5325.98s)]
*  Exactly! [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5330.98s)]
*  Next question, will either of you ever run for office? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5335.98s)]
*  No. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5340.98s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5345.98s)]
*  Ooh, that's in a lightning round? [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5350.98s)]
*  The single best public policy book. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5355.98s)]
*  The single best public policy book of the last couple of years, the first one that comes to mind is Recoding America by Jen Polka. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5360.98s)]
*  Amazing book about the texture of why it's hard to get anything at all done in government. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5365.98s)]
*  The book that made me want to become a journalist was from Beirut to Jerusalem. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5370.98s)]
*  The book that I found most inspiring in high school when I absolutely decided to become a journalist was The Future of Freedom by Friedsacaria. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5375.98s)]
*  Favorite president in history? [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5384.98s)]
*  In history, I mean Lincoln if it's going to be in history. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5389.98s)]
*  I think objectively the answer is Lincoln. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5394.98s)]
*  So many callers. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5399.98s)]
*  Lost. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5404.98s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5409.98s)]
*  Disinhibited. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5414.98s)]
*  J.D. Vance. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5419.98s)]
*  Curdled. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5424.98s)]
*  She's given a hard brief. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5429.98s)]
*  I think that's a lot of good about them. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5459.98s)]
*  They seem like a wonderful, wonderful person. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5464.98s)]
*  It's a pathological character trait, not one I'm proud of. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5469.98s)]
*  I know this isn't lightning, but I need to ask it, what's one thing you've changed your mind about in the past five years? [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5474.98s)]
*  I mean, in this book, I think I've changed my mind about the cost of regulations. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5479.98s)]
*  I think I've changed my mind about the cost of regulations, and when I heard a story about them not working, I assumed it was an exception, and not look that closely into it. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5484.98s)]
*  And I now really try to treat that kind of thing as a signal for further investigation and try to then take very seriously what I find. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5489.98s)]
*  The value of religion. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5500.98s)]
*  I grew up thinking that not believing in God was a sign of intelligence, and the older I get, the more I find my own lack of belief, or feel my own lack of belief, to be a kind of psychological and emotional thing. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5505.98s)]
*  I think that's a very emotional deficit rather than a value. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5514.98s)]
*  Has the White Lotus fallen off this season? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5519.98s)]
*  Without question. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5524.98s)]
*  Thank God somebody's watching. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5529.98s)]
*  We're four hours into a cultural product in which nothing has happened. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5534.98s)]
*  I go under Reddit to find people who are as angrily passionate as I am about the degree to which White Lotus has fallen off, from certainly not an art direction standpoint, that cinematography is beautiful, but we're just in a period right now where prestige television has mastered cinematography and totally fallen off in terms of plot development. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5539.98s)]
*  And it's a problem. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5558.98s)]
*  What are you most excited about right now? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5563.98s)]
*  What are you most excited about? [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5568.98s)]
*  I want this all to be over so I have more time with my family and friends again. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5573.98s)]
*  I'm excited about being a normal person who isn't constantly talking. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5578.98s)]
*  The discovery of a plot in the White Lotus. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5583.98s)]
*  Derek, Ezra, their book is Abundance. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5588.98s)]
*  You can pick it up anywhere and I'm sure they will be on every single podcast, but I will speak for myself and say I've really loved talking to both of you. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5593.98s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5598.98s)]
*  It's been great. Thank you, Barry. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCE-kK4qCMk&t=5603.98s)]
