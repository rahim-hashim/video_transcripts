Last week marked a historic turning point in Syria. Rebel forces seized control of the nation, toppling the regime of Bashar al-Assad and ending his family’s brutal 50-year stranglehold on power.

For decades, the Assad dynasty ruled through unimaginable violence—launching chemical attacks on civilians, silencing dissent with mass imprisonment and torture, and presiding over a civil war that killed an estimated 600,000 people and drove 13 million into exile.

In cities across the world, jubilant Syrians have celebrated the regime’s downfall, having deemed it to be one of the world’s most oppressive dictatorships.

But not everyone is celebrating. Or at least, some people are saying there is reason for caution.

That’s because the coalition of rebel forces taking control of Syria now is led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, a militant Islamist organization which originated as an offshoot of al-Qaeda. Its leader is a Saudi-born Syrian who calls himself Abu Mohammad al-Jolani. A 21-year-old al-Jolani left Syria for Iraq in 2003 to join al-Qaeda and fight against America. There, he was captured by the U.S. and put into Bucca jail, which housed some of the most notorious al-Qaeda prisoners.

But since emerging on the world stage in the last week, al-Jolani has indicated that he is a reformed man, leading a moderated organization. He insists his al-Qaeda days and their methods—the detentions and torture and forced conversions—are over, and HTS is not going to persecute religious and ethnic minorities. But is it… true? 

Few people in the West might know that answer as well as journalist Theo Padnos. In October 2012, Padnos ventured from Turkey into Syria to report on the Syrian Civil War. There, he was captured by HTS (then known as Jabhat al-Nusra) and held captive for nearly two years. 

Throughout his captivity, Padnos endured relentless torture at the hands of his captors. He was savagely beaten until unconscious, given electric shocks, and forced into severe stress positions for hours at a time. All of this is to say nothing of the psychological torment inflicted on him.
Today, he joins Michael Moynihan to discuss his harrowing experience, the psychology of jihadists, and what the future of Syria will look like under the leadership of his former captors.

*  I need. Everything has been perfect. Food, clothing, even friends now. Thank you very much. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=74.88s)]

*  to live. Three days. If you don't do anything, I'm finished. I'm dead. They will kill me. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=100.72s)]

*  Theo Padnos, welcome to Honestly. Thank you very much for having me. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=137.2s)]
*  Theo, you were captive of Jabhat al-Nusra, a kind of, you know, al-Qaeda affiliate, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  and you were released in 2014. Pretty soon after you got back, I met up with you. That was 10 [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=148.88s)]
*  years ago. What is your life like now? I am the luckiest victim of this war, and there's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=155.84s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of them. And, you know, of course, many have been killed, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=162.56s)]
*  but many of the survivors of the torture and the detention on both sides of this civil war, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=168.56s)]
*  you know, they emerge and they have nothing. They almost have no place to go back to. The people [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=175.52s)]
*  who were, I was in prison with, you know, they, I don't think that they were well received. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=179.6s)]
*  Those few that got out, it was like, shut up, don't talk about this, go home, and we might need you [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=186.16s)]
*  in the army again. You were, I mean, it's the interesting thing now is that people are watching, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=192.8s)]
*  you know, I'm reluctant to call it the liberation of Syria, but I mean, getting rid of Bashar al-Assad [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=202.64s)]
*  is a liberation regardless of who does it, we'll see what happens. But the people who are doing the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=207.76s)]
*  liberating are the same people that held you captive. The same individuals. I mean, I see them [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=212.16s)]
*  on video. I go, oh, that's Abu Hamza. There he is. What are you doing there? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=218.56s)]
*  You've actually seen on video people in Damascus who are now in control of Syria that held you and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=222.08s)]
*  tortured you. Yes. Yes. I mean, the victory, the people who are in charge of the nation right now, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=229.52s)]
*  you know, when I knew them, they were terrorists and sadists. And now they're, they like, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=238.96s)]
*  you know, they've rebranded. And I think that, you know, in a way, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=245.68s)]
*  what we want is a monopoly of force. We want peace. We want the most possible peace as soon as [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=251.04s)]
*  possible for the most people. And so in order to accomplish that, you have to have a monopoly of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=255.44s)]
*  force. And for a while I thought, give it to, you know, give it to whoever is the most likely to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=259.44s)]
*  have it. Right now it's al-Qaeda torturers. And they're being relatively, they're comporting [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=265.04s)]
*  themselves, you know, like relatively decently at the moment. But could they, I mean, you've seen [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=270.48s)]
*  this, you know, their psychology very well. I mean, you spent two and a half years. Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=276.88s)]
*  Right. And they're taking prisoners now, as we can see across Twitter on video. They take the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=281.68s)]
*  enemies of God and they put them in jail and most of them they're going to kill because they believe [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=287.68s)]
*  a lot of the enemies are like beyond redemption. But there's some they think like me, they were [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  like, he's not so far gone that we can't redeem him. But in order to redeem that person, it's like [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=296.72s)]
*  they put you- Why were you not so far gone? Because it's Pukar Abuk? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  Because their true enemies are the Alawites and the Shia. And those people are like beyond the pale. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  And they figure that I could possibly, like they didn't know what kind of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=312.24s)]
*  sins I had committed in the past. My sin was being an American. It was like, you know, I had, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  they felt that I was like a libertine that had gone around sleeping with women all the time. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  And also I was selfish. I wanted money. Why did you come to Syria? For journalism. Why do you [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=326.72s)]
*  want to do journalism? You wanted money. You want to advance yourself. You were like self-involved [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  and self-interested. Well, you know, in a way it was true. Like I was, I was dreaming of getting [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=335.6s)]
*  a commission for 200 bucks, you know, but they were like, you're greedy. Why can't you sacrifice [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=340.08000000000004s)]
*  yourself for the people like we're doing? Let's go back to that to explain to people [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=345.76000000000005s)]
*  how you got in that situation in the first place. You're on the border of Turkey, trying to get into [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=350.72s)]
*  Syria at the pretty much at the beginning of the civil war when we consider that it's been going [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=356.56s)]
*  on since 2011 and you get across the border. Tell me what happens when you get into Syria. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=360.72s)]
*  I mean, right away I met some people in Turkey and on talk to you Turkey and they said, listen, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=367.84s)]
*  we are fixtures for journalists and we ourselves are journalists, which was kind of true. They [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=372.4s)]
*  were journalists for Jebat al-Nusra. They were like doing the promotion, the self-promotion for [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=376.4s)]
*  Jebat al-Nusra. And they took a lot of photographs and I eventually made friends with these guys on [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=380.8s)]
*  Facebook and I saw all their journalistic work, which is, you know, it is a kind of journalism [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=384.08s)]
*  they're doing. But did you know their affiliation? No, they were like, they did not say, by the way, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=389.44s)]
*  we're from Tanzim al-Qaeda. That's what they call it, the al-Qaeda system. But when we crossed the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  border, we slept the first night in like an abandoned house. We woke up the next morning [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=400.96s)]
*  and we drove to another abandoned house and they set up a sort of a scenario roughly like this. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=405.68s)]
*  Cameras and? Cameras and microphone and they're like, let's do an interview. And in the midst of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=412.0s)]
*  this interview, they came over and kind of jumped on me and started kicking me and then they put a [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=416.4s)]
*  gun in my face. And during that assault, they handcuffed my hands by my back. And I kind of woke [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=422.56s)]
*  up and I was when I went like a moment later, when I regained consciousness, my face was covered in [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=428.32s)]
*  blood and a guy was pointing a gun at me and he goes, you're our prisoner now. And the meaning, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=433.44s)]
*  you're our prisoner. And they took my iPhone out of my pocket and they go, this is Hanayim, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=439.44s)]
*  that's war booty. And they said, you know, we are, we belong to the al-Qaeda organization [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=444.64s)]
*  and you killed our sheikh, Osama bin Laden. And furthermore, you, you people are imperialists. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=450.24s)]
*  So you're beaten, hooded, shackled? Not right away. Not right away. Because these guys were [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=457.2s)]
*  amateurs. What happened is these people were amateurs and they pretended to belong to the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=463.68s)]
*  al-Qaeda organization, which was the only like terrorist faction in Syria at the time. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=469.12s)]
*  But they were just like amateur hoodlums, wannabe fanboys of ISIS al-Qaeda. So during the night, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=474.32s)]
*  that first night I slept in the same bed with a guy. He handcuffed me like the chief kidnapper [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=480.24s)]
*  to his wrist. And in the morning, you know, when they wake up for the Salat al-Fajr, which is the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=484.8s)]
*  dawn prayer, I go, Hey man, this handcuff is like a little tight on my wrist. Can you just loosen it [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=489.44s)]
*  up? He goes, no problem. He loosened it up a little bit, went back to sleep. And as he was sleeping, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=494.0s)]
*  I pulled my hand out of the handcuff and then I was free. But I was lying next to this terrorist [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=500.32s)]
*  and there was a terrorist in the other room and they all had guns. So I stood up and I walked [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=505.44s)]
*  very carefully to the door, opened the door, and then I ran out into the street like a madman. I [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=510.4s)]
*  had never been so frightened in my life. Did you know where you were? I had no idea where I was. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=516.88s)]
*  I was in the midst of a town called Marat Mersirin, it turns out. I went straight to the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=520.56s)]
*  local police force. I said, bring me to the Jaisal Haad, that's the Free Syrian Army. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=524.72s)]
*  Allegedly, they were on our side. So I said, please, you know, help me save me. I've been [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=528.72s)]
*  kidnapped by these horrible Al Qaeda people. And for people to give them context, and if they [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=532.88s)]
*  remember this, the Free Syrian Army, which was promoted by people like John McCain and, you know, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=538.72s)]
*  people going to visit and said, this is not necessarily a secular army, but these are the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=544.08s)]
*  good guys. That's right. And we had a thing called Operation Timber Sycamore at the time. We were [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=548.32s)]
*  pouring millions and millions of dollars into their pockets. So theoretically, they ought to [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=553.12s)]
*  have been on our side. Yeah. But anyway, I arrived at this police station. They said, oh, great, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=557.0400000000001s)]
*  thank you for coming. Have a cup of tea. Nice to see you. We're going to just have a little [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=562.24s)]
*  discussion and figure out who you really are. And then they went out and found the kidnappers [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=566.4000000000001s)]
*  and the kidnappers said, he's a spy. He's an American. Well, you know, look how he speaks [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=570.56s)]
*  Arabic. You know, during the arrest, they had beaten me. So speaking Arabic that well [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=575.1999999999999s)]
*  worked against you. It's like, how could a guy speak Arabic like this without having been trained [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=581.76s)]
*  by the CIA? I'm like, I spent my stupid, every last bit of pocket change I have to study this [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=585.8399999999999s)]
*  damn language. And so they delivered you back to the kidnappers. And then we went to the court. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=592.56s)]
*  Yeah, we went to the Islamic court, the Shari'i. And they call Mahkama Shari'i. That's the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  court of the law of God. And this guy interviewed the kidnappers. In an Islamic court, you have [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=605.28s)]
*  two witnesses for the prosecution. And those were my kidnappers. There was no lawyer. And the two [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=611.1999999999999s)]
*  witnesses testified against me that I was indeed a spy. They just talked to the judge for like 40 [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=616.16s)]
*  minutes. And being an idiot like I am, I told the judge, the judge came into a room with all the [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=619.52s)]
*  free Syrian army guys. He goes, you're going to have to provide me with a translator. He said that to [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=627.2s)]
*  the guys. I go, don't worry, judge. I speak Arabic. No problem. I don't need a translator. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=631.36s)]
*  It was like a capital crime. I was being, you know, I was being tried basically for spying. I [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=636.96s)]
*  didn't know this. Well, the right thing to do when you're being like tried for a capital crime thing [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=642.16s)]
*  that they could kill you for is to delay stall. Just don't let it happen. But I'm like, no, he's [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=648.08s)]
*  going to talk to him. He's going to see that I'm medicine. He's going to be reasonable. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=652.64s)]
*  He also recorded me on video like this. They record everything they do on video. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=656.32s)]
*  And he's like, ask me a few questions. I told him I had been in Yemen studying Arabic and studying [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=661.52s)]
*  Islam. He's like, spy, spy, spy. And it took, you know, my testimony was like five minutes. And then [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=666.96s)]
*  he called the soldier. He goes, put him in the basement. They brought me down into a toilet in [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=672.48s)]
*  the basement. And they locked the door. It was like, you know, about the size of this chair. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=676.88s)]
*  Couldn't lie down in it. There was poop all over the place. And I'm like, hmm, this doesn't feel [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=682.64s)]
*  good. And I poked my head out of the little food hatch. And there was a guy in a cell next to me. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=689.4399999999999s)]
*  And I go, man, what did you do? Like, what's your crime? He goes, no, she we're we're Shia. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=695.1999999999999s)]
*  So I'm like, this seems like a religious sort of organization. And within the next minutes, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=702.4s)]
*  I was in the hands of Mohammed Adnani, who was the author of the Bataklan attacks. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=707.92s)]
*  In Paris. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=713.12s)]
*  In Paris. And the guy who burned to death the Jordanian pilot was Kasasby. His headquarters [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=713.92s)]
*  were in the nearby town there. And he took me to, you know, his he took me to to really that kind [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=719.8399999999999s)]
*  of the cradle, the birth of the Islamic State, a little farmhouse. There was a bunch of Iraqi guys, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=727.36s)]
*  a bunch of French guys there. And for me, that's when the real torture began. Like the torture [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=731.8399999999999s)]
*  today was not it was not Nizami is this not systematic. But once they you get in the hands [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=736.0s)]
*  of the actual Al Qaeda men, they know how to do it properly. At first, I was so ashamed of what they [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=742.56s)]
*  had done to me that I was like, I can I can never tell anybody this. I I tried to hang myself. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=747.84s)]
*  This is another thing I was very ashamed of. Like they put me in such like a psychological condition. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=754.48s)]
*  You tried to hang yourself in captivity. Yeah, I was very I was like, I don't want to do this, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=758.48s)]
*  but I have to. Yeah. And and even and after that, I was ashamed about this. It's like part of what [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=762.1600000000001s)]
*  happens in these prisons and how it happens in the government prisons, too, is they they degrade you [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=767.2800000000001s)]
*  to the status of an animal. And I want a cub and the wassack. You know, you are you are dirt, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=772.32s)]
*  you are filth, you are life that doesn't deserve to live. You know, and anyway, eventually, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=777.76s)]
*  I'll tell you about the torture, the torture. It's like if you knew that it was going to be 10 [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=785.0400000000001s)]
*  minutes, 20 minutes and that you're going to come out alive, you'd be like, OK, no problem, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=790.0s)]
*  I'll deal with it. Yeah. But you don't know this. And once they take you, they put you through it [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=793.2s)]
*  once and then they bring you back to the cell and they go tomorrow. It's going to be worse because [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=797.28s)]
*  you lied to us. They're looking for answers you describe in your book. And I've talked to you about [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=800.8s)]
*  it in the past is they're looking for a very specific answer and they'll beat you until they [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=806.32s)]
*  get it. So is the purpose just sadism? No, because because if they're looking, you can say no, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=814.0s)]
*  no, no. And then when you say, yes, I'm a spy, they don't they couldn't possibly believe that. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=822.56s)]
*  Yeah, of course they can. They do. Yes. You think so? Yes. Yeah. I don't think that all the [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=827.04s)]
*  journalists who are wandering around Syria at the moment. I mean, I suspect that the higher ups and [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=832.08s)]
*  I know that the higher ups and Jebatin, which is now Hayat Tahrir, they are certain that all those [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=837.04s)]
*  people are reporting back to the CIA. They don't care. They're like, fine, you know, we have a we [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=842.56s)]
*  have a decent system. Our intentions are good to tell the CIA whatever you want to whatever you [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=847.5999999999999s)]
*  want to tell them. But yeah, I mean, they they are speaking when they speak to the journalist, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=851.52s)]
*  they go, you know, please in their minds, they're saying and relay all this to your paymasters at [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=857.1199999999999s)]
*  the CIA, you Jew. You know, that that's what they're thinking. But they're not saying that [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=861.76s)]
*  you are Jewish, right? I have a Jewish father, but I was not raised as a Jew. But [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=866.56s)]
*  no one knew that when you're in captivity, right? No. And they had no. But my cellmate, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=872.7199999999999s)]
*  I had a cellmate for a little while, a guy called Shrier, who was American, who was American, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=878.7199999999999s)]
*  who himself was a Jew. I didn't know this at the time, but we all have secrets, you know, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=884.7199999999999s)]
*  a lot of stuff you don't want to tell these guys, because you don't know how they're going to react. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=888.88s)]
*  And in fact, they have a paper trail. That's right. These guys were halfway clever and not [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=892.8s)]
*  just sadistic. They could get on Google and probably figure this out. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=899.28s)]
*  Of course. The worst thing that I did was I wrote a book called Undercover Muslim. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=902.72s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, in fact, Adnan, he did discover this. He came into my cell at one point [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=906.3199999999999s)]
*  and he said, we know what you we know you've written a book. He goes, what was the title of [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=911.8399999999999s)]
*  your stupid book, you idiot? I'm like, gee, I forget. You know, and I told him a lie. I could [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=916.16s)]
*  not utter those words. It's called Undercover Muslim. But he said to his friends who were there, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=922.48s)]
*  he said, he's been spying on our brothers in Yemen. And I'm like, I guess that's the end. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=926.88s)]
*  They know everything. Do you get defiant at a certain point where I mean, there's so many [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=932.32s)]
*  times that you've recounted in your book and the conversation we had when you were released, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=938.16s)]
*  that they said, take a look at the sun. This is the last time you're going to see it. Yeah. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=943.76s)]
*  Last time you're going to ever see this. And that's pretty convincing when these ISIS al-Qaeda [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=947.52s)]
*  guys there. I mean, do you get defiant in the sense that what do I have to lose at this point? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=952.0s)]
*  The reason why I wanted to talk about the suicide is not because it was an expression of my despair. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=956.72s)]
*  Well, it wasn't an expression of my despair. I think it's a systematic thing they do to everybody. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=960.88s)]
*  They want everybody to give up on the life that you're living now. Completely die to your past [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=966.96s)]
*  and to your names. They give you like a new name. And for the first like year and a half, I was dirt. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=971.84s)]
*  I was filth. That was the name? Yeah. In Arabic? In Arabic. Haywan, wassakh, kalb. But eventually, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=977.6s)]
*  so you die to your past in order for you to reawaken someday with an orientation as they [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=986.72s)]
*  are oriented. All the hostages converted without exception. Did you? And I never did convert [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=993.84s)]
*  because- You didn't even fake a conversion. I did not fake a conversion, nothing. Because [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1000.48s)]
*  I felt that my, if they had a gun to my head and they said, if you are going to, we will spare you, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1005.76s)]
*  but you have to convert, I would have done it. But they never came to that. At first, as I say, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1012.8000000000001s)]
*  I was very ashamed of what they were doing to me at the condition to which they reduced me. I blame [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1017.76s)]
*  myself for having gone to Syria in the first place. What was I thinking? I wasn't a success [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1022.4000000000001s)]
*  in the journalism world by any means. And I imagined that I was going to go in there and [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1028.56s)]
*  start sending pictures out to editors. And then I was going to, that was stupid. And I tossed my [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1032.24s)]
*  life away for that stupid fantasy. And I was angry at myself. But then they kept [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1037.44s)]
*  abasing me. And after six months, I hadn't changed my underwear in six months, no brushing your teeth, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1042.96s)]
*  like my clothes were full of lice. I was just filthy. And I was ashamed. And then when the [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1049.8400000000001s)]
*  torture is, it's like sexual abuse in the sense in that you go into a dark place. There's all these [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1058.0800000000002s)]
*  men, you don't really, you know, maybe they are enjoying it to some extent. And they kind of know [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1062.88s)]
*  it's wrong too. And they have, yeah, because there's nothing in Islam that says torture that guy. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1069.2s)]
*  Yeah. But how do you, how do you, what made you think that? Was there any indications of that? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1075.0400000000002s)]
*  Because the next morning when they come to see you, they're a little bit sheepish. They're like, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1079.68s)]
*  we did that to you. You know, they see the blood, they see the bruises and they go, wow, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1082.64s)]
*  what happened? Like they didn't really, they didn't understand why they were doing [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1086.16s)]
*  what they had done. And, you know, when I, when I would see them, like our relationships after the [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1090.64s)]
*  torture, it would improve. And then I would sometimes remind them like they were all in masks [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1097.2s)]
*  and I was in a blindfold. So when they, which is the name of your book. Yeah. When, when they [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1102.72s)]
*  were doing this torture, theoretically, I didn't know which dudes they were, but I did. Of course. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1107.5200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. So, so, you know, a week or two later, I go, I know that you were in there, dude. Yeah. I know [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1111.1200000000001s)]
*  who you are. And they were sheepish and embarrassed. Like, yeah, yeah, I did it. And they were masked the [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1115.6000000000001s)]
*  whole time. Always. I know. Yeah. But, but like some of the guys that were trying to have a good [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1118.88s)]
*  relationship with me, they would bring me food every day. Those guys during the torture, they [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1125.7600000000002s)]
*  would be masked. But when they brought me food, they're like, Hey friend, how you doing? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1131.6000000000001s)]
*  So thinking that you didn't thinking I didn't know, but I didn't know. And I would remind them [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1135.44s)]
*  and they'd be like, Oh, well, oh, well. Anyway, this, this, the thing you asked me, like, what, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1138.96s)]
*  what am I, what is the darkest place? And at the time I was like, I can never tell anybody [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1143.68s)]
*  that the shameful thing happened to me, that they brought me to this abject condition that I, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1148.32s)]
*  I submitted myself. It was just the condition in general, the whole thing. It was the, it was the [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1153.1200000000001s)]
*  psychological abasement. Yeah. I was so in their power. I was so at their feet. I was so like, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1158.08s)]
*  anything you do, I will, anything you want from me, I will give it to you. I lied so, so much to them. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1165.04s)]
*  You know, I betrayed myself so deeply. How so? By telling them everything that they wanted to hear, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1170.72s)]
*  by acting, you know, lying about I'm a CIA agent. Did you kill Anwar Aulaki? Of course. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1176.88s)]
*  Anwar Aulaki was a American preacher who, who was bombed, drone to death by the CIA. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1184.4s)]
*  His son too. And his son as well. So this is something I confess to. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1191.1200000000001s)]
*  They have to have known that this is absolutely absurdity, that you were part of the responsible [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1196.16s)]
*  for that. Part of the challenge, part of what they're trying to create is like a belief force [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1201.3600000000001s)]
*  field. It's like belief that is so intense that you cannot deny it. And when you are down in the [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1205.92s)]
*  torture room, it's dark, there are candles on the floor. There's men covered in guns and grenades [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1210.64s)]
*  all around you. It's a, it's like a community experience. They bring the little kids down there. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1216.0800000000002s)]
*  And they bring little kids into the torture. Of course, the little kids participate in the torture. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1220.8000000000002s)]
*  You were tortured by children too. They held the little, they had little like child-sized cables [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1224.96s)]
*  and the chief torturer says to the kids- Cables meaning they were hooked up to a car battery. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1230.0s)]
*  Sometimes yes, but also they have like galvanized steel cables, the kind of thing that like a highway [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1234.4s)]
*  guardrail, they, they take these things, they cut off the, they, they cut them into like four foot [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1238.96s)]
*  lengths and then they barb up the end. So when they hit you, like the shaft of the cable will [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1243.8400000000001s)]
*  wrap around your body and the barbs will sink into the flesh like that and rip it out and go like that [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1248.8000000000002s)]
*  a bunch of times. Whack, whack, sorry. Children, children participate for a reason, I believe. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1253.8400000000001s)]
*  The reason is that when they say to the kid, like, this is an enemy of God, you're hanging [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1260.72s)]
*  from a fucking pipe by your handcuffs. And they go, this is an enemy. You see what he did? You see [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1268.4s)]
*  what this filth is? You see, do you want to be like that? No, you don't want to be like that. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1273.92s)]
*  Do you want to punish him? Do you want to show us that you hate this kind of wickedness, this [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1278.96s)]
*  sinfulness? Show us. Kids like, I don't really want to do it. And they go, go. Well, if you do [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1283.12s)]
*  that to a kid long enough over time, that's going to change the psychology of the kid. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1287.92s)]
*  That's why those kids are dangerous. You know, that's why they have an entire generation of [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1292.88s)]
*  young people that they are, that have been, you know, learning this. They were six years old in [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1296.96s)]
*  2011. Yeah, that's right. That's right. But they have tons of six year olds now too, to bring along [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1302.72s)]
*  in this fashion. And believe me, you go and ask the people in charge in Damascus, like, what are [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1309.76s)]
*  you doing to the kids? They're going to say, oh, we teach them the math and the science. Yeah. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1315.28s)]
*  STEM. We know that torture exists and has existed throughout humanity and adults do it. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1320.48s)]
*  I just don't have any frame of reference for children to do it. So it must be a pretty [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1327.36s)]
*  surprising thing when you see that. It's shocking. It's terrifying. But I was assuming that the reason [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1330.8799999999999s)]
*  why they're letting me see this is because they know that they know I'll never come out alive. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1336.32s)]
*  So this is, I'm being explicit about this, because I think it's important that we understand who these [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1341.36s)]
*  people, like this is who they are. They're doing this every day for years and years and years. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1347.1999999999998s)]
*  And what do we see on the news? Like how awful the Assad regime is? Well, the Assad regime does this [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1352.9599999999998s)]
*  too, by the way. But it's not like these guys are any better. I believe that they really want to [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1357.12s)]
*  cause a psychological death to all their prisoners so that when you wake up, you are more like in [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1362.32s)]
*  harmony with their way of seeing things. This is their dream for Syria. It's like they're not [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1367.76s)]
*  saying this, but it really is the case that everybody will orient themselves in terms of [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1372.24s)]
*  where is Mecca? This is the thing that you submit to. And who are the secular leaders around, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1379.68s)]
*  or the temporal leaders around here? That's Abu Muhammad Jalani. That's the guy you submit to. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1385.28s)]
*  And you don't ask yourself what's right and wrong. You ask him, because he's in touch with the [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1390.4s)]
*  learned man. And he's in touch with the deepest scholarship of the Quran and the history of Islam. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1397.5200000000002s)]
*  So he knows what's right and wrong. You submit to that. And they would like to do this for the [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1402.8000000000002s)]
*  Bilad Hasham, which is the Levant. When I was there, it was called Tazim al-Qaeda v. Bilad Hasham. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1407.68s)]
*  That's the al-Qaeda system in the Levant. The Levant includes Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1413.3600000000001s)]
*  Provided all those people submit to the Sharia, they're not going to kill them. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1421.84s)]
*  That's the dream. But you didn't submit, and they didn't kill you. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1426.1599999999999s)]
*  I did submit. You did? Of course I did. I didn't submit by saying la ilaha ilallah. There is no [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1430.24s)]
*  God but God. But I acknowledged them as the supreme leaders, which they were. The supreme power. It was [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1435.68s)]
*  like this dark, inscrutable, all-powerful power that can take your life in an instant. And you [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1441.28s)]
*  submit to that. And if you don't, you're in trouble. Is it so deranging in the sense that you're in a [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1446.48s)]
*  dark cell and you don't know when you're going to be pulled out and tortured and beaten, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1451.1200000000001s)]
*  and you don't know when, if ever, or how it will end, that you start kind of thinking of these things [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1454.96s)]
*  the way that they want you to think about them? Because it's the only kind of reference that you [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1463.1200000000001s)]
*  have to anything. What you think is that I am in the... You think, according to proper Islamic [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1467.0400000000002s)]
*  orthodoxy, in that you are in the hands of an inscrutable power that you cannot speak to. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1474.08s)]
*  You can only submit to it. You can make prayers to it. And if you bring yourself into harmony with [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1479.36s)]
*  Islam, God might well listen to you, only under those conditions. But the idea is a deep psychological [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1486.1599999999999s)]
*  submission to their authority. And I did that. I was to the point where I wanted their approval. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1492.96s)]
*  I wanted their affection. I wanted... Because they were giving me food. If I didn't get the affection, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1503.44s)]
*  I didn't get food. I needed to go to the bathroom. I couldn't go to the bathroom without their [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1507.52s)]
*  permission. Sleep, I needed that. Was any of that real? Did you develop any affection in some kind [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1511.8400000000001s)]
*  of twisted way that because that's the only affection you can develop in a situation like that? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1518.24s)]
*  Not really. A lot of these young men... You could just say, did you like any of them at any point? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1524.4s)]
*  Yes. I continue to be in touch with them and I continue to like them. I appreciate them, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1529.2s)]
*  but they are... Today, you mean? Of course. No, hold on. Of course. You talk to... I talk to [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1534.56s)]
*  these people because... The ones that tortured you and imprisoned you. The guys who actually... A lot [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1541.12s)]
*  of those people have been killed, but due to a standing over there, for instance. Yes, I do [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1545.6s)]
*  talk to those people. I'm interested and concerned and I want to know what's next. You're concerned. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1551.84s)]
*  What do you mean you're concerned? I want to know what they're planning. By the way, this jihad... [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1556.8s)]
*  In an interest in them personally or just in a journalistic way? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1562.48s)]
*  Both. Okay, both. It's a phenomenon. It's a fascinating phenomenon that the outside world [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1565.76s)]
*  does not understand. I have the sincerest belief that the October 7th attacks, I know how those [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1571.9199999999998s)]
*  things were produced. I don't think... Because I've been through that process myself, the process of [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1577.52s)]
*  dying to yourself and then reawakening to another person, another being. You are transformed in a [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1581.6s)]
*  deep psychological way and you are under their power. Now, we believe that when some mujahid, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1589.6799999999998s)]
*  some chief sheikh comes along to a bunch of young Muslims and says, hey, everybody, tomorrow you're [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1598.08s)]
*  going to jump over the wall and kill a bunch of Israelis and they're going to kill you and it's [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1603.76s)]
*  going to be great and you're going to see the virgins and off you go. They won't do it. If you [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1607.12s)]
*  take 25 kids off the street or 1500 kids off the street, which is kind of what happened on the [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1612.0s)]
*  October 7th attacks and say, hey, everybody, tomorrow the virgins, great, off you go, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1617.1999999999998s)]
*  is not going to happen. It's a much deeper, longer, prolonged and authentic process of [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1622.2399999999998s)]
*  psychological transformation that the outside world knows nothing about. Believe me, I want to [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1629.12s)]
*  explain this. When you hear there's a call that was captured by Shin Betr Massad on the day [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1635.04s)]
*  and it was played at infinite and we saw it everywhere, heard it everywhere, a guy calling [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1644.3999999999999s)]
*  his family saying, I killed Jews today. Aren't you proud of me, dad? That makes a certain amount of [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1649.04s)]
*  sense to you that it wouldn't make to other people, right? In the sense that you understand [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1655.44s)]
*  how people get to that point, it's not just you're going to have some virgins go. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1660.48s)]
*  The dangerous thing is it's like not the weapons because the weapons they have are oftentimes like [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1666.48s)]
*  Kalashnikovs that have been passed together with bubble gums and it's not even the number of people [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1674.0s)]
*  because it's often not very many of them, but it's the fact that they have been psychologically [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1678.6399999999999s)]
*  transformed. You can't see it. You don't know who is who and they themselves are good at dissembling [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1684.48s)]
*  this is part of what you learn. It is a cult. Every cult member has a double personality. You [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1689.92s)]
*  have a cult for inside the cult and a self for outside the cult and they know how to code switch. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1695.76s)]
*  At the moment, I believe that the top people in the cult are all code switching. They're all saying, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1701.2s)]
*  we know how to deal with the public and they're doing it perfectly and I feel that the whole [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1706.48s)]
*  world is like, yay, it's all good. Is everyone that you have kept in touch with, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1711.04s)]
*  who were your captors and torturers? Are they all still in the cult? Did anyone? Yeah. No one has [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1716.96s)]
*  apologized. No, they said this was some of them defected to ISIS like the guys I talked to [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1722.56s)]
*  this morning. They were this morning. Yeah, I don't have this is a regular thing for you. They call [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1727.1999999999998s)]
*  me a lot. They call you on the phone like on WhatsApp. They're lonely. They're lonely. They're [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1732.8799999999999s)]
*  lonely young men. A lot of you. Why do you do this though? I mean, isn't it? Isn't it? I mean, it's [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1737.6s)]
*  like you understand how it's a kind of a weird thing. I guess people do think it's weird. They [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1743.04s)]
*  go, you have Stockholm syndrome. You're fucked up with the fuck's your problem. You know, for [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1747.76s)]
*  a long, for the past 10 years, Jabhat al-Nusra has been like yesterday's news. Nobody was talking [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1751.92s)]
*  about them. Yeah. But I knew that something was going to happen. I mean, I knew because I know [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1758.3999999999999s)]
*  them and I know how they operate. And so I don't believe this transformation that they're that they [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1762.8799999999999s)]
*  want. I believe that they want a like peace in Syria for their own people, but not for Christians [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1769.28s)]
*  and Alawites and Kurds. The Alawites are beyond the pale. They're never going to forgive the [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1776.32s)]
*  Alawites. The Christians, they have a legitimate place in Islam. You have to pay the tax. You have [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1781.76s)]
*  to do what they say and they're going to leave you alone. But apparently there were 300,000 [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1786.96s)]
*  Christians in Aleppo before all of this and 30,000 remain. So those Christians are not taking [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1791.6s)]
*  the word of God or Jabhat al-Nusra or Hayat al-Hirasham at face value. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1798.56s)]
*  So when you talk to somebody this morning who is a member of this group and you know, whether they [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1804.8799999999999s)]
*  were at Jabhat al-Nusra or ISIS or something, what is that conversation? Like what are you [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1811.28s)]
*  talking about? Rahman, how are you doing? What's going on? Really? Yeah. I miss you. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1815.6s)]
*  Really? Yeah. They say I miss you. That's kind of, that's what one says in Arabic. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1820.3999999999999s)]
*  It's not ironic or anything. I miss you. I mean, sorry, that's- You don't miss them. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1824.4s)]
*  I don't really miss them, but listen, these people, in a way, sometimes they were good to me [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1829.52s)]
*  and I was grateful to them for this. Especially the guys I talked to. Like, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1834.0s)]
*  I was starving and they brought me food. But no one's apologized. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1837.92s)]
*  Isn't that, they don't feel that they didn't, they did anything bad. Yeah, no, that's what I assume. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1841.6s)]
*  Yeah. So there's no apology and they don't, they don't think that this was- I'm sure if I went now [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1845.68s)]
*  and I talked to Jolani, he would go, listen, I didn't have anything to do with it. However, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1850.0s)]
*  I apologize on behalf of our organization. We're awfully sorry. You know? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1853.84s)]
*  Apparently, he wants to requisition or have all the torturers from the regime who have escaped [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1861.36s)]
*  the country. He wants to have them- Repatriated. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1867.84s)]
*  Repatriated and brought to trial. But I want to have him expatriated and brought to trial. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1870.88s)]
*  But the guys that you talked to and the guys that you developed some relationship with, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1876.08s)]
*  would you want to see them on trial too? I mean, listen, what I want is peace and [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1879.76s)]
*  security and stability for Syria. Yeah, but could you have that and also want them to [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1884.32s)]
*  be in front of a judge? They inflict crimes that are far greater than anything they did to me [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1889.12s)]
*  against the people of Syria. One question you'll never have asked by all the journalists that are [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1896.8799999999999s)]
*  interviewing Jolani today is, what did you do with all those people that are in your prisons? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1900.7199999999998s)]
*  Most of them were killed. Why were they killed? Because of tiny little differences in the way [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1905.52s)]
*  that they make the prayer. Like this guy makes the prayer, he says the liturgy is slightly [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1910.16s)]
*  different way from the way most people do it. And they kill them for that. So, you know, I think [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1916.0800000000002s)]
*  he needs to be held accountable for the crimes he's committed against the people of Syria. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1922.3200000000002s)]
*  You had a number of cellmates over your time. How many of those people survived? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1926.72s)]
*  Very few. It's like they disappeared. You wake up one morning and they were gone. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1931.36s)]
*  Yes, that happened. But at a certain point, I was in a prison in Aleppo with about maybe 20 officers [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1936.9599999999998s)]
*  from the Syrian Arab Army and have been in contact with their families. And some of those people, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1944.3999999999999s)]
*  of those 20, like four emerged alive and the rest, they just disappeared. So perhaps they are living [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1949.76s)]
*  somewhere within the Jebat al-Tanusra control. But one question you'll never hear the journalists ask [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1955.52s)]
*  of the people who are in charge of Syria now is what became of your own prisoners? What did you [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1961.1200000000001s)]
*  do with them? And why did you do it? The reason they did it is because they're trying to bring [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1965.0400000000002s)]
*  Syria into harmony with God. And the Alawites interfere, they pollute, they disturb, and they [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1971.6000000000001s)]
*  just make that they are impudies. Christians have a place on that, but Alawites and Shia, no. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1978.0800000000002s)]
*  Definitely not. Definitely not. But there's no way so we can expect despite what they say [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1984.64s)]
*  that the small Shia population will be pushed out entirely or killed or whatever. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1990.24s)]
*  Like in theory, anybody, it doesn't matter the religion, it's just that everybody will say, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=1996.16s)]
*  anybody can convert to Islam, even an Alawite, even a Jew, anybody can convert to Sunni Islam. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2003.2s)]
*  So in theory, yes. But they believe that the Alawites, for instance, are so deceptive. And so [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2009.36s)]
*  their souls are so corrupt that they will say they've converted and they'll pretend to be Muslims, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2016.56s)]
*  but really they aren't. And if you let them into your community, they are spies and pollutants, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2022.0s)]
*  and they will betray you to the enemies of God, which are Israel and America. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2028.0s)]
*  So they have to be exterminated because they can't be trusted. That's really the issue. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2033.84s)]
*  It's the amazing thing that you survived for a number of reasons, but to point something out, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2038.96s)]
*  you escaped and were caught twice. Tell me about the second time. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2044.96s)]
*  The second time, this goes to show the extent of the psychological control they have over the [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2050.48s)]
*  landscape, like the populace in general, because I did, in fact, I went to what I thought would be [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2056.64s)]
*  like a civilian administered hospital the second time. And I said to them, listen, I've been with [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2061.44s)]
*  you know, some extremists who came in from the eastern part of Syria, where ISIS was at the time. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2069.76s)]
*  And, you know, the people at the hospital knew what I was talking about. And they said, oh, sure, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2076.2400000000002s)]
*  no problem. We'll send you back. I told them, listen, I'm an Irish journalist. They like Irishmen. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2081.36s)]
*  And I'm from the BBC. And they said, no problem. Okay, you can call up your BBC guys. We just [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2085.92s)]
*  gonna need to get your phone. We'll find a phone for you and you can call them up. The guy stepped [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2091.28s)]
*  out of the room and he went to call the people I had escaped from, namely, Jabhat al-Nusra, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2096.08s)]
*  and called up those people and said, hey, the American that you're looking for is down here [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2101.7599999999998s)]
*  at the hospital. Come pick him up. What is the benefit for them? Do they, there's not like, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2105.04s)]
*  there isn't a prize for them of, you know, money or it's just the kind of psychological fear that's [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2110.88s)]
*  instilled in the people that they're ruling. They're exhibiting their submission to the rule of, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2116.08s)]
*  you know, to the law of God. Yeah. And they say, and they say, here, here's the proof of it. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2121.36s)]
*  Submission, right? That is what, yeah. I mean, yes, that is the literal definition. Yeah. And so you [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2126.7200000000003s)]
*  escaped and you were caught a second time. When you come back at that point, you must be [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2134.88s)]
*  girding yourself for something really bad. Well, yeah, I mean, I had lived through many episodes [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2141.6800000000003s)]
*  of their violence by this point. So this was what occurred then was, was not particularly agonizing, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2147.6800000000003s)]
*  but it was terrifying because I, they flung me down at the feet of their sheikh. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2153.52s)]
*  And he said, I will kill you by my own hand this afternoon because you betrayed me. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2159.12s)]
*  And in fact, he didn't because he knew he was going to get money. He'd already been in negotiations [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2163.92s)]
*  with the nation of Qatar apparently. And by, but yeah, it was more terrifying. But you were, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2167.7599999999998s)]
*  you were a bank card for them. Yeah. I was, I was a sack of money. Yeah. And there's another thing [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2172.8s)]
*  that the journalists who are wandering around Syria at the moment don't understand, which is that [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2178.56s)]
*  there's not really, it's a failed state. It's like, there's no central authority. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2183.84s)]
*  Jolani appears to be in control, but every guy who drives a pickup is an entrepreneur as well. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2188.96s)]
*  And he needs sacks of money. Why does he need this? Cause he's got 10 guys in the back and they need [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2195.44s)]
*  bullets and falafel. Yeah. Like they, they need to eat and they need, they need weapons and guns. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2200.16s)]
*  Otherwise they won't be powerful. Otherwise those 10 guys in the back and are going to, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2205.84s)]
*  go off to the guy who does have money. So everybody needs cash and the journalists represent, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2209.92s)]
*  or any foreigner represents an enormous sack of cash. The only thing standing in the way of [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2214.32s)]
*  kidnapping those journalists at the moment is that, you know, there is nothing in the Quran that says [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2219.04s)]
*  go kidnap journalists. So, and they feel it's, might be wrong. They need to get a special [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2223.92s)]
*  authorization from an authority, but I think they can get it if they want it. Yeah. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2228.32s)]
*  Yeah. People like Austin Tice. I mean, the presumption is that it was the Assad regime [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2232.8799999999997s)]
*  that took him in about 2012. And his family has said recently that we have been on good authority [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2240.72s)]
*  that he's still alive. What do you know about that case? I mean, it's probably something that [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2248.0s)]
*  I imagine you look into because it's a similar. It is a similar case. Deep sympathy for Deborah [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2252.72s)]
*  Tice and the whole Tice family. I mean, I know them, of course. And they have been through [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2257.92s)]
*  something horrible and terrible and one wants to sympathize at the same time. All the available [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2263.36s)]
*  evidence that we have shows that he is in the hands of the Mujahideen, the Jabhat al-Nusra people, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2269.44s)]
*  Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, and that he is trying to placate them by saying la ilaha illallah. That's [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2275.36s)]
*  the, there is no God but God. This is what they make you say in the instance before they kill you. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2281.12s)]
*  Why do they do this? Because they want you, they believe that if you go to heaven with these words [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2285.92s)]
*  on your lips, it's possible that God will believe you have converted to Islam. Your soul is clean. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2292.56s)]
*  All your sins are wiped away and he will accept you into paradise. You live forever with the virgins. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2296.64s)]
*  So the last thing they do before they kill people, they make you say la ilaha illallah. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2300.96s)]
*  It's like a gesture of charity for them. You know, they're giving you this chance at heaven. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2306.08s)]
*  Anyway, all the evidence suggests that this person was captured by them at that time and place [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2310.56s)]
*  in which they were active and they were taking prisoners. I know this because [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2317.52s)]
*  in my prison, some of the people who were in my prison were captured then and there. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2321.12s)]
*  How is it that all the narrative has been for as long as he's been gone in the mainstream media, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2325.44s)]
*  that he was captured by Assad and that now that Assad has fallen, there's an opportunity [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2332.7999999999997s)]
*  to find him, which you presume that would be quite easy to film. Just, you know, walk out, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2338.96s)]
*  now I'm free, as so many of these prisoners have actually experienced this. But what you're saying [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2343.44s)]
*  is that the same people that kidnapped and tortured you are holding him currently? Or some, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2347.92s)]
*  is it some kind of affiliate group though? No, I'm saying that the available evidence we have [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2353.1200000000003s)]
*  is that he was taken by Mujahideen. And they did something with him. We don't know what they did, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2358.96s)]
*  but it looks very dangerous and frightening what they appear to be doing. And after this video [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2364.56s)]
*  appeared, are you convinced that he's still alive too? No, you're not. No, no. Okay. When, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2370.24s)]
*  after this video appeared on the internet, all the journalists looking at this said, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2374.72s)]
*  it can't be what we think it is. It must be the Assad government because the rebels, first of all, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2378.7999999999997s)]
*  they don't dress like this. By the way, they do dress like that. And they wouldn't take an [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2384.56s)]
*  American prisoner. By the way, they were looking for American prisoners. I was captured like four [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2388.4s)]
*  weeks after he was captured. So he was also in the military. And they, if I had been in the military, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2392.4s)]
*  the first thing they wanted to know about me is like, you know, that is the crime for which they [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2399.76s)]
*  could kill you because you have been killing their friends in Iraq. The people who are, are in charge [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2404.48s)]
*  of Syria now, they like made their, they developed their identity by fighting the Americans in [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2410.96s)]
*  Tanzim al-Qaeda, the al-Qaeda organization in Iraq. So, you know, the American military, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2418.56s)]
*  if they were to catch an American military guy in Syria, they would go, these are the guys, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2425.12s)]
*  they've been killing our friends. Now we're going to kill him. Yeah. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2429.04s)]
*  The real issue is that we could not fathom that there are, there is some other form of evil [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2433.92s)]
*  free in the land in Syria. We go, it must be Assad. It must be Assad. And in fact, you know, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2440.16s)]
*  the evidence suggests, no, it wasn't Assad, but we can't see that evidence. We can't make sense of [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2445.52s)]
*  it. Why do you think that is? Why can't we see something that seems, you know, you, you spill it [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2449.2s)]
*  out pretty quickly and pretty easily. I mean, it's fairly convincing, right? I think we have so little [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2453.68s)]
*  understanding of what's happening in that country. It's just like- What is the, what is the biggest [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2457.92s)]
*  sort of mistake and misconception that journalists who, you know, typically don't travel even to the [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2462.4s)]
*  region and write about this stuff, what is the mistake that they make that you see pretty [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2467.6s)]
*  consistently that drives you crazy? I mean, they assume that there's one person in control. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2471.6s)]
*  They assume, oh, now these people are in control and they, they will all take orders from that guy. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2475.52s)]
*  That's not how it works. It's like, if you put 10 of those guys on a soccer field and ask them to [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2480.88s)]
*  coordinate and play soccer together, they wouldn't do it. The only thing that keeps them together is [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2485.36s)]
*  cash. And, you know, each guy gets paid from his commander and provided that money keeps coming, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2490.08s)]
*  they're going to be loyal to that guy, but they don't have enough cash to keep these, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2496.4s)]
*  to hold the whole country together. Did you ever think that these people that were [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2501.04s)]
*  holding you would be in this position today in Damascus? No, I mean, this is quite an extraordinary- [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2504.88s)]
*  And how did it happen? Exactly. You don't, do you have any sense of what happened in that, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2509.52s)]
*  that made it, I mean, obviously so many people saying Ukraine has a lot to do with it because [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2514.48s)]
*  the Russians, Israel taking out Hezbollah commanders and Hassan Nasrallah, et cetera. I mean, I think- [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2519.36s)]
*  It's a lot of those things. When wars are won, it's because you exhaust the other party's will to [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2525.12s)]
*  fight. And the Syrian Arab army, which was the name of the Syrian government's army, they were like, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2530.64s)]
*  we're not doing this anymore. So they dissolved immediately. There's no fight for Damascus. So [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2535.92s)]
*  they had no more will to fight. They just surrendered. And these guys who held you [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2539.6s)]
*  have an infinite will to fight. That's right. That's the difference. They will do it and they [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2544.0s)]
*  believe that they're progressing either to Jerusalem or to heaven. In either case, it's good. So, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2549.68s)]
*  yeah, it's a huge morale, this morale problem for the Syrian government. They were very [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2558.16s)]
*  incompetent at maintaining a fighting force. That's why they lost. To Americans and people [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2564.64s)]
*  in general who are trying to figure out what's happening in Syria, if we were to assume that [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2572.96s)]
*  these guys, despite the name change, the Jolani's moderating rhetoric and everything, if we were [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2577.9199999999996s)]
*  just to take them as Jabhat al-Nusra, can you explain to people what the difference between [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2585.76s)]
*  Jabhat al-Nusra and ISIS was? Because you said there's some people that would flow between these [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2591.1200000000003s)]
*  organizations. I would say there's no difference. You'd say there's no difference? No. At one point, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2596.2400000000002s)]
*  Jolani, I mean, sorry, Baghdadi and Baghdad goes, hey, all those people who used to call themselves [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2601.1200000000003s)]
*  Jabhat al-Nusra, they're now ISIS. That was his declaration. Because the way that Jabhat al-Nusra [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2605.92s)]
*  started was he dispatched his four best friends who he had come to know at the American prison [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2611.84s)]
*  and an American prison in Iraq. He said, go over to Syria and take over that nation. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2617.52s)]
*  And those people were Jolani, Adnani, and another guy called Qahtani. And so, yeah, so that's, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2623.04s)]
*  they were a family of happy terrorists at that point. And it grew and grew and grew and grew. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2631.1200000000003s)]
*  And the philosophy was exactly the same. I know that the reporters and the academics, they go, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2635.6000000000004s)]
*  oh, there are these important distinctions between the two. But I defy you to go and find [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2639.92s)]
*  some dude in both of these organizations, go, what are the distinctions? They're not going to [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2644.32s)]
*  be able to tell you. They don't know. A theological distinction, perhaps, but [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2648.56s)]
*  do you think that if you were actually in Raqqa, in the possession of ISIS, that you would have [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2653.76s)]
*  survived? No, no. So there is some difference. The difference was that they had more money at [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2659.6s)]
*  the time. They did, like, Jabhat al-Nusra needed cash. And so they were like- So if they were [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2664.48s)]
*  flushed with cash, you were a dead man? Of course. And the reason why I went with Jabhat al-Nusra [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2669.2s)]
*  instead of ISIS was because they made an arbitrary decision. These people in these cells in this [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2674.3199999999997s)]
*  building are going that way with Jabhat al-Nusra. And those people in a slightly different cell in [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2678.7999999999997s)]
*  the same building are going with ISIS. How do you think you came out of the experience? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2683.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, I mean, and I mean this, and I apologize for asking the question, but like, psychologically, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2688.3199999999997s)]
*  how do you think you came out of it? Psychologically, I am much improved, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2693.3599999999997s)]
*  for which I'm very grateful to my former captors. It is a tonic and a life-affirming [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2696.48s)]
*  experience to almost lose your life. As cancer survivors know, and as people who have been in [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2703.52s)]
*  car crashes know, it's like you come this close to death and you go, oh my God, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2709.44s)]
*  it was almost all taken away from me and now I have a second chance. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2713.92s)]
*  But there's no people involved in those things in the sense that it's life- [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2717.6s)]
*  There's just a fate. Yeah, it's, well, I mean, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2721.28s)]
*  it could be a rainy night. It could be just bad luck. It could be smoking cigarettes that gives [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2724.88s)]
*  you cancer. But in this sense, to have a renewed spirit and faith in humanity even- [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2729.44s)]
*  I wouldn't say faith in humanity. Yeah, but I would break my faith in humanity [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2736.56s)]
*  and break my spirit, I would imagine. No, no, no. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2739.52s)]
*  You don't think so? No, I think you would be, I think that [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2742.32s)]
*  the system that they inflict on all their prisoners is good for all humankind. That's what it's there [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2744.88s)]
*  for. And I think that it would do the exact same thing to you that it did to me. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2749.6000000000004s)]
*  You would die to Michael Monand. You have no idea how weak I am. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2754.88s)]
*  I am psychologically and physically weak. I think that you would say to yourself, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2758.0s)]
*  my only chance of living is to submit. And when you came back, I think you would be [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2762.56s)]
*  stronger. When you were getting tortured? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2769.2000000000003s)]
*  No, no, I wanted it to end. But there was no rage or anything like that. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2770.88s)]
*  At first, of course, you combat the thing. You're in your denial phase, like, I got to fight this. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2777.2000000000003s)]
*  But eventually you go, it's too strong. I can't fight it. And they are too strong. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2781.84s)]
*  And the worst bits of that, you came out of this thinking kind of the same thing. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2786.08s)]
*  I mean, not right away. Not right away. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2794.6400000000003s)]
*  Not right. No, it took me. That's a transformation that happens in America or during your [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2796.88s)]
*  probably during the captivity, because it's like they made me, I so much believed that I was not [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2801.04s)]
*  going to come out of this alive. I gave up on my ever coming back to America. I gave up on like, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2809.28s)]
*  I went in kind of thinking, you know, I'm a writer. I'm like a journalist. This is sort of what I do [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2815.6000000000004s)]
*  is I'm good at this shit. And within maybe a few weeks, I'm like, OK, I don't need that stuff. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2820.48s)]
*  Who cares? I just want to live. And anyway, so I gave all of that up. I also gave up coming home. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2826.32s)]
*  I was like, I don't need that America place. It gives a shit. I could be happy here. I could [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2832.8s)]
*  have been happy there. You're not being tortured. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2836.96s)]
*  You're in the middle of the day. Maybe just eaten. No one's bothering you in your cell. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2839.76s)]
*  What are you thinking? What is the brain do in that period? I remember I think that you told me [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2845.92s)]
*  once you were writing in your head. Yeah. You were writing novels in your head. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2852.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, not in my head. No, I have I have a beautiful work of art that that that is about what happens [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2856.4s)]
*  when you submit to a cult like this and you wrote while you were there. Yeah. That they allowed me [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2862.8s)]
*  to write because they didn't know what I was writing. But you're writing a sort of code or [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2867.84s)]
*  just anything in English. English language. English was a code. Yeah. Yeah. They're not [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2872.1600000000003s)]
*  good at English. These guys. Yeah. And you say, yeah. Yeah. Many Syrians are very good at English. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2877.04s)]
*  However, these guys, you know, you can know something about their education by the fact that [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2883.2000000000003s)]
*  they can't understand a word of any language except Arabic. They don't want to because, you know, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2887.36s)]
*  Arabic is the language of God. Tell me about when it didn't. You were released. I mean, yeah. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2892.72s)]
*  I imagine, you know, your very dedicated mother was not was not thinking this would ever happen. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2899.8399999999997s)]
*  This did happen. Tell me about that day when you were released. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2909.3599999999997s)]
*  So much of what they were telling me at the time was like nonsense. You know, we're gonna we're [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2912.8799999999997s)]
*  gonna kill you. We're gonna hang you. We're not gonna kill you. We're gonna send you home. You're [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2918.72s)]
*  gonna be gonna live here as a dummy. Like you're gonna pay taxes and be a citizen of our state. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2922.8799999999997s)]
*  And for two years, they had been like making up lies for me. So when they finally said we're [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2927.8399999999997s)]
*  gonna send you home, I didn't believe them. I thought they might be putting me in this truck [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2932.7999999999997s)]
*  because they're gonna drive me out into the field to kill me. But at a certain point, we stopped at [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2936.24s)]
*  a clothes shop. I got rid of all the clothing they had given me, which at this point I was [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2939.8399999999997s)]
*  dressed like them. I was like in a mujahid outfit. So I got rid of that. I put on some sport like a [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2943.76s)]
*  sport suit, like a track suit. And then I saw we were in the southern part of Syria at that point, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2950.0800000000004s)]
*  which is on the Israeli border. And I saw that, like out the truck window, the guys were pointing [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2956.0s)]
*  to the landscape ahead. They go, that's Israel up there. I'm like, you know, maybe they maybe [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2960.88s)]
*  this will happen. And so you didn't know you this is a couple of hours, maybe an hour, a couple [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2966.48s)]
*  hours before you release and you had no idea. Right. No, I mean, I had some idea. I was hoping. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2972.16s)]
*  I was hoping, but I didn't trust them. But you stop hoping at a certain point because they tell you [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2976.96s)]
*  so many tales. Yeah, yeah, that's right. You live for the moment. You go, I might make it through [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2980.3999999999996s)]
*  the next 20 minutes. Yeah. And you're happy when you make it through the next time. And you go, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2984.8799999999997s)]
*  okay, I got another 20 minutes. But it's a they drove you to the border. They drove me to the [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2988.56s)]
*  border. And there's a there was there probably is there was a big al Qaeda station there with [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2992.48s)]
*  a flag on top and the Israelis, you know, is within eyesight of the Israeli surveillance places. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=2997.52s)]
*  And apparently at this time, I didn't know this, but Jebat Dnusra and the Israeli government were [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3004.24s)]
*  in some kind of collaboration because the time the Israeli government was thinking these guys [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3008.48s)]
*  oppose Assad and they oppose Hezbollah. And so we need to help them to topple Assad or to at least [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3013.12s)]
*  degrade Assad's capacity to make war and Hezbollah's capacity to make war. So anyway, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3020.8s)]
*  the Israelis were very tolerant of al Qaeda presence on their border like this, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3026.0s)]
*  which they are no longer by the time they were. Anyway, yeah, eventually they dropped me off at [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3030.1600000000003s)]
*  this UN post, like a no man's land kind of place in the U.N. They had made contact with the UN [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3035.6s)]
*  people beforehand. So UN people came out and brought me into their truck and I was free. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3042.56s)]
*  The people that drove you were the people you knew, the captors that you saw all the time. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3047.6800000000003s)]
*  All the way to the border, they're making a video which is out there somewhere. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3052.08s)]
*  Me saying like, I was saying to them what they wanted to hear. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3055.84s)]
*  Wait, have you seen this video? Do you know that it's out there? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3058.88s)]
*  I don't know that they have it. Yeah, I've made a lot of videos with these guys that haven't come [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3061.2s)]
*  out. Yeah, but you want to see them? I would be very curious to see them. You would? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3065.36s)]
*  Including like the capture, but and my trial they videotaped and also this ride to the border [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3069.52s)]
*  where they're saying goodbye. And they were like, what do you want to say to Abu Abu this one, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3074.72s)]
*  Abu this one, Abu that one? I'm like, goodbye, I'm gonna miss you. Goodbye, I'm gonna miss you. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3079.2s)]
*  Well, I'm saying what they want to hear. Of course. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3083.4399999999996s)]
*  And I don't want to say, hey, you are an asshole. Yeah, yeah. What if they shoot me? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3085.52s)]
*  You're that close to the border, you might as well say I'm really gonna miss you. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3088.96s)]
*  That's right. But, you know, I don't know. I mean, I think that most of these, these are young men [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3091.2s)]
*  that there's a part of them that wanted to go with me. They're like, that could be free. You know, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3097.6s)]
*  I want to be in charge. You think that they thought, no one ever told you that though, right? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3102.24s)]
*  Not in so many words. I believe that there is a part of every last one of them that believes [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3106.7200000000003s)]
*  we have the capacity to, to like, shape our own future, you know, earn money and go off and like, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3112.56s)]
*  be all you can be. They don't have that. They have to do what they're told. And they, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3118.4s)]
*  they're jealous of us for this freedom. So yeah, they, but of course, you know, they have nowhere [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3122.32s)]
*  to go. They have no money. They, they would, they, they have no future in the West. Once you go over [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3127.76s)]
*  to the dark side like that, most of them know they're not coming back. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3131.84s)]
*  Let me ask you one more thing about the future of Syria. I mean, I'm blown away at the, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3134.6400000000003s)]
*  we started talking and you told me that you've seen your captors on CNN, people that you saw [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3141.44s)]
*  in your torture cells that are active in the current, shall we say, interim Syrian government. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3148.1600000000003s)]
*  That must terrify you in some ways. I don't, I mean, I believe that their crimes, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3155.04s)]
*  I'm fine. The crimes that they're committing are the crimes against the Syrian people, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3161.92s)]
*  like all the minorities that they're never going to forgive, that they're killing now. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3166.0s)]
*  And so one wants justice for those people, those families that have never found their loved ones. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3169.6s)]
*  The loved ones just vanished and, and now they're never going to be found because [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3173.84s)]
*  those people in charge who killed them are never going to admit. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3178.08s)]
*  And you think that this current iteration of the Syrian government, whatever it is, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3181.6s)]
*  that this is a bunch of spin propaganda lies that Jelani and the al-Nusra people have [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3186.4s)]
*  reformed. How much faith do you put in that? I know what they really want. What they really want is, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3197.12s)]
*  is like every, a whole nation in harmony with Islam. And then the people that are not in harmony [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3204.08s)]
*  are doing what they're supposed to do according to the Quran, which is deep and total submission, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3209.84s)]
*  you know, to the law of God. So, so for instance, like you can't drink, that's why they're smashing [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3214.8s)]
*  up all the alcohol bottles. But you know, the, the, the law of God is a little bit arbitrary. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3218.88s)]
*  You can make them, you can violate it and not know it. And then they can kill you for that. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3225.76s)]
*  One of the things that they killed people for is insulting God. And like, you know, what is that? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3229.76s)]
*  Well, it's hard to say, but you don't expect that what we saw in the worst parts and the depths [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3235.04s)]
*  of Islamic State in Raqqa is going to be recreated through the entire borders of Syria. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3243.68s)]
*  No, because they know that that didn't work. They learned the lesson from, from ISIS. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3248.8799999999997s)]
*  They're rational in a way. Very rational. They were always the smarter group because ISIS got on TV. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3253.2s)]
*  They made a bunch of videos and they said, this is who we are. And that was evidently a mistake. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3258.16s)]
*  And it felt good for a little while, but I was there when they were doing this. And most of the [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3262.8799999999997s)]
*  rank and file were like jealous of all the immediate attention that ISIS was getting. But [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3267.6s)]
*  the commanders were like, that's stupid. They're just going to get themselves in trouble this way. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3271.76s)]
*  And that is indeed what happened. Would you go back to Syria? Do you have any desire to go back? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3276.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, I would, I would need proper security arrangements. Yeah. I mean, let's, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3281.92s)]
*  let's presume all that exists. I mean, is it a place that you would, if you were secure? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3287.36s)]
*  All these people that I went through all this, my ordeal with have escaped from prison, but they are [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3293.2000000000003s)]
*  still in, they need help. Like they would like an education. They would like, they would like a job. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3298.72s)]
*  Are you still involved in that and trying to help people? Yes. I mean, there's a whole generation [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3303.9199999999996s)]
*  of people who have, who I've been trying to get, you know, the universities in America to like, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3308.24s)]
*  can you waive the application fee for that person? Because we have no banking relations [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3313.04s)]
*  with the nation of Syria. You know, for 10 years, I've been trying to get universities to like [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3316.8799999999997s)]
*  read these people's applications and helping them with their applications. And believe me, it's, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3321.7599999999998s)]
*  it's, so it's, it's, it's, you know, what was going to be a couple of $200 stories became [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3325.8399999999997s)]
*  a life project. Yeah. A life project. Yeah. Theo, thank you for joining us. Thank you for having me. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmHid2Moaw&t=3332.72s)]
