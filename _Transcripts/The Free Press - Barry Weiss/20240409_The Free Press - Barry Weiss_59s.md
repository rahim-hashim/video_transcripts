# There were Zero Republicans at NPR’s D.C. Bureau
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [April 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwa0F2nZfao)
*  I got so frustrated with what I saw was the lack of different perspectives in our coverage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwa0F2nZfao&t=0.0s)]
*  that I decided to look at voter registration among our staff. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwa0F2nZfao&t=6.88s)]
*  I looked at DC where it was fairly easy to access voter registration records and what [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwa0F2nZfao&t=12.32s)]
*  I found was 87 registered Democrats on our editorial staff, zero Republicans. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwa0F2nZfao&t=17.92s)]
*  I presented this at all hands at a large news meeting and I said, hey look, something's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwa0F2nZfao&t=22.64s)]
*  gone wrong here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwa0F2nZfao&t=28.44s)]
*  If we're really thinking about diversity and our coverage, something is really off. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwa0F2nZfao&t=30.94s)]
*  If we have 87 Democrats and zero Republicans, maybe you wouldn't be surprised by this, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwa0F2nZfao&t=38.0s)]
*  but it's what I found. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwa0F2nZfao&t=43.52s)]
*  The response was, it wasn't like, wow, it wasn't like we're going to change this or [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwa0F2nZfao&t=47.32s)]
*  try and address this. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwa0F2nZfao&t=54.96s)]
*  Somehow it's just more like, wow, that's weird. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwa0F2nZfao&t=55.96s)]
