Video Description: When we planned the conversation you’re going to hear today—a live conversation with Douglas Murray—we thought it would be a searching conversation that we’d release on the anniversary of October 7th, looking back at a year of war from a slightly quieter moment. You’ll hear some of that today. But the moment is anything but quiet.

As we prepared yesterday afternoon for this conversation, the war that Iran has outsourced to its proxies for the last year finally became a war being waged by Iran itself, as it launched over 100 ballistic missiles towards Israel. Israel’s 9 million citizens huddled into bomb shelters, while missiles rained down on their homes, with a handful making direct impact. As of this recording, two people were injured, and one person was killed—that person was a Palestinian man in Jericho. Just before that onslaught, at least two terrorists opened fire at a train station in Jaffa, Israel, killing at least six people and injuring at least seven others.

No one understands the moral urgency of this moment better than my friend and guest today, Douglas Murray.

Douglas Murray isn’t Jewish. He has no Israeli family members. And yet it is Douglas Murray who understands the stakes of this war and the moral clarity that it requires.

Douglas’s work as a reporter has taken him to Iraq, North Korea, northern Nigeria, Ukraine, and most recently, to Israel. Douglas remained in Israel for months as he reported back with clarity, truth, and conviction. Douglas is the best-selling author of seven books, and is a regular contributor at the New York Post, the National Review, and here at The Free Press, where he writes our beloved Sunday column: “Things Worth Remembering.”

There is no one better to talk to in this moment, as we watch in real time as the Middle East—and the world as we know it—transforms before our eyes.

# Douglas Murray: A Time of War
**The Free Press - Barry Weiss:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY)
*  From the Free Press, this is Honestly and I'm Barry Weiss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=0.0s)]
*  Now when we planned tonight's conversation, I imagined that we would sort of be looking back, right? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=11.0s)]
*  We were going to release it on October 7th, which is I think today's Tuesday, which is next Monday. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=17.0s)]
*  And I thought we were going to sort of be looking back at the past year from a slightly quieter vantage point. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=22.0s)]
*  But then today happened. And quiet is sort of the last thing that's happening right now in the Middle East. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=29.0s)]
*  The war that Iran has outsourced to its proxies since October 7th, 2023, has now become a war between Iran explicitly and Israel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=37.0s)]
*  Hours before we sat down right here in this room in New York City, Iran launched over 100 ballistic missiles toward Israel. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=48.0s)]
*  Israel's nine million citizens huddled in bomb shelters, many of them friends and family of many people in this room. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=56.0s)]
*  A handful of them made direct impact. And as of this recording, two were injured and one person was killed. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=63.0s)]
*  That one person happened to be a Palestinian man walking on the street in Jericho. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=70.0s)]
*  Just before that onslaught, of course, two terrorists, at least two of them, opened fire at the train station in Jaffa, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=75.0s)]
*  killing at least six people and injuring at least seven others. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=83.0s)]
*  Now, for many of us in this room tonight, this war has been primary on our mind for the past 360 or so days. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=88.0s)]
*  But I think for a lot of Americans, it still feels like a faraway war. Right. And it isn't right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=101.0s)]
*  This is a battle for the free world, as our mutual friend Sam Harris put it in the weeks after October 7th. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=111.0s)]
*  There are not many bright lines that divide good and evil in our world. This is one of them. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=117.0s)]
*  This is a war, yes, between Israel and Iran, but it's also a war between civilization and barbarism. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=123.0s)]
*  And that was true 360 some days ago. And it's even more true today, I think. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=130.0s)]
*  And yet this testing moment has been met with alarming moral confusion. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=135.0s)]
*  I want to choose just a few examples from the last week, and I'm sure everyone here will be familiar with these. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=141.0s)]
*  At the UN, 12 countries, including the U.S., presented a plan for a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon without mentioning the word Hezbollah. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=147.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib tweeted, Our country is funding this bloodbath minutes after Israel assassinated the leader of the most fearsome terrorist army on the planet, Hassan Nasrallah, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=159.0s)]
*  who the New York Times described as beloved, a towering figure, and a powerful orator. We read it out loud at my home. It sounded like a letter of recommendation. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=170.0s)]
*  At Barnard, just 40 or so blocks from here, students chanted this week for an intifada moments after the Jewish community memorialized six civilian hostages murdered by Hamas. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=178.0s)]
*  At Yale this week, students chanted from Gaza to Beirut, All our martyrs we salute. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=189.0s)]
*  In Ottawa, protestors, if you think it's bad in America, Canada's somehow worse. In Ottawa, protestors shouting, Oh, Zionists, where are you? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=195.0s)]
*  Walked through a Jewish residential street filled with schools and homes for the elderly. Why did they do that? Because it was a street with Jewish schools and home for the elderly. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=204.0s)]
*  And that's just a few examples from the past week. The reason we are sitting here having this conversation is because no one that I know understands the moral urgency of this moment better than you, Douglas Murray. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=215.0s)]
*  Now, you're not Jewish. You have no Israeli family members, although I know a lot of Israeli families that consider you an adoptive family member. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=231.0s)]
*  And yet, it is you, more than almost anyone in the world, who has articulated the stakes of this war and the moral clarity that it requires. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=239.0s)]
*  Douglas's work as a reporter has taken him to Iraq, North Korea, Northern Nigeria, Ukraine, and most recently, of course, to Israel, where he became a celebrity. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=249.0s)]
*  You cannot walk down the streets of Tel Aviv without Douglas Murray. It's like being with the Beatles, and I'm not exaggerating. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=260.0s)]
*  And you decided to stay, a conversation I want to have with you, to cover most of that war. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=266.0s)]
*  You're also the bestselling author of seven books, and you're a regular contributor at the New York Post, which is the paper of record in New York City, the National Review, and most importantly, I think, at the Free Press, where you write the beloved Sunday column, Things Worth Remembering, which is reason enough to become a paid Free Press subscriber. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=273.0s)]
*  There is just no one I would rather be sitting with in this moment as we are watching in real time the Middle East and really the world transform before our eyes. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=293.0s)]
*  So, Douglas Murray, welcome to Honestly, and thanks so much for being here. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=301.0s)]
*  A pleasure to be with you, Barry. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=305.0s)]
*  Okay, so we are speaking on the eve of what some people, and I'm sure your phone was blowing up in the way mine was all afternoon, of what some people are saying, this is it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=307.0s)]
*  This is the beginning of World War III. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=317.0s)]
*  At the very least, this is the moment, sort of, that we've, in a weird way, been waiting for, if you can say such a thing, since October 7. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=320.0s)]
*  This is the mask-off moment. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=328.0s)]
*  And I guess the first question I want to ask you is, how did we get here? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=330.0s)]
*  How did we get to a moment where Iran is dropping 100 ballistic missiles on Israel and, you know, Israel is vowing to respond to it? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=335.0s)]
*  What are the factors that led us to this moment? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=344.0s)]
*  Probably just like the Finland station, the terrible decision to allow a train to arrive in Russia in 1917 carrying Lenin, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=347.0s)]
*  the plane that took off in 1979 from Paris, taking to Tehran, the Ayatollah Khomeini, is one of the two worst journeys of the 20th century. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=361.0s)]
*  And all of this starts from there. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=374.0s)]
*  Iran had the opportunity to be a sort of progressive country in the region. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=377.0s)]
*  In the 1970s, Israel had an ambassador in Iran, as you know. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=382.0s)]
*  There was the opportunity for normalization along the same lines as what happened between Israel and Egypt, Israel and Jordan, the more recent years with the Abraham Accords. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=388.0s)]
*  But the revolutionary Islamic government in Tehran chose a different path. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=399.0s)]
*  It's a millenarian, apocalyptic terror movement that has immiserated the people of Iran since what is also coincidentally the year of my birth. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=405.0s)]
*  And the revolutionary Islamic government has decided to oppress the people it presumes to govern and try to expand itself across the region. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=415.0s)]
*  And my worry early in the period after October 7th was that Israel would spend all of its political and military capital defeating Hamas. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=429.0s)]
*  And I never thought that that was the aim. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=442.0s)]
*  I thought that the aim was to defeat Hamas and then make sure that every other terror proxy of Iran, of the Iranian revolutionary government, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=445.0s)]
*  as I always remember to say and as I always remind my good Iranian friends that I should say because we shouldn't say it's Iran. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=456.0s)]
*  It's not. It's a disgusting regime. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=463.0s)]
*  My worry was always that Hamas would take up all of the energy and that Israel wouldn't be allowed, as it were, to do what else needed to be done. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=466.0s)]
*  So, almost a year on we could look back with all of the grief and sadness and horror about what happened on the 7th and the losses of many fine soldiers fighting Hamas house to house in Gaza. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=477.0s)]
*  But as it happens, as we come to the first anniversary, the tide has turned. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=495.0s)]
*  And the Israeli government and the Israeli armed forces and military have shown that there is a price to pay for trying to eradicate the Jewish people. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=502.0s)]
*  And the price is being paid and it's high and it should always have been high and it will probably get higher. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=512.0s)]
*  This is a point of clarification. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=520.0s)]
*  Iran used to, the Iranian revolutionary government used to enjoy sending rockets into Israel from Gaza using its proxy Hamas. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=523.0s)]
*  Hamas is almost completely destroyed. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=531.0s)]
*  Its cowardly leader, Yahya Sinwar, is hiding in a tunnel somewhere in the south of Gaza surrounded by what he would regard as being the best hostages. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=534.0s)]
*  That's his end. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=548.0s)]
*  But his colleagues, his comrades, they've all gone. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=551.0s)]
*  They've lost. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=555.0s)]
*  They're in the dust of Gaza. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=557.0s)]
*  No one misses them. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=559.0s)]
*  In the north, Hezbollah was meant to be the great army of the Tehran mullahs. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=561.0s)]
*  In less than two weeks, Hezbollah has been utterly destroyed. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=570.0s)]
*  First of all, 3,000 of their operatives have the misfortune of believing, as they may have been right to believe they couldn't trust their cell phones, decided to go to the old-fashioned pager devices. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=578.0s)]
*  But someone, we don't know who, put explosives in all of those pager devices. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=590.0s)]
*  And so 3,000 of their operatives in one moment across Lebanon and Syria all suffered grievous injury. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=596.0s)]
*  The next day, their walkie-talkies blew up. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=605.0s)]
*  By day three, they couldn't trust to put on a kettle in Beirut. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=608.0s)]
*  Then the senior membership of Hezbollah that still remained met in a building, and then they were struck. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=613.0s)]
*  Then, best of all, when Benjamin Netanyahu came to New York last week, he went on stage to the UN. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=619.0s)]
*  I watched from the gallery as the traditional walkout of various despots and dictators and their minions occurred as he was doing it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=629.0s)]
*  Somewhere in Beirut, Hassan Nasrallah was watching Benjamin Netanyahu on television, and that's when Hassan Nasrallah went to meet his maker. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=639.0s)]
*  It's like the baptism seed from the Godfather. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=649.0s)]
*  It's... [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=652.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=654.0s)]
*  I was told by a Jewish friend the other day that apparently there is something in Torah, the Jewish tradition, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=656.0s)]
*  that says that one should not take enormous delight in the decimation of one's foes. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=665.0s)]
*  But I'm not Jewish. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=673.0s)]
*  And so I don't have to follow this. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=675.0s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah and the other people who have just also gone to the dust have not just spent recent decades killing Israelis, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=684.0s)]
*  kidnapping them from the border regions, firing rockets at people and communities across the north of Israel. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=696.0s)]
*  They killed 241 American Marines in 1983, and they got away with it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=703.0s)]
*  They got away with it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=709.0s)]
*  They killed French soldiers. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=712.0s)]
*  They killed many other foreign nationals. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=715.0s)]
*  They killed people. They kidnapped them. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=717.0s)]
*  They got away with it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=719.0s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=721.0s)]
*  As Benjamin Netanyahu said when he spoke at Congress in July, he said, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=724.0s)]
*  He said, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=729.0s)]
*  Now, that's Hezbollah, the organization formerly known as Hezbollah, or whatever we will have to call them. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=738.0s)]
*  They've lost almost all of the ammunition. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=744.0s)]
*  They've stored up to fire at Israel all these decades. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=747.0s)]
*  The United Nations was meant to oversee a resolution. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=750.0s)]
*  I remember I was there in the war in 2006, and I remember the war finishing. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=753.0s)]
*  I remember the United Nations all calling for a ceasefire again, and all of the years afterwards, it turns out, lo and behold, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=756.0s)]
*  you don't have to follow United Nations resolutions if you don't want to. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=762.0s)]
*  And Hezbollah did not want to, and so they built up their rocket arsenal, and most of that has been destroyed in recent days. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=765.0s)]
*  So that's Iran's proxy to the north. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=773.0s)]
*  The Houthis in Yemen, everyone's favorite new terrorists, recently discovered by morons on American campuses. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=776.0s)]
*  Well, they're not doing too well either, because it turns out that if you do the bidding of your paymasters in Tehran [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=783.0s)]
*  and you fire missiles at Israel, you'll be taken out too. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=792.0s)]
*  So now is the point of clarification. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=796.0s)]
*  The mullahs in Tehran do not any longer have active proxies able to try to destroy the Jewish state. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=799.0s)]
*  They've gone in Gaza. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=807.0s)]
*  They've gone in Lebanon in the process of going. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=809.0s)]
*  They're going in Yemen. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=812.0s)]
*  So it's the mullahs versus Israel. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=814.0s)]
*  So what happens next? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=817.0s)]
*  I mean, you are deeply, deeply sourced in Israel, and you become somewhat close, I think, to the prime minister, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=819.0s)]
*  who has said in sort of no uncertain terms he's going after the mullahs next. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=827.0s)]
*  He's also been saying that for a while. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=832.0s)]
*  It's only now become more and more explicit. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=834.0s)]
*  What do you think the next few weeks looks like, if you can share that? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=837.0s)]
*  Well, I can't speak for the prime minister, but I would just say that it seems obvious that if Tehran is going to fire ballistic missiles at Israel, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=840.0s)]
*  Israel has to be allowed to reply in kind. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=852.0s)]
*  But the Israeli way of war is a way of war that is, of course, for them it's existential. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=854.0s)]
*  As Golda Meir famously said, we can't afford to lose once. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=863.0s)]
*  And the mullahs have made their choice. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=867.0s)]
*  Is it possible that they could be punished in a way that would be something which would topple the regime? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=872.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=880.0s)]
*  I don't know if Israel can do that alone or if America needs to do it with them. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=882.0s)]
*  But just imagine what the region would look like if that flight had not been allowed to land in 1979. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=886.0s)]
*  All of this would have not happened. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=895.0s)]
*  God knows the Palestinians could have had another state. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=898.0s)]
*  But the mullahs chose their route, and they're losing. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=901.0s)]
*  Let's talk about America and its relationship to Israel in this moment, because on the one hand, you know, Joe Biden has declared he's a Zionist. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=907.0s)]
*  America is still Israel's most important ally. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=916.0s)]
*  It gives it tons of foreign aid. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=920.0s)]
*  We could go on and on and on if we wanted to make the case for this White House on that score. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=921.0s)]
*  But on the other hand, you could make a very different argument, which is you could argue that the roots of what we're seeing play out tonight over the skies of Israel has—goes back to the Obama administration and to an embrace of a sort of rapprochement with Iran. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=927.0s)]
*  I wondered if you could sort of comment on that and whether the past 24 hours are kind of like mark to market moment for that foreign policy worldview. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=946.0s)]
*  Like, is that over? Has that been fully shattered and collapsed? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=957.0s)]
*  Or are we going to still going to have to pretend as if—well, you tell me. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=960.0s)]
*  Well, you know, Herb Stein's law, things that cannot go on won't. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=965.0s)]
*  It's the law that economists are fond of. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=969.0s)]
*  But in foreign policy establishment, things that cannot go on usually do. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=972.0s)]
*  There are two completely defunct paradigms which is still being pursued in Washington, Paris, and London. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=979.0s)]
*  Number one, that if you give the Palestinians yet another state, by which I mean not being given a state in 2005 in Gaza isn't enough and everything they've done since isn't enough, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=986.0s)]
*  let's give them another one because maybe next time they won't decide to do a genocidal state again. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=998.0s)]
*  First thing is this idea that Antony Blinken—Antony Blinken said a couple of days after the 7th of October, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1004.0s)]
*  this is why we need to double down on the two-state solution. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1009.0s)]
*  You want another Palestinian state in order to become another terror state? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1012.0s)]
*  And you reward them for the terror by giving them another state? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1017.0s)]
*  That's delusion number one. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1022.0s)]
*  Delusion number two is this idea that—and my gosh, Obama, the Obama administration was the worst at this— [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1024.0s)]
*  was this idea that you wait for the moderate reformer to appear under the mullahs into Iran. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1032.0s)]
*  Every single Iranian president in my lifetime who has come, every prime minister, every foreign minister, is always saying, ah, the reformists. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1038.0s)]
*  I mean, it's not even reformists in that, you know, the hard line is to kill all the Jews and the reformists are to kill most. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1048.0s)]
*  It's not even that. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1054.0s)]
*  It's that they don't come. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1056.0s)]
*  The regime is set up in such a way they don't come. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1060.0s)]
*  It was always a delusion of the Obama administration and others. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1063.0s)]
*  You could coax the Ayatollahs to the table. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1067.0s)]
*  They don't want to be at the table. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1070.0s)]
*  If they wanted to be at the table, if they wanted to be this reformist thing, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1072.0s)]
*  they wouldn't have set up this death trap in southern Lebanon, which in my view and the view of many others, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1075.0s)]
*  was always there in order to get the opportunity of the mullahs to get atomic weaponry, genocidal weaponry to fire at the Jewish state [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1081.0s)]
*  and to have Hezbollah there in order to make sure that Israel and America never struck the nuclear reactors [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1092.0s)]
*  or if they did, all 160,000 missiles would start being pointed at, would be fired at Tel Aviv and Haifa. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1098.0s)]
*  That has been taken away from them now. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1104.0s)]
*  But this delusion that the revolutionary Islamic government can be brought into the fold is what many people, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1107.0s)]
*  John Kerry, Jack Straw, these people all thought this was the case. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1114.0s)]
*  They've been proven wrong again and again. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1121.0s)]
*  And in recent days and weeks, we've had the spectacle of people who have never had to see a war, let alone fight one, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1123.0s)]
*  saying all the time that Israel has to go for a ceasefire. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1131.0s)]
*  They were flat out wrong. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1137.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris said, don't go into Ra'afah. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1139.0s)]
*  Ra'afah was the stronghold of Hamas in Gaza. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1143.0s)]
*  The IDF went into Ra'afah. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1146.0s)]
*  They got a lot more of the senior leadership of Hamas. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1149.0s)]
*  We knew they would. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1152.0s)]
*  They got some more hostages back. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1153.0s)]
*  But Kamala Harris said she looked at the maps and she knew better because, I mean, after all, nobody in the IDF has ever looked at the maps, I'm sure. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1155.0s)]
*  And then in recent days, we have the situation with Lebanon. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1164.0s)]
*  It's all, oh, the Israelis are attacking Lebanon. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1168.0s)]
*  No, they are freeing Lebanon from Hezbollah. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1171.0s)]
*  Lebanon used to be a relatively progressive and prosperous country for the region. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1175.0s)]
*  We've had many Christians, among others, and an extraordinary, even for the Middle East, an unbelievable petri dish of traditions and ancient communities. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1180.0s)]
*  And they have been decimated by Hezbollah, by the Shiite militia of Iran in Lebanon. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1189.0s)]
*  And Israel goes in to get Hezbollah out. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1195.0s)]
*  And the American government says ceasefire? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1201.0s)]
*  No, not ceasefire. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1204.0s)]
*  Victory should always have been about victory. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1206.0s)]
*  You cannot keep fighting wars that you're not allowed to win. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1209.0s)]
*  And that's what I said from the very first moment after the seventh. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1213.0s)]
*  Every single time, Israel is made to fight wars it is not allowed to win. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1217.0s)]
*  We, I mean, we in the international community were expected to see it as normal that every 15 to 20 years, Israel had to fight a war in southern Lebanon. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1222.0s)]
*  Every two to three years, it had to fight a war in Gaza. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1231.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1233.0s)]
*  Every single time, because the international community, including American administrations, tried to stop them and did stop them before the moment of victory. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1234.0s)]
*  There was an Israeli politician and general who I spoke with early in this conflict who said, I had the opportunity to snuff out Hamas entirely in 2010, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1242.0s)]
*  and I was pulled back by my government at the demand of the American government and the international community. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1254.0s)]
*  Well, well done those people. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1262.0s)]
*  Well done the people who sustained that status quo. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1264.0s)]
*  It meant we had war after war, and now they have this. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1266.0s)]
*  This is the fruit of their labor. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1269.0s)]
*  We now know from Financial Times reporting over the past few days that Israel in the days after October 7th had a way or they believe they had a way to get Nasrallah, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1272.0s)]
*  and the Americans stopped them. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1282.0s)]
*  And there's story after story about how the Americans sort of interceded. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1284.0s)]
*  And the theme that emerges for me is they seem to view not the terrorist group, not Iran, not Islamic totalitarianism as the enemy, but escalation itself as the enemy. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1288.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1303.0s)]
*  And the problem is that when you need to win a war, you need to escalate. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1304.0s)]
*  Absolutely you need to escalate. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1306.0s)]
*  And I mean, by the way, I mean, I don't know. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1309.0s)]
*  Everything I ever know about when I read a story about it in the Financial Times, they're always wrong. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1313.0s)]
*  It's possible they're right on something to do with Ecuadorian politics every now and then. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1321.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1326.0s)]
*  But on anything I know about it, the Financial Times doesn't seem to me to be a very respectful journal. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1327.0s)]
*  But maybe they're right. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1336.0s)]
*  I had heard that rumor from elsewhere. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1339.0s)]
*  Of course, the whole thing is always about de-escalation, always de-escalation. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1341.0s)]
*  This is this madness, as again, of people, governments drunk on peace, thinking that peace is the only thing that should ever happen. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1344.0s)]
*  And you don't need to go back to Ecclesiastes to know this, but perhaps we can. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1356.0s)]
*  To everything under the sun there is a season. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1360.0s)]
*  And the list includes a time of war and a time of peace. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1364.0s)]
*  This is a time of war. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1371.0s)]
*  And it was a war started by the mullahs in Tehran when they decided to send their barbarians into Israel on the 7th to rape and burn and murder their way. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1373.0s)]
*  They chose the war. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1384.0s)]
*  The Israelis want a time of peace. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1386.0s)]
*  Most people in the region want a time of peace. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1388.0s)]
*  But in order to get to peace, you have to get to victory in war. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1391.0s)]
*  Speaking of publications you admire, I want to quote something from the BBC today. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1395.0s)]
*  Shortly after Iran launched these ballistic missiles against Israel, one of its commentators said this, and I promise you it is not satire. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1402.0s)]
*  The international community has to make sure that whatever Israel does is not upending the regional order as we know it. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1410.0s)]
*  We've been in this for 12 months now of constant red lines being crossed, mostly by the Israelis. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1417.0s)]
*  Hezbollah and Iran have played it fairly rationally, trying to always be cautious in how they respond, trying to leave off-ramps where they could. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1423.0s)]
*  By the way, this moron is a teacher at King's College in London. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1431.0s)]
*  He worked for four years for the Qatari government. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1439.0s)]
*  He was in the pay of the Qatari government. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1444.0s)]
*  He now teaches at King's College London, which is funded by the Qataris. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1447.0s)]
*  Why the British Broadcasting Corporation should be inviting on people who are in the pay of Qatar, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1450.0s)]
*  which is the mini-terror state, to Iran's great terror state in the region, I don't know. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1460.0s)]
*  But that's why you get moronic commentary like that. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1466.0s)]
*  I know, it's so sad. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1470.0s)]
*  It's so sad that the regional status quo of firing missiles at Israel can't be retained, isn't it? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1472.0s)]
*  It's barbaric, isn't it? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1478.0s)]
*  The same thing happened after one of the recent bouts against Hezbollah. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1480.0s)]
*  One of the BBC Sky commentators said that Hezbollah had been appallingly provoked by Israel, provoked beyond toleration, really. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1488.0s)]
*  Poor Hezbollah. There they were, simply wanting to launch rockets in peace. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1498.0s)]
*  Then they got disrupted. It's beastly. Absolutely beastly. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1503.0s)]
*  No, the status quo that has existed was rancid and rotten and anti-Israel, and it had no right to continue. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1509.0s)]
*  But these people, I mean, we have to ask ourselves in all these institutions, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1516.0s)]
*  How do you end up with one of these Qatari stooges at a Qatari-funded institution in London, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1520.0s)]
*  giving his Qatari propaganda for a terror state on the British Broadcasting Corporation? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1526.0s)]
*  It's rot all the way down, rot in the media, supported by rotted institutions of rotten states like Qatar, which think they've bought us. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1532.0s)]
*  And maybe they have. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1543.0s)]
*  Oh. Oh, we should turn that around. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1545.0s)]
*  They think they own us. They are one of the weakest states in the world. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1549.0s)]
*  It's a few hundred thousand people with a disgusting crime family at its head, and the people own slave after slave in that country. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1555.0s)]
*  It's a slave-owning state with a couple of hundred thousand people who actually have some money, and they think they've bought America and Britain? Seriously. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1564.0s)]
*  Well, we're cheap. That's the lesson I'm taking from the fact that some of our greatest universities are willing to have outposts in these countries. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1572.0s)]
*  Yeah, same thing with the funding capital of American universities. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1582.0s)]
*  Our bankers, our sports teams, spit and you will hit someone in this neighborhood that's a paid-up, I don't know, we're not going to say a Qatari agent, but on the Qatari payroll in some way. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1585.0s)]
*  How is that allowed to happen? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1596.0s)]
*  Well, look, it seems to be quite easy to seize Russian assets if you don't like Vladimir Putin's actions in recent years. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1598.0s)]
*  Fine. Get the Qataris. Why not? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1604.0s)]
*  I mean, in recent years it was agreed by the international community that has some moral clarity on some issues some of the time that you're not allowed to roll tanks into Ukraine and try to seize Ukraine. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1608.0s)]
*  And as a result of that, all these people associated with Vladimir Putin had those super yachts taken. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1620.0s)]
*  Fine. Show the Qataris how it's done. Take their stuff. Seize it. See how they run as a state when they can't protect themselves and see whether their slave class that they import to literally act as slaves in the 21st century are going to stay around. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1625.0s)]
*  They think we're vulnerable. We make them vulnerable. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1642.0s)]
*  But the fact that they have been able to penetrate the West in the way that they have with such ease shows our weakness. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1649.0s)]
*  Yes, because we're weak and we're silly and we're drunk on peace. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1657.0s)]
*  Let's get back to that in a minute. I want to ask you one question about Ukraine since you brought it up. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1660.0s)]
*  One, I wouldn't even call it an emergent phenomenon. I think it's now become the consensus on large portions of the American right is that Israel, let's support that war, but Ukraine, let's give up on those guys. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1666.0s)]
*  To be very crude about it. I would say Israel has become almost a conservative cause and Ukraine has become a liberal cause. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1677.0s)]
*  And I find this quite strange because the way that I see it, these two conflicts are profoundly and deeply linked. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1684.0s)]
*  But your conservative and many of your fellow conservatives no longer see it that way. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1692.0s)]
*  What are they seeing? And what's the case you would make to them that the cause of Ukraine should also be the cause of those that support Israel? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1696.0s)]
*  Well, the cause of Ukraine is obvious, which is a sort of rather basic lesson for the 20th century that you shouldn't be allowed to roll tanks into other countries with impunity. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1706.0s)]
*  It used to be rather widely recognized and also it's never quite a good idea to start redrawing the borders of the outskirts of Europe because you can open up an awful lot of old enmities that way. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1717.0s)]
*  There's quite a lot of trouble in that part of the world. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1730.0s)]
*  But tell that to JD Vance or Donald Trump. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1733.0s)]
*  Well, I think they get that. I think they get that. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1736.0s)]
*  I think that the problem that's happened with the right on Ukraine is, well, you're right that it's become a sort of left-wing shibboleth, you know, the people who've never. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1739.0s)]
*  They're heuristic, is the same people that put up the black square in 2020 and then put the pronouns in their bio, then put up the Ukraine flag, ergo we shouldn't support Ukraine. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1750.0s)]
*  Exactly, which is all true. And I mean, there are a lot of irritating people out there. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1761.0s)]
*  But just because people are irritating does not mean that you can form your foreign policy in opposition to irritating people. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1764.0s)]
*  The thing that has changed on the right with Ukraine, as I see it, is that after the spring offensive last year failed and it did fail, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1772.0s)]
*  it was not clear that Ukraine was going to continue to be able to seize land back from Putin. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1784.0s)]
*  I was with the Ukrainian Armed Forces when they retook Kyrgyzstan and Mykolaiv, and it was a very heady time. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1791.0s)]
*  But there were not further land gains like that. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1797.0s)]
*  And when the spring offensive failed, I think quite a lot of people thought it's likely this is, I mean, Henry Kissinger, among others, said this at the time. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1801.0s)]
*  It seems that there's going to be some kind of negotiated settlement that will include a change of borders in the region. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1810.0s)]
*  And once people started to see that, then yes, a lot of support fell away. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1816.0s)]
*  And by the way, when you see the people on the left saying, we will support Ukraine until the absolute end, no, they won't. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1822.0s)]
*  The Germans have already been pulling back. They fall away. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1829.0s)]
*  And this is, by the way, one of the things about war. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1834.0s)]
*  There is nothing at all that compares with winning. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1837.0s)]
*  If you don't win, that's everything. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1843.0s)]
*  Shortly after the seventh, the rabbi in London is a very nice man, but he's reformed. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1846.0s)]
*  And I'm a non-Jewish Orthodox Jew. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1851.0s)]
*  Sitting in the front row, our host, I should say, is a reform rabbi. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1861.0s)]
*  But I have my criticisms anyway. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1865.0s)]
*  We'll get you the black hat. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1867.0s)]
*  A very nice reform rabbi said to me, you know, I sometimes worry, Douglas, that you talk about things in a way that's too binary. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1871.0s)]
*  And, you know, things aren't binary. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1881.0s)]
*  And I said, well, actually, some things are. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1886.0s)]
*  And he said, like what? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1892.0s)]
*  I said, win, lose. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1894.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1898.0s)]
*  Give me a clearer binary in the world. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1899.0s)]
*  You win a war and you've won it. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1901.0s)]
*  You lose it. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1903.0s)]
*  Got nothing to stand on. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1904.0s)]
*  It's over. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1906.0s)]
*  You don't own your own land. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1907.0s)]
*  You don't have your own army. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1908.0s)]
*  You can't protect your family. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1909.0s)]
*  You can't stop your people being killed. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1911.0s)]
*  Now, look, Ukraine has, as I say, fallen into a sort of torpor as a war. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1914.0s)]
*  And a lot of people want to end it. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1919.0s)]
*  And a lot of people think it'll probably just have to be settled by some gruesome and difficult land swap. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1920.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1927.0s)]
*  Israel is different on this because there is the glimpse, the clear sight at this point, particularly after recent weeks. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1928.0s)]
*  There is a sight of what victory looks like. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1935.0s)]
*  And that is what makes these conflicts at this stage different. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1939.0s)]
*  It makes it wildly different because it is clear at this point how this war in the Middle East could end. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1945.0s)]
*  And it's possible also, and this perhaps doesn't get said often enough, it's possible once again to see what the Middle East could look like if these two delusions fell away. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1952.0s)]
*  If instead of everyone obsessing about the Palestinians getting another state, they thought about improving the living conditions of the Palestinians. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1962.0s)]
*  If instead of talking about the importance of bringing Iran in from the cold, the mullahs in from the cold, we talked about, if Washington had spent 1% of the time, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1970.0s)]
*  it has spent trying to get Benjamin Netanyahu out of power in Jerusalem, trying to get the mullahs out of power in Tehran. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1983.0s)]
*  The mullahs would be out of power in Tehran by now. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1990.0s)]
*  Every American government for 30 years has been trying to get Benjamin Netanyahu out of office. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=1993.0s)]
*  Bill Clinton sent teams of people over to get Netanyahu to lose the election in the 90s when Netanyahu says in his memoirs, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2001.0s)]
*  Bill Clinton calls him up to congratulate him after he wins the prime ministership, gets to the coalition, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2010.0s)]
*  and Bill Clinton says, well, we did everything we could to keep you out, but we're looking forward to working with you. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2015.0s)]
*  But the point is that it has been American government policy to change the prime minister in Israel. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2022.0s)]
*  Whatever you think of him, he's the one who can put together coalitions. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2030.0s)]
*  What have they done when the Iranian people took to the streets like in 2009? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2034.0s)]
*  Nothing, nothing. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2039.0s)]
*  So if you didn't have that terror regime oppressing the people of Iran and spreading their terror around the region, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2041.0s)]
*  look at what's possible. Look at what's possible. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2049.0s)]
*  Look at what Bahrain has achieved in recent years. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2053.0s)]
*  Look at what Saudi has been able to achieve in recent years. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2055.0s)]
*  There are developments in Saudi Arabia I never thought would be seen in generations in terms of liberalization. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2058.0s)]
*  Now, does it yet look like Berkeley? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2066.0s)]
*  No, thank God. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2068.0s)]
*  And I always like to think there might be somewhere in liberal terms between Riyadh and Berkeley. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2070.0s)]
*  And we think if we can find that civilizational G-spot, let's do it. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2076.0s)]
*  But Saudi has done extraordinary things. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2081.0s)]
*  And the same with the Emiratis. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2090.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, you have Israelis holidaying in the UAE, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2096.0s)]
*  and you have international businesses doing business in Saudi. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2101.0s)]
*  You have pop concerts in Saudi. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2107.0s)]
*  Again, I mean, okay, it feels like, yeah, well, we were there a while ago. Fine. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2109.0s)]
*  This was a society that had not caught up with the eighth century until a few years ago. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2114.0s)]
*  And it's coming into the 21st century. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2122.0s)]
*  And there is this opportunity to say, look, how about if everything normalized, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2125.0s)]
*  look at what the Israelis could do with these countries in terms of water supplies or technology or crops or new energy or all of these things. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2131.0s)]
*  Look at what's possible. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2141.0s)]
*  And there is a future possible for the region. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2143.0s)]
*  It does not involve the mullahs in Tehran having power. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2146.0s)]
*  And it is not predicated on Mahmoud Abbas or the PA or whatever comes next in Gaza creating the perfect Palestinian state. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2152.0s)]
*  The region cannot wait for that. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2166.0s)]
*  It has waited for that for decades. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2168.0s)]
*  And the Palestinian leadership has never been serious about it. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2170.0s)]
*  It never wanted it. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2173.0s)]
*  It walked away like it walked away in 1947, 1948. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2174.0s)]
*  And again, I mean, I'm a little hardline on this at this point, but I believe that if you have kept being offered a state and you have kept waging war, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2178.0s)]
*  you do not continue to have the right to keep on being handed state after state after state. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2191.0s)]
*  The Palestinians want another state. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2197.0s)]
*  They should earn it as everybody else has, as Israel did. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2199.0s)]
*  But by the way, what I just said is so far out of the open window in Washington still where it is like, let's give them more states. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2206.0s)]
*  But what do you do if you're Israel? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2212.0s)]
*  In other words, I don't disagree with the idea that if the Palestinians of the West Bank were given a state tomorrow, that that would likely turn toward Hamas. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2214.0s)]
*  At best, it'll be another failed Arab state. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2224.0s)]
*  And most likely, it will just be another Iranian proxy state. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2228.0s)]
*  So well done, all you kids on campus who thought that everything in the world would unfurl into peace if another rotten state was created in the Middle East. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2233.0s)]
*  But then occupation forever? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2242.0s)]
*  No. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2243.0s)]
*  Then what? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2244.0s)]
*  That's for the Israeli government to work out, among others. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2247.0s)]
*  And by the way, you know, one of the things about the Palestinian question to my mind is that just take Gaza for the time being. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2251.0s)]
*  It's very hard to know what you do with Gaza now. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2262.0s)]
*  I don't think the Israelis should reoccupy it. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2265.0s)]
*  I'm very nervous about the fact that there will almost certainly have to be IDF at the Philadelphia Corridor. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2270.0s)]
*  My colleague and friend, Natasha Hausdorff, was down at the Philadelphia Corridor the other week, which is the strip between Gaza and Egypt, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2277.0s)]
*  a piece of land that most Western journalists seem to not know exists. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2288.0s)]
*  But anyway, I'm nervous about the fact that IDF will have to be at the Philadelphia Corridor, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2292.0s)]
*  but they have to be because, as Natasha showed me the photographs the other day, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2299.0s)]
*  these huge tunnels, and as big as any of the tunnels I've seen in Gaza in the last year, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2303.0s)]
*  are for military-sized vehicles to drive through, driving rockets and ammunition into Gaza. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2308.0s)]
*  And they're all under Egyptian army checkpoints. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2315.0s)]
*  So obviously the Egyptians can't be trusted with that, from stopping them getting in. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2318.0s)]
*  So yes, there will have to be Israeli troops at the Philadelphia Corridor. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2323.0s)]
*  I'm very nervous about it, however, because I think that we will hear for many years of young men and women in the IDF [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2327.0s)]
*  patrolling that and getting shot or kidnapped by terrorists in Gaza. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2335.0s)]
*  However, something has to be done for the people of Gaza, with the people of Gaza. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2341.0s)]
*  I think they should hopefully have learned by now that there is a terrible price to pay for voting for a terrorist group to run you. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2347.0s)]
*  And if something can be done, among other things, that you don't have groups like UNRWA teaching young Gaza kids, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2358.0s)]
*  they had 18 years to run the Gaza and they brought up a generation of sociopaths. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2369.0s)]
*  They brought them up with math books that are like, if you kill two Jews and then kill two more Jews, how many dead Jews have you got? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2373.0s)]
*  That's like math in Gaza. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2380.0s)]
*  And this is sick and we've known about it for years and it was tolerated for years by the Americans and all the other Westerners [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2383.0s)]
*  as we poured money into these corrupt organizations. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2389.0s)]
*  But it's not clear what you do about Gaza. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2392.0s)]
*  But why should this be Israel's problem alone? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2396.0s)]
*  If Washington doesn't have an answer for Gaza and Egypt doesn't and they don't want it back, and the rest of the world doesn't, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2400.0s)]
*  why would people keep on saying it's Israel's problem alone to solve? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2408.0s)]
*  Whatever happens in Gaza should be a regional agreement with regional investment, regional security deals. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2412.0s)]
*  But the absolute bottom line is never again will young Israelis have to lose their lives going into fight another conflict [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2421.0s)]
*  to get Iranian rockets that have come through Egypt out of Gaza. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2432.0s)]
*  This should be the last round. I said this at the beginning of this war. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2438.0s)]
*  Will this be the umpteenth Gaza war or the last one? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2442.0s)]
*  Will this be the third Lebanon war or the last one? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2446.0s)]
*  My hope is this is the last Gaza war. This is the last Lebanon war. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2450.0s)]
*  I want to go back to October of 2023 because there were two catastrophes of that week in October. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2455.0s)]
*  The first, of course, was the Hamas pogrom where 1,200 people were killed, more than 250 taken hostage, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2464.0s)]
*  many of whom are still in the terror tunnels deep beneath Gaza. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2472.0s)]
*  And the second was what started to happen and has continued to happen every day since October 8th, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2476.0s)]
*  which was the sight of some of the most well-educated people in the West taking to the streets, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2481.0s)]
*  waving Hamas flags, waving now Hezbollah flags, chanting glory to the martyrs. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2487.0s)]
*  And now you have, by the way, the same moment that we're sitting here. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2493.0s)]
*  I think today is the publication day of Ta-Nehisi Coates' new book, The Message, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2496.0s)]
*  which is based on a 10-day trip that he took to what he calls Palestine. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2502.0s)]
*  Well, it's quite interesting that Ta-Nehisi Coates for the first time in his life has decided to write [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2506.0s)]
*  about something other than his specialized subject, which is himself. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2510.0s)]
*  No, it's still about himself. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2514.0s)]
*  Oh, it is? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2516.0s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2517.0s)]
*  Because, I mean, this is somebody who wrote his first book, it was a memoir, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2518.0s)]
*  and it was about how incredibly prejudiced against he was. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2521.0s)]
*  My view, when your first book, and you have no public presence before, is a memoir, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2525.0s)]
*  it means you're doing pretty well in the publishing world. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2529.0s)]
*  If your second book is also a memoir, you're doing really well. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2531.0s)]
*  So, yeah, it's interesting that Coates should have applied himself to the most complex question [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2535.0s)]
*  in international geopolitics over a 10-day period, and utterly typical of him, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2541.0s)]
*  and he should probably get another MacArthur Genius grant. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2545.0s)]
*  Well, that's why I bring it up, right? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2547.0s)]
*  This is a person whose projects are produced by Oprah who has won pretty much every prize [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2549.0s)]
*  that there is to win in the Western world. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2555.0s)]
*  He won more prizes in the shorter space of time than Caitlyn Jenner. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2557.0s)]
*  Probably some of the same prizes, all those courage ones. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2560.0s)]
*  Well, he's won a lot, and he's going on television right now. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2564.0s)]
*  And, by the way, this book, for many young people, will be the only thing that they read [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2569.0s)]
*  about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, is what is contained in this book. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2574.0s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2577.0s)]
*  And so it's this strange split-screen reality that I want you to comment on, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2579.0s)]
*  because on the one hand, as you've said, you see a vision that's sort of emerging [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2583.0s)]
*  of a different Middle East that feels almost, you could say, hopeful, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2588.0s)]
*  despite the horrific, despite the horrors that have happened, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2593.0s)]
*  and the horrors that will surely happen in the coming days. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2599.0s)]
*  But on the other hand, it's a very different reality sitting here in America, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2602.0s)]
*  Coates' book being only one example of this phenomenon. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2606.0s)]
*  The reality is that there are people in this room who are students at Columbia University [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2610.0s)]
*  who lost their friends and their reputations and didn't get good grades [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2615.0s)]
*  because their professors knew that they supported the state of Israel. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2618.0s)]
*  That is now normative in American life to say nothing of the physical assaults [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2621.0s)]
*  that have happened to many people on college campuses and beyond that. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2626.0s)]
*  How do you square the maybe site of victory for Israel abroad [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2630.0s)]
*  and the reality for Jews here in America who always believed, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2636.0s)]
*  or at least since 1945 have believed, that this country was exceptional for us? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2641.0s)]
*  Talk to us a little bit about how you see ascendant anti-Semitism, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2645.0s)]
*  normalized anti-Semitism, and what can be done about it. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2650.0s)]
*  Well, one of the things I was very struck about in Israel after the seventh [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2655.0s)]
*  was delegations started to come through from America and Canada and Britain and elsewhere. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2659.0s)]
*  Delegations of Jews and Christians and others just trying to show support, really. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2664.0s)]
*  Often doing menial tasks like picking fruit in the south that needed picking and that sort of thing. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2670.0s)]
*  A large number of them I found would say things over dinner or over drink or whatever, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2678.0s)]
*  something along the following lines. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2684.0s)]
*  I was, I can't understand what's happened, Douglas. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2686.0s)]
*  I'm a liberal. I was there for me too. I was there for BLM. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2689.0s)]
*  And after the seventh no one was there for me. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2695.0s)]
*  And I always said the same thing, which was, welcome. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2699.0s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2704.0s)]
*  That was always going to be the case. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2706.0s)]
*  You're a fool to think that BLM didn't go the way it did, or that Occupy Wall Street wouldn't go. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2709.0s)]
*  Why do all these movements go to anti-Semitism straight away? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2715.0s)]
*  They're rancid movements. They're rancid movements based on half truths and lies. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2719.0s)]
*  And everything based on that will always fall into the supreme paranoid lie, which is anti-Semitism. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2725.0s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is a psychosis that human beings are very vulnerable to, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2735.0s)]
*  and the Jews' tragedy is that they provide such an easy excuse for people who are failing in their lives in all sorts of ways. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2741.0s)]
*  And as I have often said, you know, the amazing thing about anti-Semitism is [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2754.0s)]
*  the Jews can simultaneously be accused of being rich and of being poor, of being integrated and not integrating enough, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2758.0s)]
*  and of being stateless and of having a state. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2766.0s)]
*  But, you know, in a line I've been trying to popularize in the last year from Vasily Grossman, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2770.0s)]
*  everywhere it tells you nothing about the Jews. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2775.0s)]
*  What it tells you about is the person who suffers from anti-Semitism. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2778.0s)]
*  And as Grossman says, tell me what you accuse the Jews of, I'll tell you what you're guilty of. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2782.0s)]
*  Let me give you the supreme example of that. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2788.0s)]
*  The Arab world and the Muslim world accuses Israel of being a colonial state. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2791.0s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2799.0s)]
*  Islam is one of the great colonial projects in history. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2806.0s)]
*  In history, the Muslim world expanded through violent colonialism. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2812.0s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean that all Muslims approve of that or love it, but they certainly live in the history of that. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2818.0s)]
*  The Ottoman empires and all of these, these are all colonial movements. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2825.0s)]
*  Islam is a colonial movement. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2833.0s)]
*  They have the gall to say that the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2836.0s)]
*  where they existed long before Mohammed's mother came around, should be regarded as the colonial power. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2843.0s)]
*  This doesn't tell you anything about Israel. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2852.0s)]
*  It tells you about the Muslim and Arab world. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2854.0s)]
*  They are colonialists, so they accuse Israel of being colonialists. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2857.0s)]
*  But the case, the very, very interesting case, which all of the psychiatrists and psychologists in New York could not work out [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2862.0s)]
*  if you got them all together of the American student mind. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2871.0s)]
*  Well, that is very interesting. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2876.0s)]
*  And I'd say a couple of things. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2879.0s)]
*  The first is, they are, these are young people searching for a cause, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2882.0s)]
*  and they've been given a cause by wicked people. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2889.0s)]
*  And they'll have to decide in their lives what they think about that. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2894.0s)]
*  If you chant Intifada, you are chanting for something like the suicide bomber [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2900.0s)]
*  who went into a university in Jerusalem 20 years ago and detonated in the cafe, killing American students, among others. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2909.0s)]
*  Are you happy with that? Are you happy with that? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2917.0s)]
*  When you say you want the Intifada everywhere, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2921.0s)]
*  do you really mean you want your fellow students to be blown up whilst buying a cappuccino? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2925.0s)]
*  Really? Like, have you thought about this at all? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2932.0s)]
*  Are you this morally frivolous or wicked? [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2937.0s)]
*  So, these are, by the way, and these are people who have joined a losing side. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2942.0s)]
*  This is very important to stress. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2948.0s)]
*  They've joined a losing side. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2950.0s)]
*  They have joined a death cult. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2952.0s)]
*  They have joined a death cult. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2954.0s)]
*  They celebrate a death cult. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2957.0s)]
*  When they celebrate and reiterate mottos shouted by Hamas and Hezbollah, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2959.0s)]
*  they should know that the people they're shouting support for are in the dust now. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2965.0s)]
*  I suppose some of these people have got fed up of sending wreaths by now. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2970.0s)]
*  Maybe they should have loyalty cards with Intiflora. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2975.0s)]
*  Send flowers to all of the people they worshiped who are no more. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2978.0s)]
*  Their horrible belief is going the way that anti-Semitic death cults have gone throughout history. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2983.0s)]
*  There is a reason why people abhor the Nazis. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2993.0s)]
*  They were the same type of people, and they were ground into the dust of history. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=2998.0s)]
*  Hamas, Hezbollah, the mullahs will go as well. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3005.0s)]
*  And these young people who decided to spend their formative years fasting [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3010.0s)]
*  or shitting into a bucket in the middle of Columbia University [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3017.0s)]
*  while saying they were doing it for Hamas, well done, guys, well done. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3021.0s)]
*  Your movement was less fragrant than it seemed. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3029.0s)]
*  Those people who are shouting Intiflora are not thinking of the people murdered in the Hebrew cafeteria. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3033.0s)]
*  They're thinking, I was told this is what it means to be on the right side of history. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3043.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. They were told they were on the right side of history [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3048.0s)]
*  as they were chasing Jews across campus shouting, go back to Poland. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3052.0s)]
*  Do you think you might have been the bad guys? You think? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3055.0s)]
*  What do we do about the fact, though, that this is one of a lot of alarming statistics? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3061.0s)]
*  Fifty-one percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 24, all of them with an IV right into TikTok, I'm sure, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3067.0s)]
*  said that Israel believed that Israel should be ended and given to Hamas and to the Palestinians. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3074.0s)]
*  Just as a practical matter, we can sit here and say, haha, they're shitting in buckets, haha, they're idiots. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3080.0s)]
*  That's the next generation of American citizens. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3085.0s)]
*  How do we, what do we do about that? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3090.0s)]
*  Well, the first thing is, um, we should pray they never get what they want. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3093.0s)]
*  Pray they never get what they want. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3101.0s)]
*  If they got what they wanted for and what they chant for, they would end up waking up and rising that they were the Nazis. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3104.0s)]
*  Hamas, Hezbollah, the regime in Tehran, this is no overstatement for once, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3110.0s)]
*  which is to finish the work of Adolf Hitler in our time. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3119.0s)]
*  If they managed, if Iran got the nuclear bomb and the Ayatollahs used it, that's it. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3124.0s)]
*  And the Jewish people who survived Pharaoh and the Babylonians and the Assyrians and the Romans and Mengele would have been done in in our own time. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3134.0s)]
*  Are you sure you'd be happy to live with that, young Columbia student? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3147.0s)]
*  So no, I mean, I pray that they never, for many reasons, that they never get what they say they want. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3154.0s)]
*  But I think one of the alarming lessons of the past decade or at least one lesson I'm learning, I'm sure you knew it years before me, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3161.0s)]
*  is I always used to comfort myself in a certain sense by saying, people grow out of it. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3169.0s)]
*  People grow out of it. And I don't feel that way anymore. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3174.0s)]
*  I don't see people just naturally growing out of something that is being reinforced by so many of the institutions in their lives, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3179.0s)]
*  by the people they admire, not just by their professors, but by many people in the culture who let these lies go unchallenged. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3189.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, as I say, there's a lot of rot in the culture. There's a lot of rot in the institution. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3196.0s)]
*  You said earlier that we're kind of drunk on peace, or the way a lot of other people have said it is we're a decadent society. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3201.0s)]
*  Is it going to take something catastrophic happening to us? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3208.0s)]
*  It will take a mass casualty terror attack, probably. Probably, sadly. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3211.0s)]
*  You know, there's a line from T.S. Eliot, a rather sobering line in Murder in the Cathedral, where he says, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3220.0s)]
*  we do not know very much about the future except from generation to generation. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3228.0s)]
*  We do the same thing again and again. Men learn little. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3234.0s)]
*  And yeah, I think that most likely a mass casualty terror attack would be about the only thing that would bring the reality of this home. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3240.0s)]
*  I mean, if these students, if these students who do this, if they realize that they had any imagination, if they had any sympathy or empathy, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3252.0s)]
*  can they imagine that? Of course they can't imagine. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3259.0s)]
*  Imagine that the Nova Party had taken place in New York. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3261.0s)]
*  Imagine that at 6.30 in the morning, rockets started to land over your head. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3270.0s)]
*  Imagine within about 20 minutes, big bearded men with machine guns and Kalashnikovs and grenades [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3276.0s)]
*  came and raped your friends in front of you and then killed them in front of you and then came for you next. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3286.0s)]
*  And in your last moments, that was what you saw. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3291.0s)]
*  One of the, without getting too gruesome, but let me just perhaps do so for once to hit home the point, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3295.0s)]
*  one of the people who I interviewed who had been in the Nova Party had said at one point that the, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3301.0s)]
*  there was a young girl on her knees, the one that the Hamas terrorists had killed, her best friend in front of her, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3312.0s)]
*  and they were debating whether or not they should take her into Gaza or kill her. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3319.0s)]
*  And she was screaming, please don't kill me, please don't kill me. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3326.0s)]
*  And they shot her through the face and she was still shouting that when her face fell off. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3329.0s)]
*  That's what these guys are. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3340.0s)]
*  Does any student in America understand this or can have any understanding that this, these people would do that to them? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3342.0s)]
*  My prayer is that they don't, that they're simply lacking in imagination. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3352.0s)]
*  But if this happened to them, and if this happened to them and they, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3361.0s)]
*  like the Nova survivors came to New York for an exhibition about the Nova Party, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3366.0s)]
*  and then they find in the streets of New York outside the exhibit American students and others chanting support for the people who did this to their friends, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3370.0s)]
*  I don't know how some of these, they're so brave, these young people, to still be going around the world telling their story. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3381.0s)]
*  When they go around much of the world and they meet people they tell their story to who are supporting the people who did it. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3387.0s)]
*  This is a level of human evil, I don't think that, human lack of empathy perhaps I can say, that is beyond my comprehension. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3395.0s)]
*  I just want to say one other thing on that. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3408.0s)]
*  We have seen something like this before. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3410.0s)]
*  We saw it in the 60s and 70s when part of the left in Europe decided to take up the cause of the PLO. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3413.0s)]
*  You know very interestingly, one of the things about the Entebbe raid that people don't realize is that two of the hijackers were members of the German left. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3421.0s)]
*  One of them used to live with former Foreign Minister Schröder. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3432.0s)]
*  And they had decided after World War II there was one thing they wouldn't be, which was they wouldn't be Nazis. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3437.0s)]
*  And this is quite a good idea. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3443.0s)]
*  It's a good orienting principle, you know, don't be Nazis. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3445.0s)]
*  But I just want to stress that even that isn't enough on its own, not with other moral cause to you, not with other things in your system. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3453.0s)]
*  Because by the 60s, the PLO and all those groups, some of the German left fell into that. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3466.0s)]
*  And one of the things about the Entebbe hijacking, which is not well enough known, is that when the plane was landed in Uganda, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3475.0s)]
*  the main hijacker, the German left, sorted out the passengers, Jews and non-Jews. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3488.0s)]
*  Jews and non-Jews. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3496.0s)]
*  Now it wasn't just Israelis and non-Israelis. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3498.0s)]
*  They got the American Jews into the line with the other Jews. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3501.0s)]
*  And there was a man on the plane, as in Entebbe, one of several people on the plane who was a Holocaust survivor. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3507.0s)]
*  And as he heard this German left winger shouting orders to the Jews after the selection process, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3513.0s)]
*  he showed his tattoo from the camp and said, I had thought that people had changed. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3522.0s)]
*  And the hijacker has been quoted by several people present as having said to that man, I'm not a Nazi. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3529.0s)]
*  I'm an idealist. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3537.0s)]
*  We've seen these people before, but we've seen them off before. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3544.0s)]
*  I wondered before we go to questions, you've met so many people in your time in Israel. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3550.0s)]
*  You've talked to survivors. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3559.0s)]
*  You've gone to jails where terrorists are being held. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3561.0s)]
*  You've, of course, met with so many political leaders. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3565.0s)]
*  You shared an image I don't think any of us will ever forget about what happened to the woman on her knees at the NOVA Festival. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3570.0s)]
*  And I think each one of us in this room has different images that we go back to. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3577.0s)]
*  I wondered if you could give us a different kind of image, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3582.0s)]
*  because one of the things you talked about when you recently won the Alexander Hamilton Award is you've said that your friends have commented to you [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3586.0s)]
*  that you've changed since October 7th, and the way that you've changed is that you're actually less pessimistic. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3594.0s)]
*  So tell us some give us some reasons that you've left some of that pessimism behind, maybe through maybe through some people that you've met. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3601.0s)]
*  Well, the real thing, you know, is that. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3610.0s)]
*  One of the first times I was in Israel, I had a very rather personal feeling. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3621.0s)]
*  I've actually said this before, but there was rocketing in the north and I hadn't been under any serious bombardment before. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3627.0s)]
*  I'd seen stuff in Iraq and elsewhere. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3637.0s)]
*  And I remember coming back from a day in the north where there's been rocketing, as there was again recently in the town of Safad. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3640.0s)]
*  And I thought something very strange when I got home, which was I thought I could look my grandparents in the face. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3649.0s)]
*  And what I mean by that is for my generation in Britain, it was always the question, would we be able to do what our grandparents had done? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3662.0s)]
*  You know, living through the blitz in London night after night and not losing their faith and not losing their strength. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3674.0s)]
*  And I used to hear stories of that terrible stories when I was growing up of what that was like and from those who went and fought, the ones who didn't come back. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3686.0s)]
*  And in my country of birth, Great Britain, like in America, every country is filled with family stories. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3697.0s)]
*  My grandmother on my father's side lost her father in the first war and then her brothers in the second and always fighting the Germans. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3704.0s)]
*  And every family was like that. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3713.0s)]
*  It was always this question of if the time of trial came, would we be up to it? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3717.0s)]
*  And that was what just in my small little way that day, I remember thinking. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3725.0s)]
*  I got a little taste of what my forebears went through, tiniest one. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3730.0s)]
*  But everyone in the West, somewhere in our back of our heads, has this thing. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3736.0s)]
*  And Israelis had it always. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3742.0s)]
*  And, you know, there was always a thing since 1973 in particular, in the first, the second, the first and the second world war. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3745.0s)]
*  Always this question of are the young people going to be up to it? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3752.0s)]
*  And just I have so much admiration and pride and so much more that this generation of young Israelis were put to the test and they've been magnificent. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3757.0s)]
*  And if you see what these young men and women do on a daily basis from the south of Gaza to the mountains of Lebanon and Syria in the north, and they don't do any of it with hatred in their hearts. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3773.0s)]
*  They don't. Some of what they have to do. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3790.0s)]
*  I mean, just some of what they've had to do is just beyond description. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3793.0s)]
*  But they do it from love of their country, love of their people, love of their tradition, defense of their people, defense of their tradition. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3800.0s)]
*  They know that they are fighting for the Jewish people as their forebears have before, but this time with a state, with an army, with an air force. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3812.0s)]
*  And they've stepped up to this moment and they have been extraordinary. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3822.0s)]
*  People will write books about this generation. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3828.0s)]
*  And I just say it is the best thing about it is that it should tell us that there is also a better way. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3831.0s)]
*  There is a better way than this nihilism and hatred which has been bred in America. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3841.0s)]
*  There is something else other than this culture of resentment and failure. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3849.0s)]
*  And it is failure. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3855.0s)]
*  There is something better than this culture of grievance and I don't have enough or someone else must have something. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3857.0s)]
*  As Ronald Reagan said once, this idea that if there's a fat man standing by the side of a thin man, it must mean the fat man took something from the thin man. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3864.0s)]
*  There is something else than this thing that has ended up in the last year being a celebration of a death cult. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3872.0s)]
*  There is such a thing as gratitude instead of resentment, pride instead of envy, and pride in the real sense, pride in something you should be proud of, pride in protecting your people and your faith and your community, and indeed in my view the civilized world. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3883.0s)]
*  So I've just met, I can't even begin listing the number of people, but anyone who feels down from spending too much time with people in America should come to Israel. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3901.0s)]
*  And you will see that among other things the people who thought the next generation of Israelis just wanted to party were wrong. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3919.0s)]
*  And it turned out not to be an either or thing. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3928.0s)]
*  You can fight for your country and your people and you can still dance. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3932.0s)]
*  And that's what they're showing. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3luFEvjIY&t=3936.0s)]
