We go to Memphis for an update after jurors acquitted three former Memphis police officers of the murder of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black father who died after the officers brutally beat him during a traffic stop in January 2023. The group beating was caught on video, provoking widespread outrage and calls for police reform. The three officers still face sentencing after they were convicted of separate federal charges, along with two other officers who pleaded guilty to the state charges and will not stand trial. "A lot of us were shocked," says Amber Sherman, of the Memphis community's response. Sherman, a community organizer and member of Black Lives Matter Memphis, joined the family Thursday at a community vigil and protest. She warns this latest acquittal will "embolden" Memphis police as they continue to "do whatever they want."

*  Welcome back to Democracy Now!, Amber. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  You were out there with the family yesterday as people held a memorial vigil and protests. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=45.82s)]
*  Can you respond to the jury's acquittal of the three officers, not to say they won't [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=51.84s)]
*  serve time in jail because there were also federal charges that they faced, along with [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  other officers? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=61.84s)]
*  Yeah, thank you for having me. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=62.84s)]
*  I think that a lot of us were shocked. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=66.88000000000001s)]
*  I thought they would at least be found guilty on a few charges, but boy, did they prove [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=69.2s)]
*  me wrong. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=74.2s)]
*  I was like, OK, never mind then. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=75.2s)]
*  But I do feel like them being found guilty on all of the charges really does embolden [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=78.6s)]
*  the Memphis Police Department. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=83.0s)]
*  So they're like, never did any of you have to say they're acquitted of all the charges. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=84.0s)]
*  Yeah, acquitted. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=87.0s)]
*  Yeah, it really emboldens them to just feel like they can do whatever they want, and they [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=88.0s)]
*  can really just leave their body cameras on. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=94.32s)]
*  It doesn't even matter, because if you see it on camera, they're still going to find [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=95.8s)]
*  you not guilty of the charges, and you'll be acquitted. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=99.88s)]
*  And can you remind our audience what happened to Tyree when he was just stopped for a traffic stop? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=103.0s)]
*  Yeah, so Tyree was stopped by the Scorpion Unit, which is a type of task force here in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=111.96s)]
*  Memphis. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=118.0s)]
*  That task force has since been disbanded, but there's a similar task force that exists [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=119.0s)]
*  still. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=122.8s)]
*  So they're still doing these types of stops where they are targeting people in certain [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=123.8s)]
*  types of cars, in certain neighborhoods, specifically black neighborhoods, because they said that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=127.0s)]
*  they want to target high crime areas. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=131.88s)]
*  But the area that he was in had only had one homicide in the entire year before. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=133.72s)]
*  So to me, it looks like they're targeting black people in black neighborhoods. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=138.4s)]
*  And he was stopped by an officer. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  He was immediately yanked out of his car and yelled at. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=144.04s)]
*  He's asking them why they're stopping him. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=146.84s)]
*  They don't tell him anything. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  They started hitting him. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=150.44s)]
*  Their body cameras were still on at that point. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=152.12s)]
*  And then at some point, he is able to escape them from beating him and runs down the street [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=154.84s)]
*  towards his house. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=159.4s)]
*  And then they find him on a corner at Castle Gate and Ross, which is in Memphis and East [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=160.88s)]
*  Memphis. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=166.04s)]
*  And there's a sky cam above him, which are these cameras that the police department used [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=167.04s)]
*  to surveil our neighborhoods, actually. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=170.84s)]
*  But this sky cam actually had AI technology that helped the camera to move around. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=173.08s)]
*  So it actually moves as they're beating him. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=177.0s)]
*  And you can see from multiple angles that multiple officers are kicking him in the head. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  They're hitting him in the body. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=184.32s)]
*  They tried to spray him with pepper spray, but sprayed themselves. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=185.96s)]
*  So then they get even more angrier and continue to hit him. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=188.68s)]
*  And he is at one point just lifeless, laying there, just being hit. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=191.92s)]
*  And they're using all the excuses in the world about how, you know, this is their training [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=196.0s)]
*  and he was resisting. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=199.24s)]
*  But you can clearly see on video that he's not. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=201.16s)]
*  I just want to say that the former officers, Tudorius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=203.4s)]
*  Smith, were found not guilty of murder in the state trial. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=208.6s)]
*  But in a separate federal case, they were found guilty of witness tampering and await [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=212.16s)]
*  sentencing for that conviction. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=216.12s)]
*  And two others were also convicted on the federal charge and pleaded guilty to state [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=217.64s)]
*  charges will avoid trial. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=222.72s)]
*  But they are all possibly expected to serve time in prison. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=225.0s)]
*  In this last minute that we have, Amber, the response of the family at what they're calling [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=229.04s)]
*  for at this point? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=235.68s)]
*  Well, I just want to also add that Demetrius Haley was found guilty of excessive force, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=237.28s)]
*  deliberate interference for medical intervention and witness tampering, not just witness tampering. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=244.0s)]
*  And he's facing up to life in federal prison. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=248.12s)]
*  Well, Amber Sherman, I want to thank you so much for being with us. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozA_ksQb-Q&t=251.08s)]
