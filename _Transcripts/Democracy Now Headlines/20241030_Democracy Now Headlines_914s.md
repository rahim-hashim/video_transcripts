# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” October 30, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbD5pw10yro)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The World Food Program is calling for immediate action to prevent famine in the Gaza Strip,
*  warning Palestinians across the besieged territory are losing hope of finding any food for their
*  starving children.
*  The aid agency said Tuesday it has nearly 100,000 tons of food ready for shipment from
*  Egypt and Jordan, enough to feed a million Palestinians for four months, but that Israel
*  has largely denied access to convoys.
*  The situation is most dire in northern Gaza, where the Israeli army has blocked all aid
*  access for a 25th consecutive day.
*  This comes amidst dire warnings from aid organizations over Israel's decision to ban the U.N. relief
*  agency UNRWA.
*  On Tuesday, the U.N. humanitarian office called the policy collective punishment, a
*  war crime, while UNICEF spokesperson James Older warned of a complete collapse of Gaza's
*  humanitarian system.
*  You take away the healthcare workers.
*  You take away the nutritional support.
*  You take away the people who will provide the lifesaving supplies for a population that
*  is physically, physically, absolutely on death's door and psychologically, of course, in uncharted
*  territory.
*  You take away these healthcare workers.
*  You take away the nutritionists.
*  Then we will see many more children die.
*  On Tuesday, Israel's military once again bombed residential buildings in Beit Lechiyah,
*  killing at least 19 Palestinians hours after a separate attack, killed at least 93 people,
*  including 25 children.
*  Beit Lechiyah in northern Gaza has been declared a disaster area amidst weeks of relentless
*  Israeli bombings and military siege.
*  Meanwhile, a new report by the research group Forensic Architecture finds Israel is systematically
*  committing crimes of persecution and destruction in Gaza, amounting to genocide.
*  The group found Israel's destroyed over 83 percent of all plant life in Gaza, over
*  70 percent of agricultural land, nearly half of all groundwater wells and two-thirds of
*  water tanks.
*  Of Gaza's 36 hospitals, Israel's forced 35 to stop service at least once, targeted
*  31 in bombings and attacks and violently invaded 10 hospitals.
*  In Lebanon, residents of the city of Baalbek in the Beqaa Valley rushed to flee their homes
*  and businesses today after Israel's military ordered them to leave the city and surrounding
*  villages.
*  The panicked forced displacement came after two days of stepped-up attacks by Israel,
*  killed at least 60 people in Baalbek.
*  Lebanon's Health Ministry reports Israeli strikes on Tuesday killed at least 77 people
*  across Lebanon.
*  Among the dead are 10 people, mostly women and children, killed when Israel bombed a
*  residential block in the town of Sarrafand.
*  In the occupied West Bank, lawyers for Marwan Barghouti say the longtime Palestinian political
*  prisoner was assaulted by Israeli guards as he was held in solitary confinement.
*  The beating in early September reportedly left Barghouti with numerous injuries to his
*  bloody ear that later became infected due to medical neglect.
*  Barghouti's lawyers say he was previously subjected to at least two other attacks by
*  Israeli prison guards.
*  Marwan Barghouti is the most high-profile Palestinian in Israeli detention, who many
*  have described as the Palestinian Nelson Mandela.
*  Diplomats from Norway said Tuesday they're preparing a U.N. General Assembly resolution
*  asking the International Court of Justice to rule on whether Israel's siege of the
*  Gaza Strip violates international law.
*  On Tuesday, U.S. envoy to the United Nations, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the
*  U.N. Security Council Israel must allow food, medicine and other supplies into all of Gaza.
*  The United States has made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that one year into this
*  conflict, Israel must address the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza, that the United
*  States rejects any Israeli efforts to starve Palestinians in Jabalia or anywhere else,
*  and that Israel's words must be matched by action on the ground.
*  Palestinian ambassador to the U.N., Riyad Mansour, called on U.N. Security Council members
*  to match their words with actions saying stop this genocide or forever remain silent.
*  The entire population of North Gaza is at risk of dying. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians
*  are at risk of imminent death, faced with the death penalty for refusing to leave their
*  land.
*  Sudan's paramilitary rapid support forces have committed staggering levels of sexual
*  violence, raping civilians and kidnapping women as sex slaves, which may amount to war
*  crimes and crimes against humanity. That's according to a new report by a U.N. fact-finding
*  mission. Sudan's 18-month war between the RSF and Sudanese military has uprooted more
*  than 14 million people, the world's largest displacement crisis. U.N. experts are calling
*  on the International Criminal Court to expand its jurisdiction and investigate possible
*  war crimes committed beyond the region of Darfur. A previous U.N. mission said both
*  the RSF and Sudanese army may be guilty of atrocities committed during the conflict.
*  This is Amy Pope, director general of the International Organization for Migration,
*  speaking from Port Sudan.
*  The situation here is simply catastrophic. There's no other way to put it. We're
*  using hunger, disease, sexual violence. They're rampant. And for the people of Sudan, they're
*  telling us it's really just a living nightmare.
*  In Mozambique, opposition leader Venancio Mondelain is calling on supporters to join
*  him in another wave of protests in the capital Maputo following days of deadly clashes with
*  police. Mozambique authorities have unleashed a brutal crackdown on protesters who've
*  taken to the streets over allegations of fraud in the October 9 presidential and parliamentary
*  elections, Mozambique's debt crisis, corruption and other issues. Human Rights Watch reports
*  Mozambique armed forces have killed at least 11 protesters, leaving dozens more injured.
*  Here in the United States, Kamala Harris has delivered the last major speech of her campaign
*  for the presidency. On Tuesday, the vice president rallied tens of thousands of supporters on
*  the national wall on the ellipse for a closing argument, which she called herself a protector
*  of U.S. democracy and warned of the threat of a second Trump term.
*  Those who came before us, the patriots at Normandy and Selma, Seneca Falls and Stonewall,
*  on farmlands and factory floors, they did not struggle, sacrifice and live in the same
*  way that they did in the last election. They laid down their lives only to see us seed
*  our fundamental freedoms. They didn't do that only to see us submit to the will of
*  another petty tyrant. Harris spoke from the ellipse, the same venue
*  where on January 6, 2021, Trump incited a mob of supporters to attack the capital to
*  disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's electoral college victory.
*  Harris's campaign said 75,000 people attended Tuesday night's event, significantly larger
*  than Trump's rally ahead of the insurrection. Donald Trump spent much of Tuesday seeking
*  to control fallout from his racist Madison Square Garden rally Sunday, in which far-right
*  so-called comic Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a quote, floating island of garbage in
*  the middle of the ocean, unquote. The New York Times described the rally as a closing
*  carnival of grievances, misogyny and racism. On Tuesday, Trump called his Madison Square
*  Garden rally a love fest. There's never been an event so beautiful.
*  It was like a love fest, an absolute love fest, and it was my honor to be involved.
*  Trump's former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former presidential opponent, who endorsed
*  Trump at the Republican National Convention after unsuccessfully challenging him for the
*  nomination, criticized Trump and the campaign for its attacks on Puerto Ricans and warned
*  its overly masculine message is turning off women voters. Haley was speaking on Fox News.
*  They need to go and tell Puerto Ricans how much, you know, they do value them. They need
*  to tell Latinos that. But they also need to look at how they're talking about women.
*  I mean, this bromance and this masculinity stuff, I mean, it borders on edgy to the point
*  that it's going to make women uncomfortable. Meanwhile, President Biden's clarified his
*  remarks condemning the racist comments made at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally.
*  On Tuesday, Biden told Voto Latino, quote, The only garbage I see floating out there
*  is his supporters, unquote. Trump's backers seized on the remarks, comparing them to Hillary
*  Clinton's 2016 comment calling Trump supporters a basket of deplorables. On social media,
*  President Biden wrote, quote, His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all
*  I meant to say, he said. He said he was only talking about the people speaking at the Madison
*  Square Garden rally. A group of 82 U.S. Nobel Prize winners have signed an open letter endorsing
*  Kamala Harris for president, arguing a Trump presidency would, quote, jeopardize any advancements
*  in our standards of living, slow the progress of science and technology and impede our responses
*  to climate change, they wrote. Meanwhile, more than a thousand religious leaders across
*  the U.S. have offered a joint endorsement of Harris. Reverend Dr. Bernice King, daughter
*  of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said, quote, Harris will provide us the opportunity to
*  preserve our democracy and rule of law as we continue the people's fight to create
*  a just, humane and equitable society, unquote. Reverend King added, quote, A vote for Kamala
*  Harris is not an endorsement of U.S. funding for the war on Gaza, unquote. Meanwhile, Vermont
*  Independent Senator Bernie Sanders has released a video urging supporters to vote for Harris
*  in what he called the most consequential election in our lifetimes. Sanders cited Harris's
*  positions on reproductive rights, wealth, inequality and the climate crisis.
*  And some of you are saying, how can I vote for Kamala Harris if she is supporting this
*  terrible war? And that is a very fair question. And let me give you my best answer. And that
*  is that even on this issue, Donald Trump and his right-wing friends are worse.
*  President Trump's former top political adviser, Steve Bannon, was released from a federal
*  prison Tuesday after completing a four-month sentence on charges of contempt of Congress.
*  In 2022, a jury found Bannon guilty of defying congressional subpoenas related to the January
*  6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. Shortly after his release, Bannon held a news conference
*  in New York City where he was interrupted by the comic Rob Bratilo, who disguised himself
*  as a MAGA supporter. Steve, Robbie Rode-Steamer here. I'm wondering
*  when's the next insurrection and can we storm the Burger King after this?
*  Bannon still faces criminal charges in New York for allegedly defrauding donors to an
*  anti-immigrant nonprofit called We Build the Wall, defrauding them out of more than $15
*  million and laundering the proceeds. That trial is set to begin December 9.
*  At least 51 people have been killed in regions across southern and eastern Spain, including
*  the region of Valencia, after torrential rains triggered devastating floods, leaving entire
*  roads and towns underwater. Officials said the death toll is likely to grow as search
*  and rescue efforts continue. More than a month's worth of rain fell in less than 24 hours in
*  some areas of southern and eastern Spain, with authorities saying this is one of the
*  worst natural disasters to hit Spain in recent years.
*  In India, air pollution around the national capital of Delhi has soared to 30 times the
*  World Health Organization's recommended limit. Officials blame the worsening climate
*  crisis paired with vehicle emissions and widespread crop stubble burning in neighboring states.
*  There's so much pollution in Delhi that we cannot even breathe properly. I have been
*  ill for four days due to pollution. There is breathlessness and continuous coughing.
*  More than one-third of the world's trees may be facing mass extinction due to deforestation
*  and global heating from human activity. The findings were announced Monday at the United
*  Nations Biodiversity Conference, known as COP16, which is underway in Cali, Colombia.
*  This is the first comprehensive assessment on the status of tree species published by
*  the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, which warns more than 16
*  of the 47,000 tree species analyzed in the report are at risk of going extinct, threatening
*  thousands of other species of plants, animals and fungi that rely on forest ecosystems to
*  survive. IUCN Director-General Gretel Aguilar said in a statement, quote,
*  "'Trees are the barometer of life. Can you imagine a planet without trees? We humans
*  are capable to reverse this and save these trees that we depend on. The task that we
*  have is huge,' they said." And those are some of the headlines. This is Democracy Now!,
