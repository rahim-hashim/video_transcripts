*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  More than 400 people have been detained in Russia for publicly mourning the death of
*  Alexei Navalny, who reportedly died in an Arctic prison Friday at the age of 47.
*  Navalny was Russia's most prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin.
*  He was serving a 19-year sentence at the time of his death, which President Biden and a
*  number of other Western leaders directly blamed on Putin.
*  Navalny's mother, who traveled to the Arctic town of Harp, was denied access to her son's
*  body and was told by prison authorities Navalny died of sudden death syndrome.
*  Keri Amish, a spokesperson for Navalny, spoke on Saturday.
*  KERI AMISH, Russian President, The War and Peace Report.
*  Alexei was a symbol of hope and a symbol of courage for many Russian people.
*  And now they feel like this idea of hope abandoned them.
*  But that's not true.
*  And I'm sure that people will find strength to continue their fight,
*  because this is what Alexei always wanted and this is what he was telling everyone all the time,
*  even from the prison.
*  Amnesty International Secretary-General Agnès Kayamard called for an international probe into
*  Navalny's death.
*  Look, the international community need to react with the strongest way possible,
*  but we know that actions have very little impact right now on Putin and on Russia.
*  But still, silence is not an option.
*  We must stand up, and the international political leaders around the world must make a stronger
*  statement as possible.
*  They must demand investigations.
*  They must, in fact, investigate his unlawful death themselves.
*  We must call on the United Nations to investigate that death, that unlawful death, that killing,
*  in fact.
*  We'll speak to Russian-American journalist Masha Gessen.
*  Masha's new piece for The New Yorker has headlined the death of Alexei Navalny,

*  Health Organization amidst a days-long Israeli raid on the facility.

*  After here, where can I go?

*  mass-coordinated action against the war on Gaza. Students are continuing to organize,
*  despite what they say are attempts by school administrators to intimidate and censor them.

*  where our institution's complicity with Zionism has been made loud and clear.
*  We recognize our responsibility to the people of Gaza and stand in unwavering solidarity with them.
*  In Israel, thousands took to the streets of Tel Aviv Saturday night to demand an immediate
*  election to replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government.
*  Outside of Tel Aviv's military headquarters, another major protest called on Netanyahu to
