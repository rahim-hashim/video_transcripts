# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” June 17, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChECUVhHY9g)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The United Nations, warning more than 50,000 Palestinian children in Gaza, require immediate
*  medical treatment for acute malnutrition.
*  In a statement, the U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees said the situation in Gaza is catastrophic
*  as residents continue to face desperate levels of hunger.
*  Homes across the world today are marking the holy day of Eid al-Adha, but it is a day
*  of mourning in Gaza, where the death toll from Israel's war has topped 37,300.
*  How are we supposed to be happy on Eid?
*  While every day there are martyrs, wounded people every minute, every second, there are
*  no houses.
*  This area used to be the best area in Khan Yunus.
*  Now it's all destruction and rubble.
*  Now our biggest dream is to live in a house.
*  There are no houses and no life.
*  Life has been diminished.
*  A new investigation by the Associated Press has revealed at least 60 Palestinian families
*  have lost 25 or more family members in Israel's ongoing war.
*  In some cases, entire bloodlines of families have been killed.
*  AP highlights the story of Yusef Salem.
*  173 of his relatives were killed in Israeli airstrikes in December.
*  About 100 more members of his family have died since then.
*  Yusef Salem told the AP, quote,
*  "...my uncles were wiped out totally, the heads of households, their wives, children
*  and grandchildren," unquote.
*  In more news from Gaza, aid shipments are no longer coming in by sea to Gaza.
*  The U.S. military has temporarily removed the pier it just built due to rough seas at
*  the cost of over $300 million, the building of that pier.
*  This comes just over a week after the pier was reattached after the first pier was damaged
*  in a storm.
*  Meanwhile, on Sunday, Israel announced it would pause attacks along an aid route in
*  southern Gaza during daylight hours, but the head of INROS says operationally nothing has
*  changed in southern Gaza.
*  Israel's announcement came a day after fighters from Hamas killed eight Israeli soldiers in
*  in an ambush.
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved Israel's war cabinet following
*  the recent resignation of former military chief Benny Gantz.
*  This comes as mass protests continue in Israel, calling for the government to support a ceasefire
*  and hostage deal and for new elections.
*  Tens of thousands of people protested in Tel Aviv Saturday.
*  Several groups have vowed to intensify their protests by launching what they call a week
*  of resistance.
*  Here in the United States, Democratic Congressmember Ro Khanna of California has announced he'll
*  join other lawmakers and boycott Netanyahu's upcoming speech to Congress.
*  The Biden administration has placed sanctions on a far-right Israeli group that's been
*  attacking Gaza-bound humanitarian aid trucks in the West Bank.
*  In May, members of the group Tzav 9 set fire to two aid trucks and looted the aid of about
*  the trucks.
*  In other news from the occupied West Bank, Norway's foreign minister has warned the
*  Palestinian Authority could collapse in the coming months due to a lack of funding.
*  In a 6-3 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court has struck down a ban on bump stocks, accessories
*  that turn semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15 into fully automatic machine guns.
*  The Trump administration issued the ban in 2018 after a gunman opened fire at a concert
*  in Las Vegas, killing 58 people in one of the country's deadliest mass shootings ever.
*  In the majority opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote, quote,
*  "'We hold that a semi-automatic rifle equipped with a bump stock is not a machine gun because
*  it cannot fire more than one shot by a single function of the trigger,' unquote.
*  The court's three liberal judges dissented.
*  Justice Sonia Sotomayor summarized her dissent from the bench, saying, quote,
*  "'The majority puts machine guns back in civilian hands.
*  When I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, quacks like a duck, I call
*  that bird a duck,' she said.
*  Survivors of the 2017 Las Vegas massacre decried the Supreme Court decision."
*  I'm not going to let our children continue to die.
*  You know, that's my biggest push, is that as an adult, I am stuck with this trauma and
*  this fear for the rest of my life.
*  My children should not have to live this way.
*  You know, we don't have to live this way, and we don't have to die this way.
*  In related news, a gunman in Rochester Hills, Michigan, opened fire at a splash pad on Saturday
*  afternoon.
*  Nine people were injured, including two children and a pregnant woman.
*  The victims ranged in age from 4 to 78.
*  A semi-automatic handgun was found at the scene.
*  The suspected gunman was later found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.
*  The shooting occurred in the same county as the 2021 mass shooting at Oxford High School
*  that left four students dead.
*  More than 90 countries participated in a two-day conference in Switzerland to discuss ways
*  to end Russia's war in Ukraine, but Russia wasn't invited to attend the talks.
*  Most of the countries attending signed a joint communique stating the, quote, "'territorial
*  of Ukraine' must be the basis of any peace deal."
*  Ahead of the talks, Russian President Vladimir Putin put forward his own ceasefire proposal
*  that involved Ukraine dropping its ambitions to join NATO and to hand over areas of Ukraine
*  claimed by Moscow.
*  Speaking in Switzerland, Vice President Kamala Harris criticized Putin's offer.
*  And let nothing about the end of this war be decided without Ukraine.
*  By contrast, however, yesterday Putin put forward a proposal.
*  But we must speak truth.
*  He is not calling for negotiations.
*  He is calling for surrender.
*  The U.N. is imploring the international community to pay more attention to the unfolding humanitarian
*  catastrophe in Sudan, where the war that broke out last April has killed at least 14,000
*  over 10 million could result in millions of famine-related deaths.
*  Humanitarian groups project three-quarters of a million people could face catastrophic
*  food shortages by September, while some analysts say the death toll could end up in the millions.
*  This comes amidst ongoing deadly battles in El Fasher, as the Rapid Support Forces try
*  to seize the last city in Darfur outside its control.
*  Over 220 people have been killed in recent fighting.
*  This week, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution calling on the RSF to immediately
*  halt its attack on El Fasher.
*  In France, leftist parties announced a new alliance ahead of snap elections later this
*  month.
*  French President Emmanuel Macron called the surprise June 30 vote after suffering a major
*  defeat to the far-right national rally at the EU elections.
*  Leaders of the newly formed New Popular Front joined mass protests against the rise of the
*  far-right in Paris Saturday, vowing a complete break with Macron's policies.
*  Popular mobilization is the key to fight against the extreme right and to beat the extreme
*  right.
*  We say regularly that the European elections mark the after-Macron period.
*  The United States is driving a global surge in spending on nuclear weapons.
*  The international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons reports global spending on nukes jumped
*  13 percent to over $91 billion last year.
*  The United States spent over $51 billion modernizing its nuclear arsenal.
*  That's more money than all of the other nuclear nations spent last year combined.
*  South African President Sirio Romposa has been re-elected for a second term after his
*  Congress managed to put together South Africa's first coalition government.
*  The coalition includes the Democratic Alliance, the ANC's longtime rival.
*  The ANC suffered a major defeat in the recent election when it lost its majority in parliament
*  for the first time since the end of apartheid 30 years ago.
*  Reuters has revealed the U.S. military ran a secret anti-vaccination campaign during
*  the pandemic in the Philippines and other nations in an effort to sow doubt about COVID
*  vaccines made by China.
*  The Pentagon campaign began in 2020 under Donald Trump and continued into mid-2021 after
*  Joe Biden took office.
*  The Pentagon set up numerous fake social media accounts on multiple platforms to target audiences
*  in the Philippines, Central Asia and the Middle East.
*  The campaign also aimed to discredit masks and test kits made in China.
*  One military officer involved in the campaign told Reuters, quote,
*  "'We weren't looking at this from a public health perspective.
*  We were looking at how we could drag China through the mud,' they said."
*  A judge in Missouri has overturned the conviction of a woman who spent 43 years in prison for
*  a murder she did not commit.
*  63-year-old Sandra Hamm is believed to have been jailed longer than any other woman who
*  was wrongfully convicted in the United States.
*  She was convicted of killing a librarian in 1980 solely based on self-incriminating statements
*  she made to police at a time when she was a patient at a psychiatric hospital where
*  she was being treated for auditory hallucinations and drug use.
*  Investigation has since emerged showing the actual murderer was a police officer who has
*  since died.
*  The governor of Maryland is planning today to pardon 175,000 marijuana convictions.
*  The sweeping move by Governor Wes Moore is expected to help about 100,000 people who
*  were arrested on low-level drug charges.
*  In an interview with The Washington Post, Governor Moore said, quote,
*  I'm ecstatic that we have a real opportunity with what I'm signing to right a lot of
*  historical wrongs, unquote.
*  Governor Moore said he'd time pardons for the week of Juneteenth, the federal holiday
*  on June 19th, to mark the end of slavery in the United States.
*  The U.S. Surgeon General is calling on Congress to require social media platforms to include
*  warnings stating that their apps can cause, quote, significant mental health harms for
*  adolescents, unquote.
*  In an op-ed for The New York Times, Dr. Vivek Murthy wrote, quote,
*  Evidence from tobacco studies show that warning labels can increase awareness and change behavior.
*  Climate activists in Europe are denouncing G7 leaders for not doing more to address the
*  climate emergency.
*  During the recent summit in Italy, G7 leaders committed to accelerating the transition away
*  from fossil fuels.
*  How much would the group Extinction Rebellion chain themselves together in Bari, Italy?
*  We call for this voice to be heard, that of the animals that are disappearing, of the
*  biodiversity that is dying, and also of the people who are living in the front line of
*  the eco-climate crisis, because international forums such as the G7 are not taking concrete
*  action.
*  Instead, they're going in the opposite direction.
*  Even though international institutes such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
*  Change or the International Energy Agency have repeatedly said that a transition is
*  possible, even while respecting the rights of people and workers, G7 countries continue
*  to invest in fossil gas, like Italy, in oil, like the U.S., in coal, like Japan or France
*  and Germany.
*  And the University of Minnesota has announced it will launch a new search for the new next
*  director of its Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, after rescinding its offer
*  to noted historian Professor Raz Siegel.
*  The center revoked its job offer to Siegel, who is an Israeli Jew, after two members of
*  its advisory board resigned to protest his hiring, who has called Israel's war on Gaza
*  a quote, a textbook case of genocide.
*  Hundreds of professors have signed a letter condemning the university's decision.
*  You can see our interview with Professor Siegel at democracynow.org.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
