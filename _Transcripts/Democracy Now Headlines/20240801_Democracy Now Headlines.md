# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” August 1, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF6KHIqxPbw)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel says it's confirmed Hamas's top military commander, Mohammed Deif, was killed
*  in an Israeli airstrike in southern Gaza on July 13th that killed some 100 people.
*  Hamas has not responded to the claim.
*  This comes amidst rapidly rising regional tensions following the killing of Hamas's
*  political chief, Ismael Khania, in a targeted Israeli strike in Tehran overnight Wednesday.
*  That strike took place just hours after Israel bombed a Beirut suburb, killing atop Hezbollah
*  leader.
*  Hezbollah confirmed on Wednesday Fouad Shukr had died in the attack.
*  Thousands gathered in Tehran today for Khania's funeral procession ahead of his upcoming burial
*  in Doha, Qatar.
*  Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who led today's funeral prayers, reportedly
*  issued an order on Wednesday for Iran to strike Israel directly in retaliation.
*  The U.N.'s warning a dangerous escalation following Israel's attacks that undermines
*  a possible ceasefire in Gaza.
*  In Gaza, displaced, war-plagued Palestinians responded to the assassination of Ismael Khania.
*  My personal opinion is that it is a bullet of mercy on the so-called negotiations.
*  The occupation, especially Netanyahu, were wasting time, and this bullet came to kill
*  these negotiations.
*  So we return to the truth that we are in a war, a genocide, and that the occupation does
*  not want negotiations nor deals, but rather the annihilation and to take over the Gaza
*  Strip.
*  Resistance is ready, God willing.
*  Ishmael Khania's blood is a fire that will be upon the occupation and its associates.
*  We'll have more on these latest developments after headlines.
*  Elsewhere in Gaza on Wednesday, Al Jazeera reporters Ismael Al Ghul and camera operator
*  Rami Al-Rifi were killed in a targeted Israeli airstrike as they were covering the death
*  of Ismael Khania in Gaza City's Shati camp, where Khania was born.
*  Al Jazeera's Khan Khudry broke down on air as she deplored her colleague's murder.
*  We do everything.
*  We wear our press jackets.
*  We wear our helmets.
*  We try to not go to anywhere where it's not safe.
*  We try to go to anywhere where to keep our security.
*  But we have been targeted in normal places where normal citizens are.
*  We are trying to do everything, but at the same time, we want to report.
*  We want to tell the world what's going on.
*  It's heartbreaking to report this today, and it's heartbreaking to report Sharia's
*  killing, Hamza's killing and Salmer's killing.
*  And this is not the first time we're doing this, but every time it feels as if it's
*  the first time.
*  It's a great loss for us here, journalists in Gaza, and especially Al Jazeera's team
*  losing such a colleague.
*  Al Jazeera pledged to pursue justice for its slain reporters and the more than 160 journalists
*  who've been killed while covering the war on Gaza.
*  Al Jazeera's managing editor, Mohammed Mouad, posted a message he'd recently received
*  from Ismail Al Ghul.
*  It read in part, quote,
*  "'Let me tell you, my friend, that I no longer know the taste of sleep.
*  The bodies of children and the screams of the injured and their blood-soaked images
*  never leave my sight.
*  The cries of mothers and the wailing of men who are missing their loved ones never fade
*  from my hearing.'"
*  Al Ghul added, quote,
*  "'I am tired, my friend.'"
*  Donald Trump took to the stage at the National Association of Black Journalists' annual
*  convention in Chicago Wednesday for what many described as an unhinged interview, in which
*  he openly attacked the panel of black women journalists who moderated the discussion.
*  He accused ABC News reporter Rachel Scott of being nasty as he delivered this stunning
*  response to a question about his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris.
*  I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black
*  and now she wants to be known as black.
*  So I don't know, is she Indian or is she black?
*  She is always identified as a black woman.
*  She went to a historically black college.
*  I respect either one, but she obviously doesn't.
*  Because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went,
*  she became a black person.
*  Just to be clear, sir, do you believe that she is a black person?
*  I think somebody should look into that too when you ask a continuant of very hostile,
*  nasty talent.
*  Separately, Trump claimed he was the best president for black people since Abraham Lincoln.
*  Kamala Harris responded to Trump's comments as she spoke Wednesday evening in an event
*  of the historically black sorority Sigma Gamma Rho in Houston, Texas.
*  The divisiveness and the disrespect.
*  And let me just say, the American people deserve better.
*  The American people deserve better.
*  We'll be playing excerpts of the Trump interview later in the broadcast.
*  In other election news, the powerful United Auto Workers Union has endorsed Kamala Harris
*  for president.
*  Harris will be in Detroit next week to rally with UAW members.
*  Harris also received the backing Wednesday of half a dozen climate groups who declined
*  to back Biden, including 350 Action, Center for Biological Diversity, Action Fund and
*  Food and Water Action.
*  In more election news, Trump loyalist Carrie Lake won Arizona's Republican primary for
*  U.S. Senate, where she will face Democratic Congressmember Ruben Gallego to replace conservative
*  Democrat-turned-independent Senator Kirsten Sinema.
*  Carrie Lake pushed election fraud conspiracies following Trump's 2020 loss to Biden and
*  her own loss to Democrat Katie Hobbs in Arizona's 2022 gubernatorial race.
*  The Sudanese military says its leader, General Abdel Fattah al-Baron, survived an attempted
*  assassination when a drone attack hit an army graduation ceremony killing five people.
*  The army accused the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces of being behind the attack, but the
*  RSF has denied responsibility.
*  The warring parties had just recently agreed to participate in U.S.-mediated talks in Geneva
*  this month to end the bloody civil war which has devastated Sudan since April of last year.
*  General Baran appeared to rebuff any possible peace deal as he spoke yesterday following
*  the attack.
*  We will not retreat.
*  We will not surrender.
*  And we will not negotiate with any party, no matter who it is.
*  There is nothing that scares us.
*  We do not fear drones or elves.
*  We will not die except in our day, and everyone's fate will come in its certain day.
*  That's why we will move with our heads high, and we'll fight with pride.
*  We will not surrender.
*  In Venezuela, President Nicolas Maduro says he could call for a new revolution if the
*  U.S. and others continue to challenge his win in Sunday's election.
*  Maduro spoke Wednesday from Caracas.
*  The United States, with its false diplomacy, moved around the world to set up this scenario
*  in Venezuela.
*  I have to say it all.
*  We negotiated with the United States in good faith, and they did not comply.
*  They are liars and phonies.
*  The U.S., Colombia, Brazil and other countries have called on Venezuela to release vote tallies.
*  Maduro's rivals have claimed they have proof that Edmundo Gonzalez received more votes,
*  but have not made this evidence public.
*  Human Rights Watch says it's verifying at least 20 credible death reports in post-election
*  protests.
*  The Pentagon announced Wednesday it's reached a plea deal with the accused 9-11 master Khalid
*  Sheikh Mohammed and two others involved in plotting the attack.
*  The three men, all detained at Guantanamo Prison, will reportedly plead guilty to conspiracy
*  and murder and receive life sentences, avoiding the death penalty.
*  The long-awaited news, the Center for Constitutional Rights said, quote,
*  "...these plea agreements are a substantial step toward ending military commissions and
*  the extra-legal nightmare of Guantanamo.
*  The military commissions at Guantanamo have never provided justice or accountability for
*  anyone.
*  Rather, for the last two decades, they've provided a veneer of legal process that serves
*  only to maintain the unacceptable status quo and cover up the torture and abuse of detainees."
*  unquote.
*  Center for Constitutional Rights has represented a number of Guantanamo prisoners.
*  And Russian authorities have reportedly released Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich
*  and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan as part of a prisoner swap with the U.S.
*  Few other details are known as of now.
*  This comes just weeks after a Russian court convicted Gershkovich of espionage, sentencing
*  him to 16 years in prison.
*  Paul Whelan was sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020 on spying charges.
*  Both men rejected the charges.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
