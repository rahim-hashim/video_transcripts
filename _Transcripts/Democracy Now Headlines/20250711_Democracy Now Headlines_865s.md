**Democracy Now Headlines:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=5.28s)]
*  In Gaza, the U.N. Human Rights Office said it's documented the killing of nearly 800 [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Palestinians seeking aid by Israeli forces. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Most of those have been at aid points run by the U.S. and Israeli-backed so-called Gaza [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=17.12s)]
*  Humanitarian Foundation, GHF. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=23.64s)]
*  The GHF announced it will now only operate one aid distribution site in Rafah, after [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=26.36s)]
*  shuttering hundreds of others across the Strip, many of them U.N. aid sites, forcing Palestinians [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=30.84s)]
*  in desperate need of aid to move south. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=36.92s)]
*  Aid groups say over 2 million Palestinians are now crammed into less than 15 percent [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=39.68s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip's total area. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=45.36s)]
*  On Thursday, an Israeli attack on Dara'a Balakh killed at least 16 Palestinians, including [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=48.6s)]
*  at least eight children, who gathered outside the Al-Tiyyatah clinic where they were waiting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=53.76s)]
*  to receive nutritional supplements. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=59.36s)]
*  The bodies of young children were seen lying on the street as medics scrambled to treat [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=61.68s)]
*  the wounded. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=66.44s)]
*  Children and women were thrown to the ground. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=70.36s)]
*  They were waiting for the place to open so they could receive nutritional supplements. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=72.72s)]
*  You know that the crossings are closed and there's no food or drink. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=77.08s)]
*  People are forced to wait here in order to get nutritional supplements for their children. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  This comes as the U.N. confirmed its first very limited fuel delivery into Gaza in at [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=86.08s)]
*  least 130 days. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=92.08s)]
*  The U.N. says the amount allowed in covered less than one day of Gaza's fuel needs. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=95.0s)]
*  Hospitals remain in critical condition. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=101.16s)]
*  This is pediatrician Ziad Al-Masri of Al-Halou Hospital. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=103.64s)]
*  There are three or four newborn babies in one incubator. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=110.8s)]
*  It is designed to accommodate one child, one premature baby. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=113.84s)]
*  Our situation is like a disaster. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=118.2s)]
*  The cramming of children leads to the spread of illness and inability to deal with them [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=120.24s)]
*  and therefore leads to a direct danger to them. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=125.2s)]
*  President Trump Thursday threatened to impose a 35 percent tariff on Canada starting August [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=129.96s)]
*  1st, as well as 15 percent and 20 percent tariffs on other nations. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=136.64s)]
*  As with other tariff threats he issued this week, Trump said the increased levy would [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=140.84s)]
*  be subject to negotiations. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  Trump accused Canada again of allowing fentanyl to cross the border into the U.S., a claim [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  which has been discredited. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=152.56s)]
*  Earlier this year, Trump imposed a 50 percent tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=154.76s)]
*  a 25 percent tariff on car parts. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  Separately, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva vowed Thursday to retaliate [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  in kind if President Trump goes ahead with a threatened 50 percent tariff on his country. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=167.8s)]
*  There's no doubt that first we'll try to negotiate, but if there's no negotiation, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=174.8s)]
*  the reciprocity law will put us into practice. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  If he charges us 50 percent, we'll charge him 50 percent. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  President Trump has threatened the 50 percent tariff on Brazil unless Brazil drops charges [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=186.84s)]
*  the former president and Trump ally, Bolsonaro. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=193.84s)]
*  In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked much of Trump's global tariffs agenda, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  ruling he exceeded his authority by invoking emergency powers. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  Trump is currently appealing that case. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=207.32s)]
*  Another federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's effort to terminate birthright [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  citizenship by approving a class action lawsuit. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=214.8s)]
*  The move allows plaintiffs to challenge Trump's executive order after the Supreme Court moved [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=218.16s)]
*  last month to restrict nationwide injunctions, a legal mechanism that's been used in previous [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=222.92s)]
*  efforts to block Trump's unconstitutional targeting of the longstanding immigration [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=228.84s)]
*  policy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=234.28s)]
*  Judge Joseph LaPlante, a George W. Bush appointee, said Trump's policy would lead to irreparable [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=235.84s)]
*  harm. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=243.04s)]
*  The class action lawsuit represents babies born in the U.S. to noncitizen parents on [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=244.44s)]
*  and after February 20th. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=248.88s)]
*  We'll have more on this and other immigration cases later on the broadcast with the ACLU's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=251.0s)]
*  League Alert. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=257.4s)]
*  In California, dozens of farm workers were detained as border agents teargashed and clashed [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=259.72s)]
*  with dozens of protesters who intervened during a raid Thursday in Camarillo. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=266.8s)]
*  This is a protester. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=271.88s)]
*  These guys showed up all tough, f—ing cowards, and they've already tried to push us out. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=275.84s)]
*  But there's more of us here now than there were before. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=279.72s)]
*  At the end of the day, they're the ones coming from over there. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=282.0s)]
*  They're not from here. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=284.20000000000005s)]
*  Farmers who work here take more of a beating than anyone else. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  They're not the ones who deserve this f—ing treatment. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=288.6s)]
*  The standoff lasted into the night, with federal agents blocking roads with military-style [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=292.0s)]
*  vehicles and lining up dozens of handcuffed people against a wall who'd been arrested [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  at agricultural fields. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  The agents said they were executing a warrant at a cannabis farm that also grows tomatoes [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=305.04s)]
*  and cucumbers. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=310.32s)]
*  The farm workers arrested were taken away on buses. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=311.8s)]
*  The Committee to Protect Journalists has called for the release of a prominent Spanish-language [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=315.84000000000003s)]

*  The Trump administration is ignoring a court ruling that ordered Guevara be released on [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=337.0s)]
*  bail. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=341.68s)]
*  He's lived in the United States for some 20 years and has built a large following for [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=342.68s)]
*  his reporting on anti-ICE protests. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=347.24s)]
*  This all comes as the Trump administration has banned undocumented children and low-income [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=350.94s)]
*  families from receiving federal assistance from the Head Start program that provides [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=356.44s)]
*  federally funded educational nutrition and health care services. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=361.84s)]
*  The National Head Start Association said in a statement, quote, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=365.88s)]
*  Head Start programs strive to make every child feel welcome, safe and supported and reject [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=369.2s)]
*  the characterization of any child as illegal. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=375.56s)]
*  The U.S. State Department announced plans to slash its domestic personnel by 15 percent [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=380.67999999999995s)]
*  after the Supreme Court gave Trump the green light last week to gut federal agencies and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=386.26s)]
*  carry out mass layoffs. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=391.02s)]
*  Hundreds of State Department bureaus will also be merged or eliminated in the so-called [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=393.38s)]

*  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is called again for the elimination of FEMA—that's [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=400.9s)]
*  the Federal Emergency Management Agency—accusing it of a slow response to the catastrophic [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=405.5s)]
*  floods in Texas. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=411.5s)]
*  But FEMA officials say the agency's response was a direct result of Noem's own policy, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=413.29999999999995s)]
*  which now requires that the Secretary of Homeland Security—that's Noem herself—sign off [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=420.5s)]
*  on any work costing more than $100,000 before deploying personnel, something which she apparently [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=426.78000000000003s)]
*  failed to do promptly. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=434.58000000000004s)]
*  Noem denied the claims. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=436.86s)]
*  This comes as the death toll has risen to at least 121. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=439.34000000000003s)]
*  One week after the historic flash floods devastated Texas, there are still over 100,000 people [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=444.34000000000003s)]
*  unaccounted for. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=451.14s)]

*  It's called empathy. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=470.94s)]
*  When you see that people are suffering and you can help them, you have to go do the work. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=472.42s)]
*  We're all the same people. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKluQ1f_OQ&t=476.82s)]
