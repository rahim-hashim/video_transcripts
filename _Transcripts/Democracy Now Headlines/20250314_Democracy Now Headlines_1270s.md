We speak with the acclaimed Russian American writer M. Gessen, who says Donald Trump has entered his second term prepared to enact his radical Project 2025 agenda, including a crackdown on LGBTQ rights and dissent. Gessen, who has spent decades writing about authoritarianism at home and abroad, argues that while he was something of an “accidental president” in his first term, “Trump has been transformed by power” and is now increasingly “imperialist” and “totalitarian.”

*  We last spoke to the Russian-American writer M. Gessen in December of 2023. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=26.68s)]
*  At the time, they were in Germany to receive the prestigious Hannah Arendt Prize, but the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=33.4s)]
*  initial ceremony was postponed after some of the award's sponsors withdrew support [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=38.84s)]

*  Gessen later won a George Polk Award for that article, in the shadow of the Holocaust, it [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  was called. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=55.4s)]
*  M. Gessen is the author of numerous books, including Surviving Autocracy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  They're also a columnist for The New York Times. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=62.32s)]
*  M., welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=65.28s)]
*  It's great to have you with us. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=67.68s)]
*  Thank you, Amy. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=69.68s)]
*  It's good to be here. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=71.68s)]
*  Back in November, you predicted Trump, quote, will likely begin by getting rid of experts, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=73.6s)]
*  and other civil servants he sees as superfluous, eliminating jobs that he thinks simply shouldn't [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=81.52s)]
*  exist. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=87.84s)]
*  You also write in that piece, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=88.84s)]
*  A major target outside of government will be universities. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=90.84s)]
*  Civil society groups, especially those that serve or advocate for immigrants, formerly [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=94.92s)]
*  incarcerated people, LGBTQ people, women and vulnerable groups, will be attacked. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=99.4s)]
*  Start off by talking about how you saw all this coming and then the response. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=107.92s)]
*  So a couple of things. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=117.36s)]
*  I listened to what Trump was saying, and it was very clear that, well, you know, he kept [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=119.88s)]
*  going on about trans people, about DI, and about universities. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=125.52s)]
*  And these were the novelties. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=131.8s)]
*  His attacks on government as it was constituted before his second term actually date back [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=135.0s)]
*  to his first term. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=141.28s)]
*  He made it very clear that he doesn't think that government should be constituted in the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=142.48s)]
*  way it has been. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=146.8s)]
*  He didn't have the number of people and the expertise and just sort of a sense of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=148.6s)]
*  how things worked sufficient in his first term to carry out his agenda, but it was made [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  very clear in Project 2025. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  And even if you didn't read Project 2025, in Trump's speeches, if you listened. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=162.76s)]
*  So that was one way to understand what was going to happen. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  Another way was I, sort of one of my great intellectual inspirations and sources is a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=170.76s)]
*  Hungarian political scientist, a sociologist named Balint Magyar, who has, over the last [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=176.88s)]
*  15 years, written a lot about ascending autocracies, about mafia states, about what happened in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=183.16s)]
*  Hungary and, more broadly, what has happened in Europe. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=190.6s)]
*  And he talked very convincingly to me for that article about getting rid of societies, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  institutions of deliberation, institutions where our obligations to one another are worked out. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=206.08s)]
*  And I think that that's a really interesting and illuminating prism to look at this through. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=213.52s)]
*  What, it's the way that Elon Musk summed it up in one of his tweets, that empathy is [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  the bane of Western civilization. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  And really, they do think that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=229.36s)]
*  And they see these expressions of empathy, expressions of mutual obligation and mutual [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=230.92s)]
*  interdependence in our institutions, and that's what they're going after. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=236.04s)]
*  So I think it's very important to understand that they're going after things like Medicaid [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  or Social Security. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=246.16s)]
*  It's not an externality. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=247.83999999999997s)]
*  It's not an unintended effect. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=248.83999999999997s)]
*  It's very much what they want to destroy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=250.88s)]
*  You also write about his second term being different from the first, saying, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  "'During his first term, you could really tell he felt like an accidental president. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=260.64s)]
*  This time, he seems to feel genuinely chosen. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=264.76s)]
*  There's a new messianic quality to his behavior. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=267.64s)]
*  He's not just making deals so he can accumulate wealth while he's president, as he did during [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=270.84s)]
*  his first term. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=275.52s)]
*  It seems to me he's now planning to rule for a long time, forever, in his imagination. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=276.52s)]
*  He wants to wield genuine power in the world, going to—I mean, just yesterday, meeting [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=282.44s)]
*  with the head of NATO in the Oval Office and talking about, once again, he's going to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=287.67999999999995s)]
*  take Greenland. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=292.35999999999996s)]
*  There's a bill in the Congress now, by the way, to rename it, Red, White and Blue Land. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=293.67999999999995s)]
*  And if people think that's just funny and ludicrous, think of AP being banned from the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=300.96s)]
*  press pool at the White House because they refuse to just say, "'Golf of America,' [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=305.88s)]
*  as he renamed the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  If you can talk about the significance of all of this—he says he's, yes, reaffirmed [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=315.36s)]
*  he's going to take Greenland, is now told the Pentagon to prepare to take Panama—and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=320.32s)]
*  talks about, once again, getting rid of the Palestinians in Gaza and rebuilding it for [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=325.52s)]
*  the world's people,' he said. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  And don't forget Canada, the 51st state, which really—you know, I was listening the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=337.04s)]
*  other day to a bunch of interviews from Canada that The Daily was broadcasting, and I was [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=345.68s)]
*  thinking this sounds so much like the way we used to talk about Russia and Ukraine, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  by we, I mean Russians and Ukrainians, before the invasion. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=358.8s)]
*  And, you know, there are all these tropes, like, we're so close, we're practically [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  one people. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  So many Canadians live, or so many Ukrainians lived in Russia, so many Canadians live in [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=369.76s)]
*  the United States. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  The border has been porous. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=375.02s)]
*  We couldn't possibly exist without each other. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=376.44s)]
*  And at the same time, you know, we're so close, you practically don't exist as a [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  country. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=383.96s)]
*  And it's at once unbelievable and completely real and extremely dangerous. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  We can't know whether he's going to go after Greenland or Gaza or Canada or Panama [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=395.2s)]
*  and Canal first, because he doesn't know what he's going to do first. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=400.88s)]
*  But I think that we have to believe that he's deadly serious. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=405.68s)]
*  He's deadly serious about this new imperialist identity for the United States. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=409.28s)]
*  I mean, not exactly new, but sort of rediscovered. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=414.8s)]
*  We haven't seen an explicitly expansionist political leader in generations in this country. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  But it's certainly a thing that exists, and it is particularly a thing that exists [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=426.24s)]
*  among leaders who want to be totalitarian leaders. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  Imperialism and totalitarianism really go hand in hand. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=432.8s)]
*  That's axiomatic. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=436.16s)]
*  And that, I think, is what we're watching. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=437.16s)]
*  And I think another thing that—you know, we often make this mistake both about political [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=440.4s)]
*  leaders and about ordinary people. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=444.48s)]
*  We don't notice how much they change. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=446.72s)]
*  And I think it is important to look at how Trump has been transformed by power, by winning [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=449.6s)]
*  two elections, by winning this last election quite convincingly. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=457.28s)]
*  Yes, he exaggerates how he won it, but I think that—the margin by which he won it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=461.76s)]
*  But I think that the sense that—and particularly surviving the assassination attempts, the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=469.4s)]
*  sense that he is chosen, that he has a mission, that this is something that makes him—sets [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=474.91999999999996s)]
*  him completely apart, not just from other people in the United States, but from any [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=480.76s)]
*  other president, any other political leader in the world. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=485.56s)]
*  These are really important things to look at and to understand that this is a very different [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=488.67999999999995s)]
*  phenomenon than we saw during his first term. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=493.91999999999996s)]
*  So, I want to ask you about the Democratic response, which you've also written about. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=497.04s)]
*  For example, right now, you have the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announcing he's [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=503.08s)]
*  voting for a Republican measure to keep the government funded, splitting from many Democratic [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=509.6s)]
*  senators and Congress members. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=515.32s)]
*  Now, you write, Trump understands politics as the interplay of power and ideology. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=517.52s)]
*  His opponents see politics as procedure. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=523.8s)]
*  The contrast has never been starker. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=526.68s)]
*  And you write, and never has the Democrats' technocratic, legalistic approach been more [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=530.92s)]
*  detrimental to the cause of democracy. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=536.64s)]
*  Talk about the span of response, everything from, you know, that golden escalator, which [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=540.64s)]
*  was repurposed yesterday as Jewish Voice for Peace. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=545.68s)]
*  A hundred people got arrested, and they went up and down the escalator, and they decried [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=549.72s)]
*  what's happening with Mahmoud Khalil, with immigrants, with trans people, etc. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=555.84s)]
*  To Schumer. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=560.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=562.84s)]
*  Well, so, I think that we're seeing a real failure on the part of organized politics, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=564.32s)]
*  on the part of the Democrats. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=572.08s)]
*  The response has really ranged from selective expressions of outrage, if you can call it [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=574.72s)]
*  that, like, certainly, Congressman Al Green shaking his cane during Trump's address [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=581.56s)]
*  to Congress. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=588.92s)]
*  But the rest of the Democrats were sitting there with paddles, with paddles, right, which [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=590.36s)]
*  is such—I think they were—they probably thought they were being incredibly principled [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  and sending a strong message. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=602.6s)]
*  But it looked like we're going to stay— [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=605.6s)]
*  And just to be clear, when you say paddles, you mean these little signs that said things [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=606.6s)]
*  like lies, and they would put them up and down? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=611.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=615.24s)]
*  Quietly, in an orderly fashion, without risking being removed from the chamber, without—you [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=616.96s)]
*  know, I mean, they could have just sat it out if they wanted to make a strong statement. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=623.0400000000001s)]
*  But this sort of raging takeover, raging nothing will be politics as usual on the right, and [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=630.76s)]
*  this kind of quiet, we're going to stay within the bounds of procedure, response on [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=640.6s)]
*  the left, or what we call the left within Congress, that contrast is so dispiriting [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=647.48s)]
*  to me. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=654.6s)]
*  You know, and within the Democratic Party, the response has really ranged from, we pick [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=655.6s)]
*  our battles, to James Carviles' article in The New York Times in which he argued for [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=660.16s)]
*  playing dead, literally for playing dead for a year, thinking that Republicans are just [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=666.32s)]
*  going to destroy themselves. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=672.12s)]
*  And that, I think, is such a huge mistake. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=674.52s)]
*  And it's probably a mistake that's systemic, that it's a heuristic that is really letting [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=677.2s)]
*  the Democratic Party down, and the heuristic is that they believe that there are going [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=685.32s)]
*  to be midterms. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=688.72s)]
*  They believe that there is going to be an election in four years, that they don't [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=689.7600000000001s)]
*  have to defend those basic assumptions, that these things are just going to happen. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=693.44s)]
*  But we can't take anything for granted anymore. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=698.5600000000001s)]
*  M. Gessen, I wanted to ask you about the House subcommittee hearing that abruptly ended Tuesday [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=701.12s)]
*  Texas Republican Representative Keith Self intentionally misgendered the new Democratic [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=708.74s)]
*  Representative Sarah McBride, the first transgender person to be elected to Congress, by introducing [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=716.22s)]
*  her as Mr. As Chairman McBride delivered remarks, the Democratic Congress member, Bill Keating, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=722.86s)]
*  interrupted demanding Self to reintroduce McBride. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=733.86s)]
*  This was the exchange. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=737.98s)]
*  I now recognize the representative from Delaware, Mr. McBride. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=738.98s)]
*  Thank you, Madam Chair. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=746.3000000000001s)]
*  Ranking member Keating also wonderfully— [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=747.94s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, could you repeat your introduction again, please? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=749.5s)]
*  Yes, it's a—we have set the standard on the floor of the House, and I'm simply— [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=753.5s)]
*  What is that standard, Mr. Chairman? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=760.86s)]
*  Would you repeat what you just said, when you introduced a duly elected representative [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=763.86s)]
*  from the United States of America, please? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=768.42s)]
*  I will. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=770.86s)]
*  The representative from Delaware, Mr. McBride. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=771.86s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, you are out of order. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=775.86s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, have you no decency? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=778.86s)]
*  As Congressman Keating, have you no decency? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=782.26s)]
*  It hasn't been commented on as much as after Mr. Self introduced McBride as Mr. McBride [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=786.66s)]
*  responded, thank you, Madam Chair. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=796.66s)]
*  But I'm guessing if you can respond to this overall attack on not just trans people, but [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=798.9s)]
*  the overall LGBTQ community, including the national federal website honoring Stonewall, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=804.74s)]
*  the T from LGBT, despite the fact that it was trans women who led the protests that [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=815.38s)]
*  really gave birth to the modern-day LGBTQ movement in this country. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=822.5s)]
*  Well, first of all, this isn't the first time that this has happened to Representative [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=828.5s)]
*  McBride. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=834.98s)]
*  She has been the target of systematic, explicit, humiliating, aggressive attacks since she [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=837.5s)]
*  began her term earlier this year. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=845.18s)]
*  And the fact that we just are watching this as a country and accepting it, not that the [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=848.2199999999999s)]
*  television or whatever watching public has much power to stop it, but just being subjected [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=857.3399999999999s)]
*  to this spectacle of public humiliation over and over again is something that is so destructive [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=864.4599999999999s)]
*  to, I think, everybody's psyche. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=871.9799999999999s)]
*  And I have a piece actually coming out in The Times this weekend talking about this [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=875.26s)]
*  attack on trans people, and it's not an attack on trans rights. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=880.26s)]
*  It's an attack on trans people, of whom I am one. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=884.02s)]
*  And I think it's most useful to think of it in the Arendtian framework of denationalization. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=889.26s)]
*  She argued that before people could be herded to concentration camps and death camps by [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=896.5s)]
*  Nazis, they had to be denationalized, pushed out of the national community, stripped of [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=903.14s)]
*  their, what she called, the right to have rights. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=909.3s)]
*  We think that we have these rights guaranteed to us because we're born. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=913.14s)]
*  But in fact, we have rights because we're part of a national community, because courts [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=916.94s)]
*  will enforce these rights, because communities will enforce these rights. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=921.3800000000001s)]
*  And when they're taken away, and they're taken away through a series of both legal [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=926.0600000000001s)]
*  and public rhetorical moves, what happens is the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=930.1400000000001s)]
*  has dropped cases of anti-trans discrimination, even though there is a Supreme Court decision [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=937.1800000000001s)]
*  from 2020 that makes it very clear that trans people are protected by discrimination because [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=944.52s)]
*  they're covered by the clause on the basis of sex. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=950.88s)]
*  And the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is basically refusing to enforce the law of [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=954.36s)]
*  the land because trans people have been placed outside the law. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=960.56s)]
*  Trans people have been receiving, whoever needs to renew their passport, have been receiving [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=964.48s)]
*  passports with the birth sex indicated on them instead of the gender that they've, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=969.58s)]
*  marker that they've been living with. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=976.3000000000001s)]
*  And I want to make very clear what that is. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=977.94s)]
*  It's not just an insult when you get this passport in the mail or pick it up from the [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=979.7s)]
*  passport agency. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=983.38s)]
*  It's a real obstacle to moving through the world, both on a daily basis, opening bank [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=985.14s)]
*  accounts, applying for loans, applying for financial aids. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=992.3000000000001s)]
*  If you have discordant documents, those are very hard things to do. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=995.76s)]
*  If you have documents that you're traveling with, whether inside the country, outside [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1001.72s)]
*  the country, that don't match your gender presentation. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1006.28s)]
*  You know, I was once detained in Russia by an officer who thought that I was a teenage [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1009.4399999999999s)]
*  boy—I mean, this was obviously years ago—a teenage boy who was using his mother's driver's [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1014.96s)]
*  license had a woman's name and the gender marker on it. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1021.2s)]
*  This takes away trans people's right to freedom of movement, one of the fundamental [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1027.64s)]
*  rights of humans, we think. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1033.3600000000001s)]
*  But they're very easy to take away. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1035.96s)]
*  So that's what we're watching. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1037.16s)]
*  We're watching the denationalization of a very small, very vulnerable minority group. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1038.16s)]
*  We've seen in this country already the denationalization of non-citizens. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1044.0s)]
*  Non-citizens are not members of the political community. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1048.96s)]
*  Non-citizens don't have the same civil and legal rights as citizens. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1052.28s)]
*  And now trans people are being put in the same category. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1056.92s)]
*  McBride, by the way, actually had a really interesting reply to her accession to the [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1059.4s)]
*  bathroom rule that the true act of civil disobedience was to occupy the congressional seat, not [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1066.72s)]
*  a toilet seat, and that she wouldn't take the bait, and that she seemed to be living [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1072.8s)]
*  rent-free in the minds of many Republicans. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1078.96s)]
*  I wanted to— [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1085.4s)]
*  She is brilliant and incredibly brave, yeah. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1086.4s)]
*  I wanted to switch gears for a moment. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1089.3600000000001s)]
*  You mentioned Russia, and you're growing up there, and I wanted you to quickly let [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1091.2800000000002s)]
*  people know why you left and what happened. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1095.72s)]
*  But I also wanted you to respond to Moscow saying, the latest news now, that Presidents [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1099.2s)]
*  Trump and Putin will discuss on the phone a possible 30-day ceasefire in Russia's [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1105.32s)]
*  war on Ukraine following Russian talks with the U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1109.6799999999998s)]
*  Putin signaled he's open to a truce proposal, but listed a series of conditions and concerns [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1115.84s)]
*  around ending the war. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1122.0s)]
*  Ukrainian President Zelensky accused Putin of manipulation, explaining Putin often does [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1125.56s)]
*  this. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1130.12s)]
*  He does not say no directly, but he does it in such a way that only delays and makes normal [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1131.12s)]
*  decisions impossible. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1134.34s)]
*  As we begin to wrap up, your response to what's happening right now around Ukraine? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1136.54s)]
*  Well, what's happening right now around Ukraine has been very painful to watch, because [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1142.74s)]
*  basically Putin has made his ambition very clear for many years. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1149.26s)]
*  His ambition is to restore a kind of Yalta world order, one in which the United States [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1154.26s)]
*  and Russia divide the world, carve it up. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1160.8200000000002s)]
*  They have spheres of influence, spheres of domination. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1163.78s)]
*  He doesn't necessarily want to restore Russian domination over Eastern Europe, but he wants [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1167.22s)]
*  to over the exact same part of Eastern and Central Europe as the Soviet Union dominated. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuM2xV6GQB4&t=1171.5800000000002s)]
