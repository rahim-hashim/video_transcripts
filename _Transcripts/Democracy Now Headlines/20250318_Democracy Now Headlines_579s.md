One of President Donald Trump’s most intense fixations since returning to the White House has been to take over and overhaul the Kennedy Center, the national arts and culture institution in Washington, D.C. Trump fired the president of the Kennedy Center, replaced the bipartisan board of trustees with loyalists and made himself chairman of the organization, vowing to shift programming away from “woke” art and toward more patriotic themes. On Monday, he visited the Kennedy Center to personally preside over a board meeting. Numerous artists have cut ties with the Kennedy Center since Trump’s takeover, but folk musicians Nora Brown and Stephanie Coleman performed a concert at the Kennedy Center last week and used the opportunity to protest Trump’s policies from the stage. “We were considering what the most effective method of protest was” and decided “our voices would be loudest on the stage,” says Brown. “The arts are a fundamental way for people to express ourselves and for us to recognize other people’s stories and experiences and struggles,” adds Coleman.

*  that's being imposed on the Kennedy Center.'" [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=94.30000000000001s)]
*  On Monday, Trump criticized Hamilton. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  I come here and see a show. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=98.78s)]
*  I was never a big fan of—I never liked Hamilton very much, and I never liked it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=101.78s)]
*  But we are going to have some really good shows. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=108.78s)]
*  I would say this. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=113.06s)]
*  Come here and watch it, and you'll see over a period of time it'll improve very greatly [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=114.06s)]
*  physically. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=118.64s)]
*  And we're going to get some very good shows. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=119.64s)]
*  The thing that does well are Broadway hits. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=120.64s)]
*  And we have some beauty. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=121.64s)]
*  I guess we have Les Mis coming, and we have some others. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=122.64s)]
*  But the Broadway hits have done very well. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=123.64s)]
*  So I'm going to spend some time. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=124.64s)]

*  Nora Brown and Stephanie Coleman unfurled banners during their concert that read, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=158.16s)]
*  Reinstate Queer Programming and Creativity at the Kennedy Center Must Not Be Suppressed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=163.16s)]
*  Nora also read this message from the stage. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=170.16s)]
*  We are outraged by the tyrannical change of leadership at the Kennedy Center. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=174.16s)]
*  By weaponizing the Kennedy Center's stages, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=181.16s)]
*  Trump has systematically sought to silence queer and BIPOC artists under the frenzied [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=184.16s)]
*  pretense of rooting out wokeness, a dog whistle for anything that dares challenge his hateful [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=189.16s)]
*  and dangerous administration. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=195.16s)]
*  Protest comes in many forms, and we want to honor the legacy of the Kennedy Center as [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=197.16s)]
*  a radical space. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=202.16s)]
*  Nora Brown and Stephanie Coleman join us in our studio here in New York. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=204.16s)]
*  We welcome you both to Democracy Now! [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=208.16s)]
*  It was Thursday night when Vance was booed that you were there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=210.16s)]
*  Nora, start off by talking about the banners you unfurled and your message, why you decided [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=214.16s)]
*  to perform but also share this message of protest. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=221.16s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Amy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=225.16s)]
*  I guess, well, there was a lot of lead-up to this decision, you know. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=228.16s)]
*  There were many people canceling, as you mentioned before, and we're really considering what [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=232.16s)]
*  the most effective means of protest would be for us as smaller artists who have access [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=237.16s)]
*  to the stage, and we ended up deciding that our voices would be loudest on the stage, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=242.16s)]
*  and that that was the place for us to kind of raise some awareness of the situation, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=249.16s)]
*  but also like create a space for collective singing and, you know, use folk music, which [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  is what we do best to kind of allow for that resistance to exist in the music itself. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=262.16s)]
*  Stephanie, what's at stake in your viewpoint for the arts and creative freedom under this [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=272.16s)]
*  Trump administration? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=280.16s)]
*  Oh, man, what's at stake for the arts under this Trump administration? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=282.16s)]
*  I mean, this is, the arts are a fundamental way for people to express ourselves and for [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=286.16s)]
*  us to recognize other people's stories and experiences and struggles, and for the arts [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=294.16s)]
*  to come under attack by the Trump administration is, just seems like such a blatant and disgusting [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=301.16s)]
*  way of trying to divide people, and, you know, as musicians, this is our way of connecting [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=307.16s)]
*  with others, and it just feels like that's just such a clear, like, step in the authoritarian [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=312.16s)]
*  playbook. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=319.16s)]
*  Yeah, and I feel like art is a unique medium of resistance because it's all about self-expression, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=321.16s)]
*  and self-expression invites critical thinking, and that's what really is what Trump is afraid [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=327.16s)]
*  of, and we see that in how he's, you know, defunding higher education, that he doesn't [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=332.16s)]
*  want people to question his administration, he doesn't want people to be exposed to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=337.16s)]
*  other ways of thinking, that, you know, that's really what he's afraid of. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=342.16s)]
*  One of the things he did yesterday, there aren't other presidential portraits but [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=346.16s)]
*  John F. Kennedy, it's the John F. Kennedy Performing Arts Center, but he unveiled portraits [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=350.16s)]
*  of himself, of Melania, of JD Vance and of his wife Usha. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=355.16s)]
*  You chose one of your songs that you performed was The Unicorn. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=362.16s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=367.16s)]
*  Well, I learned this song recently. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=368.16s)]
*  It's by a guy named Peter Grudzian, who is what maybe would fall into the outsider artist [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=371.16s)]
*  category, kind of an anti-folk thing that was happening in maybe the early 70s, and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=378.16s)]
*  he was from Astoria, and he's been dubbed kind of the first gay male country musician, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=384.16s)]
*  and so it kind of seemed to fit with the program that we were working on, you know, but yeah, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=392.16s)]
*  it's a beautiful song, and he's really such an incredible and unique songwriter, and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=399.16s)]
*  we were excited to share that with people. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=403.16s)]
*  You express yourselves through your music, and you've brought your fiddle, you've brought [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=407.16s)]
*  your guitar. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=412.16s)]
*  What do you want to share with us? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=413.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, we'd love to play a piece of The Unicorn. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=414.16s)]
*  It's the song we love so much, and so we'd love to play it for you now. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=419.16s)]
*  Right ahead. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=423.16s)]
*  Welcome, Nora Brown and Stephanie Coleman. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=425.16s)]
*  On the stage here at Democracy Now. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=429.16s)]
*  One, two, three, one. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=433.16s)]
*  One, two, three, one. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=437.16s)]
*  Well, spring's in the streets again, till now the season's gone by. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=441.16s)]
*  We move to cruise and stare at our stars, hoping to find someone half blind, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=465.16s)]
*  somebody who will make us near to hold in the night and guard us from the fire. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=479.16s)]
*  We'll change all that's gone for the next while in our very city there was a real life unicorn. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=492.16s)]
*  That queen of my bones, the unicorn, will be reborn. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=514.16s)]
*  The folk musicians Nora Brown and Stephanie Coleman, they performed on Thursday. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=524.16s)]
*  That was the day the Vances were booed as they came into the Kennedy Center. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=551.16s)]
*  Nora and Stephanie performed The Unicorn and much more. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=556.16s)]
*  They also unfurled banners at their concert, reading, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=560.16s)]
*  reinstating queer programming and creativity at the Kennedy Center must not be suppressed. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macmqxEtePY&t=564.16s)]
