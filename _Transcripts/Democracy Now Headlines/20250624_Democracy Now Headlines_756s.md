“You can't, as the president, engage in strikes on a foreign country when there's no imminent threat, without coming to Congress for authorization,” says Ro Khanna, Democratic congressmember and member of the House Armed Services Committee, criticizing President Trump’s decision to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites as “blatantly unconstitutional” and a clear instance of executive overreach. Khanna and Republican congressmember Thomas Massie recently introduced a bipartisan Iran War Powers resolution in a bid to prevent further U.S. involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict. Khanna shares how anti-war voices in U.S. politics are too often silenced by powerful and wealthy interest groups and urges the Democratic Party to harness widespread anti-war sentiment in opposition to Trump’s increasingly authoritarian foreign policy.

# "Blatantly Unconstitutional": Rep. Ro Khanna Decries U.S. Strikes on Iran Without Congressional OK
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Juan González. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=4.4s)]
*  Just hours after a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran begins, President Trump criticized [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=7.4s)]
*  both countries this morning, explicitly saying he's not happy with Israel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=14.56s)]
*  This all comes two days after Trump ordered U.S. attacks on three Iranian nuclear sites [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  without seeking congressional approval. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=25.84s)]
*  We turn now to look at the role Congress plays in starting wars. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=29.56s)]
*  For more on this question, we're joined by Democratic Congressmember Ro Khanna, member [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=33.68s)]
*  of the House Armed Services Committee. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=37.56s)]
*  Last week, he introduced a bipartisan Iran War Powers Resolution with Republican Congressmember [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  Thomas Massie in a bid to prevent U.S. involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict and reassert that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=45.58s)]
*  any U.S. military action against Iran must be authorized by Congress. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=52.58s)]
*  We want to start by asking Congressmember Khanna to respond to Defense Secretary Pete [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=58.92s)]
*  Hegseth in a press conference talking about the Trump administration fulfilling the notification [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=64.84s)]
*  requirements of the War Powers Act by notifying Congress immediately after. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=71.56s)]
*  They were notified after the planes were safely out, when we complied with the notification [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=77.48s)]
*  requirements of the War Powers Act. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=83.12s)]
*  After the attacks, they were notified. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=84.4s)]
*  They were immediately thereafter. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=86.04s)]
*  Well, for more, Congressmember Ro Khanna joins us from the Cannon Rotunda in D.C., deputy [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=87.92s)]
*  whip of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, member of the House Armed Services Committee. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=93.88s)]
*  Last night, I watched an hour-and-a-half Q&A. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  That was a move on .org event titled Fund Healthcare, Not Warfare. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=102.68s)]
*  Ro Khanna was the main guest. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=108.16s)]
*  Congressmember Khanna, respond to what Hegseth is saying and what you are demanding. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=111.76s)]
*  Well, he's just violating the Constitution. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  You can't, as the president, engage in strikes on a foreign country when there's no imminent [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=123.12s)]
*  threat without coming to Congress for authorization. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=129.0s)]
*  In this case, the missile strikes were characterized as a war on Iran. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=132.78s)]
*  That was how it was characterized in papers across our country. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=137.12s)]
*  That's how the Iranian people felt it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=140.16s)]
*  And that's why Representative Massey and I introduced the bipartisan War Powers Resolution. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  Now, the good thing is, I think, actually, President Trump paid attention. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=148.52s)]
*  He saw that there was a lot of revolt within his own MAGA base, people like Marjorie Taylor [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=152.72s)]
*  Greene, Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson speaking out. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=157.96s)]
*  And he has gotten a ceasefire. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=161.84s)]
*  Now the key is, is he going to make sure that the ceasefire holds? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=164.32s)]
*  And is he actually going to engage in the kind of negotiation that President Obama engaged [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=168.12s)]
*  in to make sure that Iran doesn't develop a nuclear weapon? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=173.04s)]
*  The danger is Iran is just going to learn the lesson of Pakistan and North Korea and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=177.12s)]
*  take their nuclear program in a covert direction. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=182.04s)]
*  And Congressman, how do you react to some of your colleagues, your Republican colleagues, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  who say the Democrats are crying now, but when Democrats engaged in bombings without [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  seeking congressional approval, they were silent, specifically for some of the bombings [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=196.72s)]
*  that President Obama did in Yemen, the attacks on Libya and other countries? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=203.08s)]
*  Well, frankly, they're right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=209.68s)]
*  I mean, the Libya attacks were blatantly unconstitutional. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=211.16s)]
*  Those strikes were also counterproductive. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=214.88s)]
*  They incentivized countries to say, if you voluntarily agree to give up your nuclear [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=218.28s)]
*  program, the United States may still attack you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  And the attacks on Yemen were unconstitutional. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=225.6s)]
*  Bernie Sanders and I passed the first War Powers Resolution to stop the refueling of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=228.88s)]
*  Saudi planes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  So I have been consistent, as have a few of us, speaking out against unconstitutional [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  strikes, whether they're Democratic or Republican presidents. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  The question for the Democratic Party is, are we going to take the mantle of being the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=244.4s)]
*  anti-war party? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=249.28s)]
*  That's not pacifism. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  That means against these wars of choice. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=252.2s)]
*  The American people are desperate for that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=254.8s)]
*  The anti-war candidate has usually won. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=257.36s)]
*  And Trump outflanked us in 2016 and 2024 on an anti-war platform. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=260.64s)]
*  I am pushing my party to be very clear that we will stand against these overseas wars [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=266.48s)]
*  of choice. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=273.2s)]
*  And could you explain what the 1973 War Powers Resolution calls for? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=275.72s)]
*  Well, there are two different issues. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=280.8s)]
*  One is the Constitution itself. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=284.04s)]
*  And the Constitution says that before you strike another country and declare war, you [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=285.64000000000004s)]
*  need to come to Congress. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=291.0s)]
*  The War Powers Resolution says that if there is hostility that the president has initiated, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=292.48s)]
*  he needs to notify Congress, and then Congress can vote to stop that hostility. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  So it is a check that Congress has when the president acts in a way that defies congressional [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  authorization. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  But what we should have in this country is not the need to use a War Powers Resolution. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  What we should have in this country is the president coming to Congress before they want [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=316.68s)]
*  to strike another country. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  And in many cases, they may actually get the authorization. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=322.44s)]
*  Here Donald Trump didn't want to come to Congress because he knew at least one-third [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=325.92s)]
*  of his own MAGA base was opposed to the strikes and would have debated and argued against [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=329.76s)]
*  it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  So, you are cosponsoring this resolution with the Republican congressmember, Massey. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=337.32s)]
*  Trump, Trump aides have launched a new super PAC devoted to defeating Massey in his 2026 [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=343.32s)]
*  election. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=351.76s)]
*  The new PAC, called Kentucky MAGA, will be run by two of Trump's top political lieutenants, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=353.52s)]
*  his former co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita and longtime pollster Tony Fabrizio. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  Can you respond and also take this larger to the issue of super PACs that you have long [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=366.48s)]
*  taken on, rejecting super PAC money in your own campaign? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=373.16s)]
*  And do you think the weapons industry are long profiting from these super PACs? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=378.20000000000005s)]
*  The biggest problem in American democracy is the role of big money. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=385.76s)]
*  It has skewed our foreign policy into bloated defense budgets. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=390.12s)]
*  It has skewed our foreign policy in the Middle East. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  It has prevented us from getting Medicare for all. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  It has prevented us from taking on a big pharma and lowering prescription drug prices. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=399.52s)]
*  It has prevented us from getting rid of fossil fuel subsidies. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=404.52s)]
*  It is why I don't take any PAC money. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=407.56s)]
*  It's why Summer Lee and I have a bill to outlaw super PACs that still would be constitutional [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=410.2s)]
*  under Citizens United. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=415.44s)]
*  If you can regulate the amount of money someone can give to a candidate, why can't you regulate [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=416.97999999999996s)]
*  the amount of money someone can give to a super PAC? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=421.92s)]
*  And what Donald Trump is doing to Thomas Massey is unconscionable. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=424.8s)]
*  Thomas Massey is actually a profile in courage. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=429.92s)]
*  I believe him speaking up in our War Powers Resolution helped put pressure on Donald Trump [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=432.32s)]
*  to not escalate this war further and to get a ceasefire. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=437.8s)]
*  And the reason that Donald Trump is targeting Thomas Massey is not just vindictiveness. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  When he's vindictive, he'll tweet out. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  He may encourage a primary challenge. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=449.24s)]
*  Here he's putting his entire apparatus, his top political operatives and a super PAC against [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=451.56s)]
*  Massey because he knew that other Republicans were thinking of joining that War Powers Resolution. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=456.96s)]
*  He knew that he was bleeding his base and he wanted to send a clear message, a chilling [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=463.12s)]
*  effect to the Congress not to do what Massey did. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=468.0s)]
*  Massey got under his skin and I'm glad that some of the Republicans spoke out so we're [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=471.76s)]
*  not escalating the war. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=475.78s)]
*  But it is just a perversion of democracy to see these super PACs. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=477.74s)]
*  They took out my friend Jamal Bowman and they threatened members of Congress in undemocratic ways. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=480.96s)]
*  And Congressman, I wanted to ask you, all of this expanding hostilities in the Middle [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=487.23999999999995s)]
*  East come in the midst of Congress grappling with what to do about the so-called one big [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=493.68s)]
*  beautiful bill, the budget bill of the signature budget bill of the Trump administration. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  What's your sense of the impact of this continuing problems internationally on where this bill [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=506.24s)]
*  is going? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=512.04s)]
*  The bill is a betrayal of Trump to his base. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=514.14s)]
*  I mean, Trump promised no more money on wars overseas and I'm going to help support and [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=517.28s)]
*  fund the working and middle class. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=524.2s)]
*  Instead, what is he doing? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=526.4s)]
*  He's increasing the defense budget by $150 billion. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=527.84s)]
*  He's spending billions of dollars on this war in Iran and he's literally ripping health [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=531.52s)]
*  care, Medicaid, food assistance away from the working and middle class, many of them [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIv-5Ir4xc&t=538.36s)]
