*  I'm Amy Goodman with Juan González. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=11.56s)]
*  We turn now to a new report that reveals how Israel is trying to make Gaza unlivable. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=13.92s)]
*  It's been well documented that Israeli airstrikes account for mass casualties. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=19.44s)]
*  Now the independent news outlet, 972 Magazine, has spoken to Israeli soldiers who reveal [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=26.64s)]
*  new details about how they've been systematically using bulldozers and explosives to flatten [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=32.8s)]
*  Gaza from the ground. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=40.6s)]
*  For example, Gaza's government media office says the Israeli army has destroyed at least [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  90 percent of residential neighborhoods in the southern city of Raqqa. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=47.64s)]
*  The 972 Report features videos. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=51.84s)]
*  Israeli soldiers shared online, like this one by Avraham Zarviev, who operates a D-9 [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  armored bulldozer. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=62.16s)]
*  His nickname is Flattener of Jabalia, the northern town of Jabalia in Gaza. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  In this video, he uses his camera to show a flattened landscape in Rafah. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=70.22s)]
*  Very good. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=75.88s)]
*  Gavati Brigade, very good. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=78.11999999999999s)]
*  Yes, Rafah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=80.11999999999999s)]
*  Rafah Ed, as they say. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=81.11999999999999s)]
*  There will be no more battle in Rafah, because there will be no more Rafah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=89.6s)]
*  The nation of Israel lives. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=93.63999999999999s)]
*  For more, we're joined in Tel Aviv by Mehron Rapaport, editor and writer at the independent [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=96.63999999999999s)]
*  Israeli news site Local Call and a columnist at 972 Magazine, where his new piece with [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=102.0s)]
*  Auron Ziv is headlined, Render It Unusable, Israel's Mission of Total Urban Destruction. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=108.08s)]
*  Mehron, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=114.4s)]
*  Why don't you lay out what you found and these—the access you had, well, because [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=117.08s)]
*  they post them online publicly, to these Israeli soldiers' actual video accounts themselves [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=123.2s)]
*  of what they're doing in Gaza? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=130.96s)]
*  I think that Gaza is being destroyed and is already destroyed. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=137.12s)]
*  This is not really new. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=142.9s)]
*  We know that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  We know that there are very few buildings standing in Rafah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=146.32s)]
*  in this investigation, Auron Ziv and I, is that this is a premeditated—most of it is [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=154.64s)]
*  premeditated that this is the routine work of soldiers today or in the last year or maybe [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=165.92s)]
*  more than a year, since the beginning of 2024. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=174.72s)]
*  The routine work is to destroy, that this is what they are doing as a routine army service. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=179.48s)]
*  They go out in the morning, they either accompany bulldozers or a unit that is responsible for [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=187.72s)]
*  explosives. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=197.2s)]
*  They go, choose buildings and flatten them in a systematic way, and that the aim is quite—it [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=198.2s)]
*  is being said to them. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=208.8s)]
*  Of course, this is not official orders coming from the general headquarters of the Israeli [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=210.56s)]
*  army, but this is very bluntly told, they're being told, and they are themselves very proud [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=218.24s)]
*  of it, that the real aim is to make it impossible for the Palestinians to return to these areas. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=225.64s)]
*  We have seen that now. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=233.96s)]
*  In these days, in Rafah, we are telling that 4 percent of the buildings in Rafah are unhurt, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=235.44s)]
*  undamaged. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=247.72s)]
*  Only 4 percent, a city of 200,000 people before the war. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=248.72s)]
*  So it is a systematic thing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=256.64s)]
*  It's not done by—it's not during battle. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=258.84s)]
*  It's not even a result of airstrike, although of course airstrike are responsible for some [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=262.64s)]
*  of the damage. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=268.28s)]
*  It is a planned thing, and in this, I think it is unprecedented. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=269.44s)]
*  And, Marin, you open your piece quoting a soldier you identify only as Y, and he describes [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=273.4s)]
*  the demolition methods, and I'm quoting you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=284.2s)]
*  You write, quote, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  I secured four or five bulldozers from another unit. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=287.79999999999995s)]
*  They demolished 60 houses per day. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=291.64s)]
*  Six—oh, a one- or two-story house they take down within an hour, a three- or four-story [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=294.56s)]
*  house takes a bit longer. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=300.2s)]
*  The official mission was to open a logistical route for maneuvering, but in practice the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=302.28s)]
*  bulldozers were simply destroying homes. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=307.29999999999995s)]
*  So, this is—to reiterate what you said, this is not in the process of a battle. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=312.36s)]
*  This is supposedly after, let's say, there's been a battle or conflict, what they—what [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=317.32s)]
*  the Israeli soldiers are doing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=323.48s)]
*  So this is total ethnic cleansing of an entire territory. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=325.88s)]
*  It's effectively what they're doing, isn't it? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=330.96s)]
*  Effectively, yes. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=335.8s)]
*  Of course, this goes into some gray zone in the international law, what is called domicide, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=337.68s)]
*  destruction of whole urban areas. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=347.16s)]
*  It is not officially a crime against humanity. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=352.0s)]
*  It is certainly against the laws of war to destroy buildings that have nothing to do [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=356.96s)]
*  with military action. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  But yes, I think this—there is no doubt that the intention here is ethnic cleansing. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=366.04s)]
*  The intention here is to make these cities, Rafah, Gebalia, the Netsarim Corridor, for [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=373.24s)]
*  the moment, maybe we are seeing something new in the next days, but to make these areas [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=381.6s)]
*  impossible, it will be completely impossible for the population to come back because there [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=389.56s)]
*  is nothing left. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=394.56s)]
*  And it is being said quite openly by the soldiers, by the videos that they air themselves, by [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=396.04s)]
*  soldiers who spoke to us. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=403.96000000000004s)]
*  It is quite clear that this is the intention. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=407.90000000000003s)]
*  Now, the IDF, in its official response to us, said that, no, this is part of operational—there [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=411.68s)]
*  is operational needs that require these demolitions of houses, and this has to do only with operational [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=420.92s)]
*  needs, houses or buildings where they were—they shoot at Israeli soldiers or there were explosives, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=429.4s)]
*  Hamas planted explosives in these houses. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=440.0s)]
*  But what we are seeing is so clear. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=442.88s)]
*  And again, Netanyahu, Prime Minister Netanyahu himself said that we are destroying house [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=445.32s)]
*  by house so they will have nowhere to come back to. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  Betar Lismotrich, the finance minister, said just yesterday that we are not leaving even [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=457.52000000000004s)]
*  one stone standing. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=465.20000000000005s)]
*  So it's very clear that the IDF reaction is not based on reality. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=467.04s)]
*  And did you discover any moral qualms among some of the Israeli soldiers that you interviewed [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=474.16s)]
*  about this practice? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=482.72s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=485.16s)]
*  The soldiers that talked with us didn't feel good or felt very bad with what they [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=488.8s)]
*  were doing, and this is the reason they talked to us. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=498.64s)]
*  We talked with about 10 soldiers. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=501.76s)]
*  But they also said that this is such a routine now for Israeli soldiers that they don't [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  that most of the soldiers do not pay much attention, because this is the routine. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=513.2s)]
*  This is what they do. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=520.4s)]
*  There's very little real fighting. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  One soldier who spent three months in the Nasserim corridor said that he had very, very [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=527.8s)]
*  little real fighting in all these three months. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=533.96s)]
*  And the routine work was to, if there were enough explosives, because sometimes there [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=537.6s)]
*  were not enough explosives, but if there were enough explosives, they would go in the morning, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=543.16s)]
*  choose between five, ten houses to demolish. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=549.28s)]
*  And this is the routine work. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=554.0400000000001s)]
*  So the soldiers really were very used to it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=555.96s)]
*  And of course, there were these soldiers that were politically motivated, right-wing soldiers, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=559.88s)]
*  that really rejoiced in the fact that these Palestinians will have nowhere to return [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=566.56s)]
*  to. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=572.96s)]
*  But this is not the main, I would say, atmosphere. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=573.96s)]
*  The atmosphere is, this is the work we are doing, and we just do it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=577.24s)]
*  That's what we are sent for. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  And, Mehran Rappaport, I wanted to ask you about Microsoft's support for Israel. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=584.92s)]
*  The Associated Press reports that Microsoft has now acknowledged it sold advanced artificial [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=591.52s)]
*  intelligence and cloud computing services to the Israeli military during the war in [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  Gaza and aided in efforts to locate and rescue Israeli hostages, unquote. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=603.56s)]
*  Microsoft confirmed this in an unsigned blog post. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=610.88s)]
*  On Monday, a Microsoft worker who's a member of the NoAzure4 partake disrupted Microsoft [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=614.72s)]
*  CEO Satya Nadella's keynote address at the company's flagship build event in Seattle, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=622.0s)]
*  Washington. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=629.04s)]
*  Satya, how about you show them how Microsoft is killing Palestinians? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=630.04s)]
*  How about you show them how Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=635.52s)]
*  Because of Microsoft's worker, I refuse to be complicit in this genocide. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=641.28s)]
*  I wanted, Mehran, to get your response to these developments and what we know about [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=646.68s)]
*  Microsoft's role. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=652.04s)]
*  As you've edited reports by 972 on Microsoft, including one in January, headlined, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=653.48s)]
*  leaked documents expose deep ties between Israeli army and Microsoft in a piece that [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=660.72s)]
*  was written by Yuval Abraham, who won the Oscar for being a co-director of the film [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=670.28s)]
*  No Other Land. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=675.16s)]
*  Mehran? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=676.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=680.32s)]
*  It seems that this is—of course, there was this report by Yuval, and then there was a [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=681.32s)]
*  previous report quoting mainly Israeli sources, open sources, the head of a unit that is responsible [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=687.88s)]
*  for computing in the Israeli army, that she said that they received essential help to [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=701.92s)]
*  the Israeli war machine from these big three cloud companies, Azure and—so this is—and [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=710.28s)]
*  we had these documents that we revealed, that Yuval revealed later on. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=726.4399999999999s)]
*  So the relationship is certainly very close, and it does seem that this creates problems [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=732.64s)]
*  for Microsoft internally and maybe externally and internally. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=741.1999999999999s)]
*  We have to see. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=747.48s)]
*  We have maybe other reports coming. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=748.76s)]
*  I think this story is not over. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=753.08s)]
*  And Mehran Rappaport, you have—the United Nations reported in March—that from March [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=758.0s)]
*  2025, since the beginning of 2024, Israel has demolished 463 buildings in the West Bank [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=763.6s)]
*  as part of a military activity, and it's displaced nearly 40,000 Palestinians from several cities [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=771.32s)]
*  in the West Bank. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=780.84s)]
*  Could you talk about that? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=781.84s)]
*  And also, you've reported that in Lebanon, Israel used similar demolition operations? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=783.36s)]
*  It does seem that this has become really part of the Israeli war—the way the modus operandi [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=790.48s)]
*  of Israeli army, destruction per se, not during fighting. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=805.6s)]
*  We have seen that in Lebanon. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=811.48s)]
*  We had reports in our investigation in which a soldier was told in advance that what he [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=813.76s)]
*  is going to do is to destroy the Shiite villages in Lebanon, even before he came in. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=821.4399999999999s)]
*  So it didn't have anything—it didn't have direct relation to the fighting. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=828.7199999999999s)]
*  And it seems that this— [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=836.4399999999999s)]
*  Mehran, we have 30 seconds. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=837.4399999999999s)]
*  This is a way of action. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=838.72s)]
*  It seems that this is way of action is being copied and employed in the West Bank as well. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=841.32s)]
*  I want to thank you so much for being with us, Mehran Rappaport, editor and writer at [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=850.72s)]
*  the independent Israeli news site Local Call and a columnist at Plus972 Magazine. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=855.5600000000001s)]
*  We'll link to your new article, Render It Unusable, Israel's Mission of Total Urban [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=861.5200000000001s)]
*  Destruction. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=867.2s)]
*  Mehran was speaking to us from Tel Aviv. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkpzaTtPZA&t=868.2s)]
