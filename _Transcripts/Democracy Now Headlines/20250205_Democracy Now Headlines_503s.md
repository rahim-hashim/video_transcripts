We speak with Karla Gilbride, the former general counsel of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, who was fired by President Trump in late January along with two commissioners at the federal agency that enforces civil rights law in the workplace. The EEOC was created as part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and is tasked with investigating discrimination based on race, ethnicity, sex and other characteristics, but the Trump administration is gutting the agency as part of its larger assault on DEI, or diversity, equity and inclusion. The EEOC says it will no longer focus on anti-trans discrimination and vows to uphold a binary view of sex and gender.

*  Senator Xi and two EEOC commissioners were fired last week in the late-night purge. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=52.66s)]
*  In 2022, Gilbride became the first blind lawyer to argue before the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=59.54s)]
*  She's now the new deputy director of Public Citizen Litigation Group. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=66.7s)]
*  Welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=70.46s)]
*  Why were you fired? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=72.42s)]
*  Talk about you and the commissioners. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=74.1s)]
*  Is this even legal? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=76.22s)]
*  Hi, Amy. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=77.22s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=78.22s)]
*  So, I was fired last week as general counsel of the EEOC. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  That's the position that heads the litigation program. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=86.7s)]
*  As you mentioned, two of the four commissioners, two who were appointed by President Biden, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=89.38s)]
*  were also fired, and that is unprecedented. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=98.02000000000001s)]
*  There have never been commissioners fired before the end of their term, and this is [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=102.06s)]
*  not the only agency where Trump has done this in recent weeks. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=105.86s)]
*  And the EEOC was established as part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to ensure equal opportunity [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=112.1s)]
*  in the workplace based on make sure people are not discriminated on, based on race, based [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=121.5s)]
*  on sex, based on disability, age, national origin or religion. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=127.22s)]
*  And I am concerned that President Trump removing commissioners will imperil that mission. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=133.22s)]
*  I'm also concerned, based on the press release that you just read, that, you know, one of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=141.1s)]
*  the parts of the EEOC's mission and the litigation program that I worked on as general counsel [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=147.82s)]
*  involved enforcing the 2020 Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=154.86s)]
*  recognized discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity as forms [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=162.8s)]
*  of sex discrimination. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=168.08s)]
*  And the binary of sex that doesn't recognize, you know, that people, the reality, the lived [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=170.4s)]
*  reality and the medical reality, that people have gender identities that do not match their [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=180.28s)]
*  sex assigned at birth, and that if someone is discriminated against because they're [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=186.72000000000003s)]
*  gender, because they're non-binary or certainly because of their sexual orientation, which [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=191.12s)]
*  is not mentioned in that press release, those are protected traits under Supreme Court precedent [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=196.88s)]
*  and under Title VII. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=205.08s)]
*  And the EEOC needs to be able to vigorously enforce that law as passed by Congress and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=206.36s)]
*  as enforced by the Supreme Court. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=212.56s)]
*  Carlo Cubine, I'm wondering, you mentioned that this kind of sledgehammer approach is [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  not just at the EEOC, but throughout the federal government in the last few weeks. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=222.92s)]
*  It reminds me that Mussolini, the founder of modern fascism, declared that fascism was [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=230.0s)]
*  in essence, he called it corporatism, a merger of state and corporate power. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  And we're seeing this merger occurring right here now as more and more billionaires and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=242.98s)]
*  business people are taking over the functions of government. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=248.34s)]
*  I'm wondering your sense of what this means to the view of the state as sort of a mediator [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=251.85999999999999s)]
*  of the conflicts within society now to have this government so rapidly taken over by businesspeople. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=260.22s)]
*  I am concerned about not only the many actions that the president has taken to exceed his [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=268.34s)]
*  powers under the Constitution, but also the influence of private, unelected representatives [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=279.21999999999997s)]
*  of corporations, like Elon Musk, most notably through his role with this shadowy department [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=289.73999999999995s)]
*  of government efficiency, which is involved in lots of different agencies. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=297.42s)]
*  In my new role after leaving the EEOC, I've moved on to Public Citizen, which recently [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=303.1s)]
*  filed suit against the Treasury Department because at the orders of the Department of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  Government Efficiency, lots of private information of federal workers, of retirees, of anyone [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=318.02s)]
*  who does business and has financial information stored with the Treasury Department is now [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=324.9s)]
*  in the hands and access has been given over to unknown and unaccountable individuals who [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=331.9s)]
*  are affiliated with Elon Musk, who are affiliated with Doge, which is not a government department. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=342.5s)]
*  The individuals working with Mr. Musk have not gone through the vetting that individuals [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=349.46s)]
*  would normally have to go through in order to have access to that sensitive private information. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=357.58s)]
*  And so Public Citizen filed suit to seek an injunction to seek a stop to this turnover [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=362.46s)]
*  of private information, which there should be government safeguards to protect, but in [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=368.85999999999996s)]
*  this unprecedented sort of mixture of private and public authority through involving oligarchs [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=374.38s)]
*  at the highest levels of our government who are unelected, that needs to be stopped and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=383.86s)]
*  we hope that the courts will step in to put an end to this unprecedented mixture of private [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=389.38s)]
*  and public power and abuse of executive authority. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=397.65999999999997s)]
*  Pilar Gilbride, before we end, can you describe what happened last week when you and two EEOC [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=400.78s)]
*  commissioners were fired? What happened? What time was it? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=407.74s)]
*  So I received the email at around 10.30 p.m. telling me that, you know, again, citing this [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=413.14s)]
*  sort of unbounded authority that the president has to have people that agree with him ideologically [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=420.46s)]
*  serving in his administration, that my services were no longer required. And the email also [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=426.06s)]
*  referred to, again, this concept of gender ideology, this idea that the president wanted [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=433.82s)]
*  to be able to enforce the sex binary, even though, as I mentioned, that's contrary [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=442.04s)]
*  to Supreme Court precedent. And there was also a reference in the email to diversity, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=446.98s)]
*  equity and inclusion, which is, as I'm sure your listeners are aware, has just become [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=453.98s)]
*  sort of a boogeyman and a concept that is being used to tar all sorts of efforts, including [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=459.38s)]
*  the efforts of the EEOC to enforce the civil rights laws, which is what I was doing as [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=468.38s)]
*  general counsel, was overseeing litigation to enforce civil rights laws that have been [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=473.86s)]
*  on the books for, you know, 30, in some cases, 60 years. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=479.18s)]
*  Carla Gilbride, want to thank you for being with us, just fired by Trump as general counsel [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=483.9s)]
*  of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. I'm Amy Goodman with Juan Gonz√°lez. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0i4gMQ9bs&t=488.02s)]
