# Top U.S. & World Headlines — November 4, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp51T8DtL9M)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, War, Peace and the Presidency.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are both headed to Pittsburgh,
*  Pennsylvania today, on the final day of campaigning before Tuesday's election.
*  Harris is scheduled to also hold three other events in Pennsylvania, in Scranton, in Allentown
*  and in Philadelphia.
*  Trump is also heading to Raleigh, North Carolina, Redding, Pennsylvania, and will end in Grand
*  Rapids, Michigan, tomorrow.
*  More than 78 million voters have already cast their ballots.
*  On Sunday, Trump held a rally in Lidditz-Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, where he told supporters
*  he shouldn't have left the White House after losing to Joe Biden four years ago.
*  We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left.
*  I shouldn't have left.
*  I mean, honestly, because we did so—we did so well.
*  During the same rally, Trump also said he wouldn't mind if someone shot through a
*  crowd of journalists covering his rally.
*  And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news.
*  And I don't mind that so much, because I don't mind.
*  I don't mind that.
*  For months, pollsters have predicted the presidential race will come down to seven battleground
*  Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia.
*  But over the weekend, the most prominent pollster in Iowa, Ann Seltzer, released the Des Moines
*  Register poll, which showed Harris has taken a shocking three-point lead in Iowa, which
*  Trump easily won in 2016 and 2020.
*  The poll showed women voters have shifted heavily toward Harris in Iowa, where a six-week
*  abortion ban took effect in July.
*  In related news, thousands took part in a women's march to the White House on Saturday.
*  We got to stand up for democracy.
*  We have to stand up for women's right to have control over her body, control over her
*  life.
*  Women's rights are human rights.
*  And we were back in the hallways.
*  I'm a 77-year-old woman.
*  I remember when women were crying and carrying on with coat hangers and other kinds of means
*  to save their lives.
*  Top United Nations officials are warning again the entire Palestinian population in
*  North Gaza is, quote, at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence.
*  In a warning issued on Friday, the heads of 15 humanitarian groups wrote, quote, the situation
*  unfolding in North Gaza is apocalyptic.
*  The area has been under siege for almost a month, denied basic aid and lifesaving supplies,
*  while bombardment and other attacks continue, unquote.
*  According to UNICEF, Israeli attacks killed more than 50 children over a 48-hour period
*  this weekend in the Jabalia refugee camp.
*  Earlier today, Israeli forces shelled the Kamal Adwan hospital.
*  The hospital's director said multiple children were injured when the Israeli shells struck
*  the pediatric ward and nursery.
*  Israel is also accused of attacking a polio vaccination center in Gaza City, injuring
*  at least four children.
*  On Friday, an Israeli airstrike killed Palestinian photojournalist Bilal Mohammed Rajab, bringing
*  the death toll of journalists killed in Gaza to as high as 183 over the last 13 months.
*  Aid groups fear the humanitarian situation will soon worsen in Gaza, as Israel has officially
*  notified the United Nations that it has cut off ties to UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestine
*  refugees.
*  The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adnanam Ghebreyesus, condemned Israel's
*  move.
*  TEDROS ADNANAM GHEBREYEESUS, UNHCR UNITED STATES FOR UNION AGENCY FOR PALESTIAN REFUGEES
*  This ban will not make Israel safer.
*  It will only deepen the suffering of the people of Gaza and increase the risk of disease outbreaks.
*  On Friday, the Pentagon announced new deployments to the Middle East, including B-52 long-range
*  bombers and ballistic missile defense destroyers.
*  In a statement, the Pentagon said the move was done in part for the, quote, defense of
*  Israel, unquote.
*  Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, a group of progressive lawmakers, led by Rashida Tlaib and Cory Bush,
*  have sent President Biden a letter warning the growing U.S. involvement in regional wars
*  in the Middle East has not been authorized by Congress.
*  The lawmakers wrote, quote, these destructive wars must end, as must any unauthorized U.S.
*  involvement in them, they wrote.
*  Here in New York City, protesters took to the streets Saturday to demand no votes for
*  genocide.
*  Protesters decried both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump for supporting Israel's war
*  on Gaza and refusing to back an arms embargo on Israel.
*  Participants at the protest included Claudia de la Cruz, who's running for president
*  on the Party for Socialism and Liberation ticket.
*  We are here to remind the capitalist state that there is an entire movement of hundreds
*  of thousands of people all across this country that has been demanding a ceasefire, that
*  has been demanding an arms embargo, that has been demanding an end to the expansion of
*  genocide and war in the Middle East, and that we have not been heard, we have not been considered,
*  and in that same way we will engage in our political right not to engage with a two-party
*  system that continuously insists on paying for and bombing babies across the Middle East.
*  Meanwhile in London, pro-Palestinian protesters held a symbolic die-in in front of the British
*  prime minister's office Saturday.
*  In Spain, King Felipe, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and other officials were met with
*  furious crowds as they toured the flood-stricken Valencia region, where at least 214 people
*  died last week.
*  Locals threw mud at the king and his entourage and shouted out,
*  "'Kill her, shame,' and you abandon us," amidst mounting public outrage over the delayed
*  warnings before the disaster and the slow delivery of aid in the flood's wake.
*  In Colombia, the U.N. Biodiversity Summit, known as COP16, ended without a much-sought-after
*  agreement on funding by wealthy countries.
*  Greenpeace International said, quote,
*  "'The world has lost five to 10 percent of all insect species in the last 150 years.
*  There will be no way out of this terrifying biodiversity crisis if global North countries
*  continue to put money above life on our planet,' they said.
*  Negotiators from smaller countries said they had to abandon talks after they stretched
*  past the official end of the summit because they could not afford to change their flight
*  plans.
*  But some good news emerged from the summit as well, including a measure establishing
*  a permanent indigenous consulting body at the U.N. to weigh in on conservation issues.
*  This is Camila Paz-Romero, spokesperson for indigenous peoples at the summit.
*  This is an unprecedented event in the history of multilateral agreements on the environment.
*  The indigenous groups and the local communities of the world are connected through our knowledge
*  systems on how to take care of life and biodiversity.
*  Let's remember the long way we have advanced with this agreement.
*  This new subsidiary organ is an example for the rest of the world.
*  In it, the different parties recognize the constant need for our complete and effective
*  participation.
*  Environmentalists also welcome progress on the Global Oceans Treaty, which groups hope
*  will be ratified by June 2025, as well as a new measure for drug companies to share
*  profits from products based on genetic data derived from nature.
*  Moldova's EU-aligned president, Maesandu, has won a second term following a runoff vote,
*  which pitted the incumbent against a pro-Moscow opponent.
*  Maesandu's national security adviser accused Russia of massive interference.
*  This is President Maesandu at her victory speech.
*  Moldova has been under an unprecedented attack in the history of all Europe.
*  Dirty money, illegal vote buying, the interference in electoral processes by hostile forces from
*  outside the country and by criminal groups, lies, sowing hatred and fear within our society.
*  Our people have united and freedom and the citizens have won.
*  Peace and hope for a better life have prevailed.
*  Meanwhile, in the Republic of Georgia, prosecutors are investigating allegations of election
*  fraud against President Salome Zurabishvili, refused last week to recognize the parliamentary
*  election victory of the ruling Georgian Dream Party.
*  She accuses Georgian Dream of using Russian-style tactics and propaganda to rig the elections.
*  The EU has suspended Georgia's EU membership process over its foreign influence law passed
*  in June, which critics say is modeled after Russian laws.
*  The Sudanese Doctors' Union says fighters for the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces
*  raped at least 47 people, including three minors, in the eastern Al Jazeera state as
*  campaign against the Sudanese army.
*  An 11-year-old girl died from her bleeding.
*  This comes amidst a spate of recent reports on widespread sexual assaults as the devastating
*  civil war in Sudan rages on.
*  A UN report has accused militia fighters of using rape as part of a genocidal campaign
*  in Darfur to eliminate non-Arab ethnic groups like the Masalit.
*  One survivor said her attacker told her, quote, we will make you give birth to Arab children.
*  groups are reporting an increase in suicides among rape survivors and women who fear being
*  raped.
*  A news from Puerto Rico.
*  An estimated 50,000 people attended a rally Sunday organized by the center-left coalition
*  known as Alianza, or Alliance, ahead of Tuesday's election.
*  The third-party coalition has gained momentum, with Puerto Rican voters disaffected with
*  the two main parties over corruption scandals, austerity policies and the disastrous privatization
*  of the electrical grid.
*  Alianza's gubernatorial candidate, Juan Dalmau, addressed the crowd.
*  As a people, during the last 55 years, we've suffered the consequences of the bipartisan
*  Red and Blue, of a leadership which betrayed the faith that many Puerto Ricans had on them.
*  Our moment to reclaim this country has arrived, to reclaim the government as ours.
*  This is Puerto Rican music superstar Bad Bunny, who also performed at the event.
*  In two days, whether there's thunder, rain or lightning, nothing will stop us from making
*  history.
*  I will never forget how the government abandoned us during the hurricane.
*  This November 5th, this Tuesday, November 5th, we are going to be the storm, and there's
*  nobody who can save them.
*  Bad Bunny and other Puerto Rican celebrities like Fat Joe, who will be appearing with
*  Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania today, recently threw their support behind Harris after a
*  conservative so-called comic at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally called Puerto Rico an
*  Island of Garbage.
*  In Kentucky, a jury found former police officer Brett Hankison guilty of using excessive force
*  and violating the civil rights of Breonna Taylor during the raid that killed Taylor
*  in 2020.
*  Taylor was a black 26-year-old emergency technician.
*  It's the first conviction of any of the Louisville police officers involved in the
*  botched raid.
*  A judge will sentence Hankison on March 12th, just one day ahead of the five-year anniversary
*  of Breonna Taylor's death.
*  He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
*  And the musical icon Quincy Jones has died at the age of 91.
*  During a seven-decade career, the trailblazing producer, arranger and performer won 28 Grammys
*  and helped transform the sound of popular music from producing Michael Jackson's
*  thriller to overseeing the all-star recording of We Are the World.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
