*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel's intensifying its attacks across the Gaza Strip, from Ra'a to Jabalia, the
*  largest refugee camp in Gaza, the official death toll has now topped 35,000, including
*  more than 14,500 children.
*  According to the United Nations, more than 360,000 Palestinians have fled Ra'a, despite
*  fears there's nowhere to go to escape the Israeli bombardment.
*  There's no safe place.
*  The situation is very hard.
*  There's no food, no drinks.
*  Even the water is hard to get.
*  My children cry and tell me, Mother, we want to drink.
*  And I don't know what to do.
*  Unlike everyone else who left Ra'a and came here, and we are displaced here, but there's
*  no safe place.
*  The situation is really hard.
*  Palestinian health officials are warning the entire system in Gaza is hours from collapse
*  due to a massive fuel shortage following Israel's seizure of the Ra'a border crossing.
*  Over the weekend, Israel ordered the forced evacuation of the Kuwaiti hospital in Ra'a.
*  Israel's attack on Ra'a faces growing international condemnation.
*  On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israel should, quote,
*  get out of Gaza, unquote.
*  Meanwhile, Israel's advance on northern Gaza is forcing many displaced Palestinians
*  in Gaza City to flee again.
*  What happened with us is that the Israeli forces dropped flyers on us to evacuate the
*  camp as there will be strikes.
*  We left the camp, but we don't know where to go.
*  We don't know where to head.
*  We don't have food or drink or clothes.
*  What do they want from us?
*  They're killing us and our children.
*  Shame on them.
*  What should we do?
*  We're staying on the streets.
*  This is just so unjust.
*  Have some mercy on us, Arabs, Muslims, Americans.
*  Have mercy on us.
*  We're being slaughtered.
*  Shame on you.
*  We're all being killed.
*  Shame on you.
*  Why are you doing this to us?
*  Pro-Palestinian students staged protests at college graduations across the United States
*  over the weekend.
*  At Duke University, scores of students walked out of comedian Jerry Seinfeld's commencement
*  address.
*  At the University of California, Berkeley, Saturday's commencement ceremony was interrupted
*  a number of times by students.
*  A day earlier, at the UC Berkeley Law School commencement, eight students wore shirts spelling
*  the phrase, UC divest.
*  In other news from California, riot police made one arrest outside Pomona College's
*  commencement, which was moved after students set up a Gaza solidarity encampment on the
*  main graduation stage.
*  Meanwhile, at Virginia Commonwealth University, scores of students staged a silent Gaza walkout
*  during Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin's commencement address.
*  —our visitors, deans, the colleges, faculty, staff, family, friends.
*  In the name of this day, for Mother's Day—
*  This comes as the police crackdown continues on student protests.
*  On Friday, police raided an encampment at the University of Pennsylvania, arresting
*  at least 33 protesters.
*  In Cambridge, Massachusetts, police arrested 10 students who had relaunched an encampment
*  at MIT.
*  Police have now made nearly 3,000 arrests at student-led protests over the past month.
*  Meanwhile, the trustees at the Union Theological Seminary, which is affiliated with Columbia
*  University, have voted to divest from, quote,
*  Companies substantially and intractably benefiting from the war in Palestine, unquote.
*  In related news, students at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore have ended their two-week-old
*  encampment after school officials agreed to consider divesting from Israel.
*  On the international front, professors at the University of Amsterdam are staging a
*  walkout today.
*  This comes a week after police used a bulldozer to violently break up a student Gaza encampment.
*  A new report by the U.S. State Department has concluded Israel likely used U.S. weapons
*  in violation of U.S. and international law, but the report claims the Biden administration
*  has not yet found specific instances that could force the U.S. to withhold military
*  aid.
*  The findings came in a report issued Friday to Congress.
*  Former State Department official Josh Paul, who resigned over Biden's Gaza policy, criticized
*  what he described as a self-contradictory report.
*  It does say that it is reasonable to assume that U.S. weapons have been used to commit
*  violations of international humanitarian law, and yet it does not say that Israel has violated
*  international humanitarian law.
*  It does say that Israel has restricted humanitarian assistance into Gaza, and yet it says that
*  currently Israel is not restricting U.S.-funded humanitarian assistance in Gaza, which is
*  an absurd thing to say, given that the IDF is at this moment closing and has closed for
*  several days the Rafah crossing point, which is the main entry point for humanitarian assistance.
*  The United Nations General Assembly voted 143 to 9 Friday in support of Palestine becoming
*  a full U.N. member.
*  Twenty-five countries abstained from the vote.
*  The United States and Israel both voted against the measure.
*  The vote grants new rights and privileges to Palestine, but not full U.N. membership,
*  which requires support from the U.N. Security Council.
*  Last month, the U.S. vetoed a Palestine statehood resolution at the Security Council.
*  On Friday, Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour urged nations to support Palestine becoming
*  a state.
*  RYAD MANSOUR, Palestinian Ambassador to Palestine
*  A yes vote is a vote for Palestinian existence.
*  It is not against any state, but it is against the attempts to deprive us of our state.
*  Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdogan, protested the vote by shredding
*  a copy of the U.N. charter at the podium.
*  GILAD ERDOGAN, Israeli Ambassador to Palestine
*  You are shredding the U.N. charter with your own hands.
*  Yes, yes, that's what you're doing, shredding the U.N. charter.
*  Shame on you.
*  In another development, Egypt has announced it will join South Africa's genocide case
*  against Israel at the International Court of Justice.
*  Three Israeli whistleblowers who worked at a military detention camp in the Negev Desert
*  have detailed a CNN horrific abuse faced by Gazans detained since October 7th.
*  One whistleblower shared photographs that show Palestinians being strapped down, blindfolded
*  and held in diapers at the site.
*  Doctors have been forced to amputate the limbs of some prisoners due to injuries sustained
*  from constant handcuffing.
*  One whistleblower said they beat Palestinians not to gather intelligence, but out of revenge.
*  In other news from Israel, protests against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his
*  war cabinet are continuing, as Israel marks its first Memorial Day since the October 7th
*  attacks.
*  Earlier today, relatives of dead soldiers heckled Israel's far-right National Security
*  Minister Itamar Ben-Gavir as he spoke at a military cemetery.
*  On Saturday, relatives of hostages held in Gaza staged another protest in Tel Aviv.
*  Nama Weinberg is the cousin of Ite Svirsky, who reportedly died in captivity.
*  It is because of Netanyahu that there is no hostage release deal and there are no hostages
*  being brought back home.
*  He is abandoning our families to their death for his own political interests.
*  Entering Ra'afah and expanding the operations there are both hindering the hostages' release
*  negotiation and putting the hostages' lives in grave danger.
*  So long as Netanyahu is in power, the hostages will not return.
*  He does not want them to return.
*  In other international news, Russian President Vladimir Putin has removed Sergey Shulgin
*  from defense minister.
*  Shoigu had served in the role since 2012 and had overseen Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*  He's being replaced by the economist Andrey Belosov.
*  This comes, as Russia says, it's captured nine more villages in Ukraine's Kharkiv region.
*  In recent days, thousands of Ukrainians have evacuated their homes as Russia expands its
*  attack near the city of Vovchansk.
*  Meanwhile, at least 15 people died in the Russian city of Belgarad after a downed Ukrainian
*  missile hit an apartment building.
*  In Sudan, Doctors Without Borders says two children were killed and others injured overnight
*  Sunday when a bomb filled outside a pediatric hospital in the western city of El Fasher,
*  the capital of North Darfur.
*  Also on Sunday were reports of another 27 deaths there as the Sudanese army clashed
*  with the RSF, the Rapid Support Forces, as fear's mount of possible carnage, in the
*  last major stronghold of the army.
*  Some 800,000 internally displaced people have taken refuge in El Fasher, which was once
*  thought to be relatively shielded from the war.
*  A Tunisian Lawyers Association has called for a nationwide strike after mass police
*  officers raided Tunisia's Bar Association offices and arrested a prominent lawyer.
*  Sonia Damani is an outspoken critic of the government of the Tunisian president, Kayis
*  Zayed, and said in a TV interview last week half of Tunisia's youth want to leave Tunisia.
*  She was being questioned about black African migrants who have been expelled from Tunisia.
*  Damani's arrest was captured on a live French news broadcast as a reporter was covering
*  her persecution by the government.
*  Two journalists were also arrested Saturday as part of the ongoing crackdown on dissent.
*  On Sunday, protesters took to the streets of Tunis.
*  This is Ahmed Najib Chepi, head of the opposition alliance.
*  AMED NAJIB CHEPI, Opposition Leader, Tunisia
*  Today, people are being arrested for anything, absolutely anything.
*  On top of all that, we are undermining the upcoming elections.
*  Tunisia will be on the brink of crisis and collapse.
*  Therefore, we advocate for holding the elections on the scheduled date, ensuring they are conducted
*  within the framework of freedom and equal opportunity.
*  In Afghanistan, flash floods have killed at least 315 people in northern villages.
*  Another 1,600 have been injured, and thousands of homes have been destroyed or damaged, as
*  have health facilities and essential infrastructure.
*  The flash floods destroyed our homes.
*  I lost 13 members of my family, including women and children.
*  So many livestocks have been destroyed as well.
*  We have no food, no drinking water, no shelter, no blankets, nothing at all.
*  The floods have destroyed everything.
*  Out of 42 houses, only two or three houses remained.
*  The floods have destroyed the entire valley.
*  The affected area is in dire need of assistance, but Afghanistan has seen its international
*  aid slash following the Taliban takeover in 2021.
*  In Indonesia, flooding and mudslides in West Sumatra killed at least 43 people over the
*  weekend, with over a dozen others missing.
*  The monsoon downpours also triggered cold lava flow, a thick mixture of volcanic ash
*  and other debris.
*  In Canada, over 100 active wildfires are burning, prompting evacuation orders in British Columbia
*  and Alberta.
*  Authorities in Minnesota issued the state's first air quality alert of the year Sunday
*  as wildfire smoke drifted across the border.
*  In Spain, the ruling Socialist Party won a majority of seats in the Catalan elections
*  Sunday and a major upset for the region's separatist movement.
*  If the Socialists can forge a ruling coalition with other parties, it will be the first
*  Catalan government in over a decade led by a party which does not support independence.
*  Former President Donald Trump will be back in court today for the fourth week of witness
*  testimony in his criminal hush money and election interference trial.
*  Trump's former fixer, attorney Michael Cohen, is set to testify today.
*  Meanwhile, The New York Times and ProPublica have revealed Trump could be forced to pay
*  more than $100 million to the IRS for improperly claiming tax write-offs on a Chicago skyscraper
*  by writing off the same losses twice.
*  And jury selection begins today in the corruption trial of New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob
*  Menendez.
