Amid the indiscriminate dismantling of the federal government by the Trump administration's Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, federal workers, thousands of whom could lose their jobs, are fighting back. "All of us do something not only essential, but also mandated by Congress," says union organizer and Army Corps of Engineers employee Chris Dols. Dols is part of a growing movement of federal workers and their allies staging mass protests to "Save Our Services" and warning of the long-term consequences of these extreme cuts to the bureaucracy. "They're trying to immiserate the working class, and they're doing it through the federal workforce," says Dols, who is also a national coordinator with the Federal Unionists Network. "It's about gutting the services that create a safety net in this country, because the more miserable we are, the easier it is for them to exploit us." He calls on the larger public to join the worker-led movement resisting these radical cuts. "The whole public sphere is at stake."

# "Grand Theft Government": Federal Workers Send SOS over Musk's DOGE, Mass Firings & Service Cuts
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY)
*  Democracy depends on a free press. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=0.0s)]
*  Please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=2.64s)]
*  federal workers and supporters rallied in cities across the United States Wednesday [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=6.24s)]
*  to call for an end to mass firings ordered by President Trump and Doge, the so-called [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=11.86s)]
*  Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=17.2s)]
*  Their demand? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=19.84s)]
*  S.O.S. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=20.84s)]
*  Save our services. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=21.84s)]
*  In just one example of the impact of the cuts, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Tuesday [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=23.68s)]
*  it was seeking to rehire several agency employees who'd been assigned to the federal government's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=28.8s)]
*  response to the H5N1 avian flu outbreak before their jobs were terminated as part of the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=33.96s)]
*  Trump administration's mass firings. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=40.64s)]
*  In a statement, the USDA said the workers were fired in error since their jobs are considered [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=43.24s)]
*  quote public safety positions. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=48.0s)]
*  Here in New York, public workers held several rallies Wednesday. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  In a minute, we'll speak with one of the organizers. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  First, this is Democratic Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez addressing workers and their [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=57.62s)]
*  supporters who gathered in the bitter cold at an S.O.S. rally in Foley Square Wednesday [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=62.94s)]
*  night. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=68.42s)]
*  Elon Musk is not going after efficiency. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=69.42s)]
*  He's not going after making these things better for people. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=73.18s)]
*  He's trying to steal Medicaid so that he can enrich himself. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=78.34s)]
*  He is trying to steal and gut NASA to align his pockets with SpaceX. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=85.06s)]
*  He is trying to gut everything that is good in America for his own private profit. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=96.06s)]
*  This is the culmination of what oligarchy is all about and what oligarchy seeks to do. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=108.06s)]
*  It's the fusion and the capture by the billionaire class of our democracy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=117.06s)]
*  That's what they're trying to do. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=126.06s)]
*  But it's very important to understand that it is not sustainable. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=130.06s)]
*  They may seem like they have power right now, but all of this dramatic action is trying [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=137.06s)]
*  to create the sense of inevitability, the sense of power, so that we abdicate in advance. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=146.06s)]
*  I want everyone who is here and folks who are watching who are not here, especially [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=155.06s)]
*  our federal workers, to listen to me very carefully because we have very specific instructions [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=161.06s)]
*  in this moment. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=167.06s)]
*  And I don't say this as a Democrat. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=168.06s)]
*  I don't say this as a person with any sort of specific political views in this moment. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=171.06s)]
*  I say this as an American who has sworn an oath to the United States Constitution. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=175.06s)]
*  And as someone who cares about this Constitution and who cares about this country, we have [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=182.06s)]
*  an obligation to resist kings. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=189.06s)]
*  We have an obligation to resist oligarchs. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=192.06s)]
*  We have a sworn duty to this nation to resist oligarchy, including any billionaire that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=196.06s)]
*  tries to undermine our Constitution. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=203.06s)]
*  And that is not for sale. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=206.06s)]
*  That was Democratic Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez addressing the Save Our Services [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=210.06s)]
*  protest in Foley Square in Manhattan Wednesday night. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=216.06s)]
*  On Wednesday afternoon, hundreds also protested outside the federal building in New York City [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=219.06s)]
*  as part of the National Day of Action to support public workers being purged as part of the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=224.06s)]
*  Trump administration's cuts under the Department of Government Efficiency led by the billionaire [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=229.06s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=234.06s)]
*  For more, we're joined by someone who still works in the building for now, national coordinator [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=235.06s)]
*  with the Federal Unionist Network, who helped organize the Day of Action. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=240.06s)]
*  Chris Dole works for the Army Corps of Engineers. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=244.06s)]
*  Welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=247.06s)]
*  Can you talk about what's happening across the country, with people getting emails at [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=249.06s)]
*  various times in the day to leave their work toâ€”that they are fired? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=253.06s)]
*  And then, in the case of nuclear safety workers, in the case of what disease detectors within [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=260.06s)]
*  the CDC, as we're dealing with an avian flu epidemic, a number of them, the government [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=267.06s)]
*  then tries to refine them because they've cut off their government email to say, whoops, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=273.3s)]
*  we made a mistake. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=278.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=279.06s)]
*  Before I start, I need to, by government regulation, disclaim, because you mentioned my employer, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=280.06s)]
*  anything I say is my opinion, my personal capacity, and does not reflect the views necessarily [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=285.98s)]
*  of the Army Corps of Engineers. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=291.66s)]
*  And I am the president of my local and, like you said, a coordinator with the Federal Unionist [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=294.06s)]
*  Network. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=298.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, they're really not after efficiency. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=299.64000000000004s)]
*  The attacks on probationary employees is making it much, much harder for all of us who remain. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  And can I just make a clarification on probationary? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=309.38s)]
*  of thousands of workers, and they can be people who work under two years, but they can also [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=312.5s)]
*  be someone who worked for 30 years, was promoted. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=317.5s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=319.94s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=320.94s)]
*  And that then becomes a probationary period, and they can be fired within that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=321.94s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=325.58s)]
*  There are two categories of probationary employees. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=326.58s)]
*  Those who have just started with the federal government in the last one or two years, depending [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=328.42s)]
*  on which agency, and yes, those who are, for whatever reason, changed job series and moved [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=331.66s)]
*  to a different part of the federal government but are otherwise long-time federal employees. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=337.5s)]
*  I think there's a misconception that all probationary employees are recent college grads or something [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=342.14s)]
*  like that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=347.34s)]
*  But, like myself, I started with the federal government after working for seven and a half [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=348.34s)]
*  years with a dredging contractor, and it was my dredging expertise that made me a good [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=352.62s)]
*  cost engineer for the Army Corps. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=358.66s)]
*  The person who I spoke with last night was a lawyer who spent years in the private sector [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=362.82000000000005s)]
*  and brought his legal expertise to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to help protect [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=369.74s)]
*  against fraud there. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=373.90000000000003s)]
*  So the probationary workforce is an extremely qualified workforce in the government. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=375.34000000000003s)]
*  And I think the fact that they're going after such high-quality employees, be they a probationary [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=381.02000000000004s)]
*  or not, matches up with the chaos that they're sowing, where they themselves now have to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=388.34s)]
*  make up for the fact that they summarily fired all these people and have to go rehire them [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=394.74s)]
*  because, oh, it turns out they were doing something essential. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=398.98s)]
*  Well, it turns out all of us are doing something not only essential but mandated by Congress. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=400.78s)]
*  None of us do anything that's not mandated by Congress, which, of course, gets at the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=405.74s)]
*  deeper constitutional crisis element of what we're talking about here, the fact that all [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=410.5s)]
*  three branches of government are on board with this really begs the question of where [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=415.5s)]
*  the checks and balances are going to come from, and that's where the federal workforce [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=419.94s)]
*  and the broader workforce and labor movement need to step in because we're the checks and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=423.06s)]
*  we're the balances that are going to be able to stop this before they go any further. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=427.9s)]
*  So Chris, say, what is your message to other labor unions across the country? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=431.78s)]
*  Yeah, so we picked the slogan Save Our Services SOS on purpose. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=436.09999999999997s)]
*  This is a distress signal coming from us in the federal sector. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=439.85999999999996s)]
*  Yes, our workforce is under direct immediate attack, and a lot of the media wants to tell [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=443.3s)]
*  the human interest story about how our family lives, our lives are being disrupted. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=448.66s)]
*  And yes, that's a story. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=455.38000000000005s)]
*  But the bigger story, what they're really after, is to gut the services that all Americans [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=456.54s)]
*  depend on. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=461.34000000000003s)]
*  You think about how many of us depend on home health aides. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=462.38000000000005s)]
*  You think about the subsidies to schools that come through the Department of Education. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=465.54s)]
*  You think about Medicaid that's now on the chopping block or veterans' health care. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=469.38000000000005s)]
*  All the essential stuff that affects our ability to live our lives, that's what they're after. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=472.98s)]
*  Because from Elon Musk's point of view, the more miserable we are, the less likely we [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=478.42s)]
*  are to fight back. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=483.1s)]
*  They're trying to immiserate the working class, and they're doing it through the federal [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=484.86s)]
*  workforce. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=488.34000000000003s)]
*  It's not about efficiency. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=489.34000000000003s)]
*  It's not about the federal workforce. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=490.42s)]
*  It's about gutting the services that create a safety net in this country because the more [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=491.94s)]
*  miserable we are, the easier it is for them to exploit us. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=496.18s)]
*  And you think, in fact, that they're going to come after private sector employees as [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=499.38s)]
*  well? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=502.86s)]
*  I mean, they are. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=503.86s)]
*  They're already going after the NLRB. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=504.86s)]
*  Explain the National Labor Relations Board, how that connects the two. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=505.86s)]
*  Yeah, the National Labor Relations Board is staffed by federal workers, many of whom are [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=509.98s)]
*  active in the federal unionist network alongside folks from all the agencies. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=514.1s)]
*  And at the NLRB, their job is to uphold the right to organize, the ability to keep an [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=518.94s)]
*  abusive boss in check, all the things that allow for workers to push back against their [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=524.68s)]
*  exploitation and the abuse of management. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=531.22s)]
*  People like Elon Musk, you know, really big bullies in their workplaces. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=533.34s)]
*  That is enshrined by law and it's carried out by the NLRB. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=537.86s)]
*  And they've already pursued unprecedented attacks on that agency. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=541.9399999999999s)]
*  And we know it's going to get worse. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=546.34s)]
*  We know that Elon Musk has lawsuits that he's hoping to get in front of the Supreme Court [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=547.46s)]
*  soon to actually declare the NLRA, which is the act that established the NLRB, unconstitutional. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=550.9399999999999s)]
*  So. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=557.26s)]
*  And do you think there's a relationship between the fact that there are complaints against [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=558.3s)]
*  Elon Musk? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=561.86s)]
*  Of course. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=562.86s)]
*  At the NLRB and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, two of the first agencies he went [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=563.86s)]
*  after? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=569.38s)]
*  Totally. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=570.38s)]
*  And the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=571.38s)]
*  You know, Tesla has a financing operation that is meant to be regulated by the Consumer [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=572.38s)]
*  Financial Bureau. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=577.54s)]
*  And go figure, the man is going after the very agencies that regulate his businesses. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=579.38s)]
*  So we're putting out the distress signal to the broader labor movement that we all have [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=584.62s)]
*  to enter the streets, that we all have to create. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=588.62s)]
*  They're creating the crisis. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=592.02s)]
*  We're not the ones creating the crisis, but they think they can manage the crisis. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=593.02s)]
*  Our job is to prove to them that it's unmanageable and to make it unmanageable. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=596.38s)]
*  You know, this is grand theft government. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=602.38s)]
*  They are pursuing the biggest theft in world history, probably, given the scale that we're [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=604.14s)]
*  talking about. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=609.98s)]
*  And it's going to be up to not just federal workers but to the broader public, because [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=612.46s)]
*  it's the whole public sphere that's at stake. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=615.22s)]
*  So if I can plug our, you know, the place to get involved, whether or not you're a [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=617.46s)]
*  federal worker or you just want to support the federal workforce because you see the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=621.5s)]
*  attacks, it's go.savepublicservices.com. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=624.58s)]
*  And there you can sign up, and we'll make sure to plug you into all the actions that [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=628.6800000000001s)]
*  are coming ahead, because this will be weeks or months, but we can stop them if we mobilize. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=632.22s)]
*  Chris Doles is a union organizer and Army Corps of Engineer employee, national coordinator [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mivuit7BenY&t=635.66s)]
