A legal battle is continuing between the Trump administration and a federal judge over the president's invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to expel over 130 immigrants from the United States to a "mega-prison" in El Salvador over claims that they are members of a Venezuelan gang. Margaret Cargioli, an attorney who is representing one of the men, an LGBTQ asylum seeker who did not have a deportation order when he was effectively disappeared by ICE, says the unilateral expulsion of asylum seekers is "extremely unusual and concerning." Cargioli's client "was not deported. He was sent there unlawfully," and his disappearance not only puts his asylum case at risk, but also his life. CECOT, the prison in El Salvador that the Venezuelan nationals were sent to, is infamous for torture and other human rights abuses, while Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele's authoritarian rule has been marked by a long-running suspension of due process rights. Juan Pappier, who has investigated the prison system in El Salvador for Human Rights Watch, says "people who are sent to CECOT will never be allowed out."

*  He's investigated the prison system in El Salvador. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=78.88s)]
*  Margaret Cargioli, let's begin with you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=82.16s)]
*  Tell us about the person who was sent to the maximum security prison in El Salvador. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=84.52s)]
*  Our client is an asylum seeker who entered the United States via the U.S. southern border [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  through the CBP-1 app over a year ago. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  He was detained in southern California, was waiting for his right to have, you know, a [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=103.66s)]
*  judge hear his case as to asylum. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=109.28s)]
*  He was flagged because he has tattoos. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=112.34s)]
*  He's in the arts field. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=114.94s)]
*  Solely because he has tattoos, the only evidence that the government at that point had submitted [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=117.46s)]
*  were pictures of what they attribute, Tren de Agua, Aragua, gang members to have just [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=122.82s)]
*  one page of a few tattoos. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=131.18s)]
*  And solely because of that, having no criminal record, he has been sent to a very dangerous [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=134.26s)]
*  place where we fear for his safety. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=141.46s)]
*  You don't want to use his name. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=145.02s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=146.02s)]
*  We are seriously concerned for his well-being, his safety, and he is an asylum seeker. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=147.02s)]
*  He fled Venezuela because of persecution, and so we have to keep some of the details [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=152.66s)]
*  of his case private. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=158.02s)]
*  And it's extremely concerning that the United States government is not sharing any information. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=160.10000000000002s)]
*  He did not know his whereabouts from Friday until Monday when he had an immigration court [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=165.58s)]
*  hearing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=171.9s)]
*  At that hearing, it was the first time that the United States government actually confirmed [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=172.94000000000003s)]
*  that he was sent to El Salvador. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=178.5s)]
*  Now, just to understand, he was deported? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=180.58s)]
*  Would you use that term, deported, even though there was no order of deportation? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=186.9s)]
*  There was no order of deportation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=193.16000000000003s)]
*  There was no order of removal. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=196.1s)]
*  He was not deported. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=197.1s)]
*  He was sent there unlawfully. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=198.34s)]
*  He still has a pending immigration court hearing that's coming up very soon, and he has a [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  right to seek asylum. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=206.34s)]
*  What happened here is extremely unusual and concerning. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=208.26s)]
*  So, my question is, why was he sent to, among many other questions, El Salvador? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=212.3s)]
*  Juan Papier, if you can talk, from your Human Rights Watch perspective, about this prison, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  this supermax prison, CICOT, in San Salvador, that these prisoners have been sent to and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=226.06s)]
*  the deal the Trump administration has made with their ally, the president of El Salvador, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=233.06s)]
*  with Bukele. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=240.82s)]
*  Bukele. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=241.82s)]
*  Amy, thank you for having me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=242.82s)]
*  The CICOT, the Center for Confinement of Terrorists in El Salvador, is a mega prison, inaugurated [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=246.14s)]
*  in 2023. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=252.06s)]
*  It was initially announced for 20,000 the Tainis, and the president then doubled the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=253.06s)]
*  capacity to 40,000 the Tainis. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=257.14s)]
*  It has 256 cells, where the Tainis are expected to share a bed. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=260.06s)]
*  The access to the media and to human rights organizations, such as Human Rights Watch, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=266.18s)]
*  is severely restricted, and the government has publicly said that people who are sent [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=270.70000000000005s)]
*  to the CICOT will never be allowed out. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=275.82000000000005s)]
*  We have not been able to identify any of the Tainis who have left CICOT, but we have every [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=278.70000000000005s)]
*  reason to believe that people held there are subject to a similar treatment as in other [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=284.46000000000004s)]
*  prisons in El Salvador, that is torture, deaths in prison and enforced disappearances. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=289.1s)]
*  completely cut off from the rest of the world and denied any legal, any meaningful access [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=295.98s)]
*  to legal recourse. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  This is an effort to create a Guantanamo steroids to put these people outside of the protections [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  of the law, both in the United States and in El Salvador. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=310.74s)]
*  So let's talk about, in 2023, the U.S. State Department report noted El Salvador had harsh [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=314.06s)]
*  and life-threatening prison conditions. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=320.98s)]
*  Can you talk about your thoughts as the Trump administration has agreed to pay the government [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=324.35999999999996s)]
*  of President Naib Bukele $6 million for a year of services to accept people removed [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=329.32s)]
*  forcefully from the United States? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  As this lawyer, Margaret Cardioli, is describing, disappeared from the United States. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=337.88s)]
*  This is an open violation of the United States' obligations under international law, because [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=344.23999999999995s)]
*  they are sending people to a place where they have serious risk of being tortured and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=350.84s)]
*  subject to human rights violations, in addition to the violations by denying them the possibility [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  of seeking asylum in the United States. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=361.29999999999995s)]
*  We have documented in prisons in El Salvador cases of torture, of enforced appearances, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=363.91999999999996s)]
*  conditions in detention that are dismal and massive arbitrary arrests of people who have [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  nothing to do with the gangs in El Salvador who are being held in these prisons as well. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=374.44s)]
*  These are dismal conditions in these prisons, and I am very worried about the safety of [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=379.64s)]
*  these migrants who have been sent there. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  It's worth noting that the government, the governments of the United States and El Salvador [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=387.76s)]
*  have not released a list of people sent there, nor any indications that they effectively [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  are part of the Venezuelan gang known as Tren de Agua. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=396.64s)]
*  What, something like 261 people died in El Salvador's prisons. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=400.32s)]
*  Can you talk about‚Äîjust last year? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=405.8s)]
*  Can you talk about what you know about the torture, the lack of medical attention, the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  abuse that occurs not only at Seacot, but in these other prisons that the U.S. has now [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=412.91999999999996s)]
*  made a deal with the president of Salvador to house U.S. prisoners? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=417.96s)]
*  Local human rights groups in El Salvador have recorded 350 cases of detainees who have died [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  in prisons since March 2022, when a state of emergency began in El Salvador. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=431.74s)]
*  The country has been in this state of emergency for three years now. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=438.04s)]
*  That means that constitutional due process rights are suspended. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=441.44s)]
*  And we at Human Rights Watch have documented many of the cases of people who died in prison, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=447.0s)]
*  and we have identified evidence of state responsibility of some of these deaths. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=451.88s)]
*  We have reviewed these cases with forensic experts and identified evidence of possible [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=457.2s)]
*  torture leading to some of these violations. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=462.94s)]
*  These are the conditions where these people are being held that are, as the State Department [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=466.4s)]
*  held in its 2023 report on human rights, life-threatening. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=470.2s)]
*  So I think it's very shameful to see Secretary of State Rubio say that these are very good [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=475.12s)]
*  prisons. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=483.0s)]
*  These are prisons with life-threatening conditions. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=484.0s)]
*  So Margaret Cardioli, have you talked to your client? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=487.44s)]
*  We have not been able to speak to our client. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=491.71999999999997s)]
*  We did reach out to the Department of Homeland Security, and yesterday we're told that they [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=494.04s)]
*  cannot facilitate communication with our client because he's been removed. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=498.72s)]
*  We are hoping that with public pressure and through federal litigation, we are able to [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=503.42s)]
*  soon talk to our client, find out information as to exactly where he is, what conditions [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=509.8s)]
*  he's being held under, and also to find out exactly what transpired. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=515.96s)]
*  How is it that an asylum seeker detained in the United States with an immigration attorney [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=521.16s)]
*  disappears for several days and ends up in a maximum security prison in a third country? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=528.04s)]
*  Can Federal Judge Boesberg, who is hearing trying to get answers from the U.S. government, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=536.4s)]
*  Pam Bondi, the attorney general, says they don't have to respond with specific answers [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=543.04s)]
*  about how these deportations have happened? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=547.78s)]
*  Can he play a role in getting your client back? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=550.88s)]
*  Yes, our client actually does fit under the class within that lawsuit. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7CoDZol7E&t=554.72s)]
