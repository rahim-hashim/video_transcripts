# Top U.S. & World Headlines — September 17, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po3Q3uJMc1A)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he's expanded his goals for the war
*  on Gaza to include the return of Israelis displaced by fighting near the border with
*  Lebanon.
*  Netanyahu's office announced the escalation after an overnight meeting of Israel's Security
*  Cabinet and just hours after Israel's War Chief Yoav Gallant told a senior adviser to
*  Biden, quote,
*  "'The only way left to return the residents of the North to their homes is via military
*  action,' unquote.
*  U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin responded by warning Gallant a full-scale war with Hezbollah
*  would lead to devastating consequences.
*  The Palestinian Education Ministry reports Israeli attacks have killed more than 11,000
*  students across the Gaza Strip and occupied West Bank since last October 7th.
*  In one of the latest assaults, at least 20 Palestinians were killed when Israel's military
*  bombed the Al-Berej refugee camp in central Gaza.
*  Five others were killed in attack on Gaza City's Al-Zaytoun neighborhood.
*  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting Egypt today to discuss a potential
*  Gaza ceasefire and the release of hostages.
*  Blinken's visit comes as top experts at the U.N. have strongly condemned the United
*  States and other Western nations for supporting Israel's devastating assault on Gaza.
*  Francesca Abbenesi, the U.N. special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, spoke
*  Monday.
*  I think that it's unavoidable for Israel to become a pariah in the face of its continuous,
*  relentless vilifying assault on the United Nations on top of millions of Palestinians.
*  In campaign news, Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance have seized on Sunday's apparent
*  assassination attempt on Trump to accuse their democratic rivals for their rhetoric, they
*  said.
*  This is Vance at a Faith and Freedom Coalition event in Atlanta Monday.
*  No one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months, and two people
*  now have tried to kill Donald Trump in the last couple of months.
*  I'd say that's pretty strong evidence that the left needs to tone down the rhetoric
*  and needs to cut this crap out.
*  Somebody's going to get hurt by it.
*  Trump ally Elon Musk amplified the Trump campaign message, tweeting then deleting a response
*  user in which the billionaire ex-owner, Elon Musk, mused,
*  "'And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden Kamala,' along with a thinking face
*  emoji."
*  The Secret Service said afterwards it's aware of the post and reiterated it investigates
*  all such threats.
*  Meanwhile, Democratic lawmaker Jamie Raskin, who led the House select committee investigating
*  the January 6th Capitol insurrection, told The Washington Post Kamala Harris and Tim
*  Walls, quote, do not talk about bloodbaths, American carnage, overturning the rule of
*  law or the Constitution, or imprisoning and exacting revenge against their opponents,
*  said Raskin.
*  He added, quote, only one candidate in this race has been impeached in a bipartisan vote
*  for inciting a violent insurrection against our government, unquote.
*  On Monday, 58-year-old Ryan Routh, the suspect in Sunday's apparent assassination attempt
*  at Donald Trump's Florida golf course, appeared in federal court.
*  Prosecutors say Routh spent nearly 12 hours lying in wait with a rifle for Trump before
*  a Secret Service agent fired on him, scuttling his plans to shoot at Trump.
*  This is U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Markensey LaPointe.
*  Routh was charged federally with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession
*  and receipt of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.
*  Markensey LaPointe is the first Haitian-American to serve as U.S. attorney.
*  In Ohio, Republican Governor Mike DeWine announced he's deploying state troopers and conducting
*  daily bomb sweeps in Springfield schools.
*  After racist and inflammatory comments by Trump vans and other Republican officials,
*  Routh's Springfield's Haitian community led to 33 separate bomb threats.
*  During a recent CNN interview about the lies he's helping spread about the Haitian community,
*  J.D. Vance said he's willing to, quote, create stories.
*  The city of Springfield also announced it's canceling its annual Culture Fest that was
*  scheduled for later this month.
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to expand the number of active-duty
*  troops by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million.
*  It's the third increase in troop size since Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.
*  With the decree, it's likely Putin will have to either expand the draft or change Russian
*  law to allow more women into the military.
*  This comes just days after Putin warned the U.S. and its NATO allies against allowing
*  Ukraine to use Western arms to strike deeper inside Russia.
*  If this decision is made, it will mean nothing less than the direct participation of NATO
*  countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine.
*  This is their direct participation.
*  And this, of course, significantly changes the very essence, the very nature of the conflict.
*  On Friday, President Biden shrugged off Putin's threat, telling reporters, quote, I don't
*  think much about Vladimir Putin.
*  Afghanistan's Taliban has suspended a U.N.-led polio eradication effort, ordering a halt
*  to house-to-house vaccinations.
*  It's a major setback to the global polio eradication initiative.
*  So far this year, the World Health Organization has identified 18 polio cases in Afghanistan,
*  triple the number reported—recorded all of last year.
*  In Massachusetts, a man set himself on fire last Wednesday near the Israeli consulate
*  in Boston to protest the war on Gaza.
*  He was reportedly hospitalized immediately after with severe burns, but few other details
*  are known.
*  Matt Nelson is believed to be the third person to self-immolate outside an Israeli consulate
*  over the past 11 months.
*  Video has circulated online purportedly of Nelson speaking ahead of his self-immolation.
*  My name is Matt Nelson, and I'm about to engage in an extreme act of protest.
*  We are all culpable in the ongoing genocide in Gaza.
*  We call ourselves the greatest nation in history, yet we spend more on weapons of war than we
*  do on educating our children, helping the homeless, ensuring all Americans have equal
*  rights and protecting the environment combined.
*  We are slaves to capitalism and a military-industrial complex.
*  Most of us are too apathetic to care.
*  The protest I'm about to engage in is a call to our government to stop supplying Israel
*  with the money and weapons it uses to imprison and murder innocent Palestinians, to pressure
*  the Israeli government to end the genocide in Gaza and to support the ICC indictment
*  of Benjamin Netanyahu and other members of the Israeli government.
*  Meanwhile, in Newton, Massachusetts, a U.S. veteran was charged with assaulting and shooting
*  a man who was defending Palestinian rights to a group of pro-Israel protesters.
*  Here in New York, the NYPD is facing public outrage after an officer shot four people
*  following a suspected subway fare evasion.
*  The police officer ended up sending the suspect, two bystanders and another police officer
*  to the hospital.
*  The NYCOU said, quote,
*  This deeply disturbing incident shows why endlessly relying on more police and subways
*  and harsh crackdowns for minor offenses won't bring true community safety, they said.
*  And in Georgia, protesters interrupted Atlanta City Council meeting Monday to demand a public
*  referendum on the massive 85-acre police training complex known as Cop City.
*  Monday's protests came one year after the vote to stop Cop City coalition in Atlanta
*  submitted more than 116,000 signatures calling for a ballot measure on the fate of Cop City,
*  whose estimated budget has ballooned to $110 million.
*  Atlanta officials, led by Mayor Andre Dickens, have so far committed $67 million in public
*  funds to the project while racking up outside legal fees in a bid to keep a referendum off
*  the November ballot.
*  On Monday, protesters released thousands of ping pong balls into the Atlanta City Council
*  chambers and unfurled a banner reading, Andre Dickens, you dropped the ball on democracy.
*  This is Pastor Kiana Jones Moore speaking during a public comment ahead of the protest.
*  If you're so confident in what you have to offer, then give people a choice.
*  Andre Dickens constantly says that this project has overwhelming support.
*  Well, all right then, Andre, why you working so hard to keep people from voting?
*  Because 116,000 people, whether they want Cop City or not, believe that people should
*  be able to vote on the issue.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The Warrant Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
