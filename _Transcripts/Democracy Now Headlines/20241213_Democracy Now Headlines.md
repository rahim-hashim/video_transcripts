# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” December 13, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um6av5uvZE0)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In Syria, tens of thousands of people have gathered at the Great Mosque of Damascus and
*  other cities across the country for the first Friday prayers since longtime authoritarian
*  President Bashar al-Assad was toppled by opposition fighters.
*  The World Food Program is appealing to donors to help it scale up relief operations for
*  some 2.8 million displaced and food-insecure Syrians.
*  That includes more than 1.1 million people uprooted by fighting since late November.
*  Israel's defense minister has told his troops to prepare to spend the winter holding the
*  that separates Syria from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
*  Earlier today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toured the summit of Mount Haramun
*  in the U.N.-designated buffer zone.
*  Netanyahu said this week the Golan Heights would, quote,
*  "'forever be an inseparable part of the state of Israel,'' unquote.
*  On Thursday, the U.N. called for an urgent de-escalation of airstrikes in Syria by Israeli
*  and their withdrawal from the U.N. buffer zone.
*  The secretary-general is deeply concerned by the recent and extensive violations of
*  Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
*  The secretary-general is particularly concerned over the hundreds of Israeli airstrikes on
*  several locations in Syria, stressing the urgent need to de-escalate violence on all
*  fronts throughout the country.
*  In Ankara, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Turkey's foreign minister
*  and the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
*  Blinken said the U.S. and Turkey would work to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State
*  in Syria.
*  Meanwhile, Erdogan told Blinken Turkey reserves the right to strike the U.S.-backed Syrian
*  Democratic Forces, led by the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, which Turkey considers
*  a terrorist organization, after headlines will go to Damascus for the latest on Syria.
*  In Gaza, an Israeli airstrike on Thursday ripped through a post office, sheltering displaced
*  Palestinian families in the Nusayrat refugee camp, killing at least 33 Palestinians, with
*  84 others wounded or missing.
*  Elsewhere, separate Israeli strikes killed at least 13 people in Rafah and Qanyunas.
*  Palestinian medics said those killed were part of a force protecting humanitarian aid
*  trucks.
*  This comes as a new study finds 96 percent of children in Gaza feel their death is imminent.
*  And nearly half said they wish to die.
*  Four out of five children surveyed suffer from nightmares.
*  Nearly three-quarters show signs of aggression.
*  The study was conducted by the charity War Child Alliance, which said in a statement,
*  quote, alongside the leveling of hospitals, schools and homes, a trail of psychological
*  destruction has caused wounds unseen, but no less destructive on children who hold no
*  responsibility for this war, unquote.
*  Meanwhile, Reporters Without Borders warns Palestine remain the most dangerous country
*  in the world for journalists this year.
*  Since October 2023, Israeli attacks have killed more than 145 media workers, which the group
*  condemned as an unprecedented bloodbath, unquote.
*  The Israeli press freedom groups have put the number even higher at nearly 200 journalists
*  killed by Israel.
*  Russia's launched a massive missile and drone attack targeting Ukraine's energy
*  grid, sending Kiev residents underground to seek shelter in the city's metros.
*  This is a mother and daughter who were displaced from Kherson due to the war.
*  Of course, I would rather be going to work and have my child go to school now.
*  As you can see yourself, air raid alert is issued, and we have to go to the shelter to
*  hide from the missiles.
*  It is very difficult, of course.
*  Every night there is an air alarm.
*  My child is always scared.
*  On Thursday, Moscow reissued its threat to retaliate against a Ukrainian attack on a
*  southwestern Russian city, which it says involved U.S.-made Atacom's ballistic missiles.
*  Meanwhile, the U.S. says Russia could soon launch another strike using an intermediate-range
*  hypersonic missile that was deployed for the first time last month.
*  In South Korea, a second motion to impeach President Yun Suk-yul was submitted to the
*  parliament today over Yun's declaration of martial law on December 3.
*  Yun was forced to reverse the order just six hours later amidst widespread outrage and
*  protest.
*  An earlier impeachment motion failed to remove Yun after much of his ruling people, power,
*  party boycotted the vote.
*  Street protests demanding his removal are continuing.
*  French President Emmanuel Macron has appointed centrist ally Francois Bayrou as prime minister
*  following the collapse of the previous government in a no-confidence vote.
*  In choosing Bayrou, Macron once again eschewed widespread calls for him to select a progressive
*  prime minister after a leftist coalition won the largest share of votes in July's snap
*  parliamentary elections.
*  At The Hague, the International Court of Justice has heard more testimony and arguments this
*  on how the unfolding climate catastrophe is creating an existential crisis for low-lying
*  Pacific Island nations.
*  Those countries are demanding wealthy, polluting nations be held legally responsible for addressing
*  the crisis they created.
*  This is Langene Italele Thalia, the attorney general of Tuvalu, which could soon become
*  the first country to be wiped from the face of the earth due to sea level rise.
*  Tuvalu may soon become uninhabitable.
*  In these circumstances, there can be no question that our fundamental right to self-determination
*  is being violated.
*  And in these proceedings, there is unsurprisingly considerable consensus across participants
*  that climate change is impeding the right to self-determination.
*  Today is the last day of hearings at the World Court, which is expected to publish its final
*  advisory opinion on the matter in the new year.
*  In Washington, D.C., police arrested 13 people on Thursday as the nonviolently blockaded
*  the headquarters of the Department of Energy, demanding the Biden administration cancel
*  authorizations for new liquefied natural gas export terminals.
*  Activists say greenhouse gas emissions from the proposed exports would be equivalent to
*  1,000 coal-fired power plants.
*  A new investigation by The Marshall Project finds hospitals across the U.S. are dispensing
*  medications to patients in labor only to report them to child welfare authorities when they,
*  or their newborns, test positive for those very same substances on drug tests.
*  Federal law requires hospitals report positive drug tests to ensure babies who need it can
*  receive treatment for withdrawal.
*  But amidst the increased criminalization of reproductive health care, health experts say
*  hospitals need to put into place more patient safeguards around drug testing.
*  Hospital reports based on the misleading drug tests have led to investigations in even the
*  removal of children from their parents.
*  Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson
*  in New York, is fighting his extradition from Pennsylvania, where he was arrested by authorities
*  Monday.
*  Mangione's lawyer says they're waiting for more evidence related to the charges against
*  him in New York.
*  Meanwhile, the NYPD warned health care executives earlier this week after a hit list of CEOs
*  was posted online.
*  Wanted posters popped up across New York this week featuring photos of health insurance
*  CEOs as the case's galvanized public condemnation of the health insurance industry.
*  In related news, a woman in Florida was arrested and charged this week for threatening to conduct
*  a mass shooting or an act of terrorism after she ended a call to her insurance company
*  Blue Cross Blue Shield with the words, Delay, Deny, Depose.
*  Those three words were found written on bullet casings at the scene of Brian Thompson's
*  shooting.
*  Delay, Deny and Defend are known as the 3 Ds of the health insurance industry.
*  Here in New York, immigrant justice activists rallied outside City Hall to protest Mayor
*  Eric Adams' meeting with Trump's incoming border czar Tom Homan, who's vowed to enact
*  Trump's plans for mass deportations.
*  This is Jennifer Hernandez of Make the Road New York.
*  The mayor should refuse to collaborate with the federal government in the separation of
*  families and make that clear to Tom Homan.
*  Mayor Adams has said he'll cooperate with federal immigration authorities, threatening
*  New York's current status as a sanctuary city.
*  A Palestinian-American man who was convicted and imprisoned in 2008 for his work with the
*  charity Holy Land Foundation has been released from federal prison.
*  Mufid Abdelkader, one of the so-called Holy Land Five, was released to a halfway house
*  on Thursday.
*  Abdelkader and his four co-defendants, Qasem Elashi, Shukri Abu Bakr, Mohammed El Mazen
*  and Abdelrahman Odeh, received sentences up to 65 years under the Bush administration
*  accused of working for a terrorist organization.
*  The Holy Land Foundation raised millions of dollars for Palestinians living under Israeli
*  occupation, making it a target for pro-Israel groups in the U.S.
*  Their case was widely denounced as political persecution during the height of the so-called
*  War on Terror and shuttered what was once the largest Muslim charity in the U.S.
*  Shukri Abu Bakr and Qasem Elashi remain behind bars.
*  Police arrested at least eight protesters at the campus of New York University Thursday
*  as they nonviolently blockaded the university's library to demand NYU divest from companies
*  that profit from Israel's war and occupation of Palestine.
*  Among those arrested were two faculty members, history professor Rebecca Karl and American
*  Studies professor Andrew Ross.
*  They're among six professors and dozens of students who've been declared persona
*  non grata by campus security officials and barred from entering NYU buildings.
*  And New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy assigned a bill to prevent book bans as Republican
*  lawmakers in many other states are working to ban a record number of books from school
*  library shelves.
*  Most of them dealing with gender identity, sexual orientation and racial justice.
*  At the signing ceremony this week, Governor Murphy was introduced by Martha Hickson, a
*  retired high school librarian from Annandale, New Jersey, who endured verbal abuse from
*  some parents who objected to LGBTQ themed books in the school library.
*  According to School Library Journal, nearly half of school librarians reported they had
*  quietly removed books themselves to avoid being the target of a challenge.
*  And those are just the librarians who admitted it.
*  I suspect the number is actually much higher.
*  And I know teachers who will no longer include controversial topics or titles in their classrooms
*  for fear of being targeted too.
*  When this self-censorship happens, it's the students who suffer.
*  They lose the voices and stories that explore the real world beyond their own front door.
*  And our own fear censors the material, so book banners don't have to.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
