*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel's military has once again invaded the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza,
*  its third such offensive in the last year.
*  The Palestinian Red Crescent Society says the assault has left dozens of people dead
*  as soldiers, quote, fire at anyone who moves, unquote.
*  The Palestinian Ministry of Health reports Israeli troops surrounded the Kamal Adwan
*  Hospital and gave medical workers 24 hours to completely empty the hospital of patients
*  and staff.
*  Israel issued similar orders to the Indonesian and Al-Aida hospitals.
*  The orders threatened to collapse the health care system for an estimated 400,000 Palestinians
*  who remain trapped in northern Gaza.
*  In central Gaza, mourners gathered in Dera Balakh earlier today to pray for 17 people
*  killed when Israel bombed tents housing displaced people in the Nusayrat and Borej refugee camps.
*  This is Ragab al-Halidi, who carried the body of his young nephew, Hossam, who was killed
*  in the attack.
*  They were sleeping safely.
*  Why are they targeted with two rockets?
*  What fault did they commit to be targeted with two rockets?
*  Why should we have to get them out of the fire?
*  Israel's military continued its devastating attacks on Lebanon overnight with massive
*  explosions reported in Beirut's southern suburbs and the Baka Valley.
*  The bombings compounded the misery of displaced families, many of whom have been forced to
*  find shelter in open-air encampments in Beirut's streets.
*  We fled from the bombing, from the rockets that were coming at us.
*  Our homes were destroyed.
*  Come and see the people who are displaced here.
*  They have been humiliated.
*  Is there anyone who is not scared of war, especially that we have a child with us?
*  God help us and God help the people.
*  Earlier today, Hezbollah said its fighters repelled two incursions of Israeli troops
*  attempting to invade southern Lebanon.
*  Hezbollah's deputy leader Naim Qassem said in a statement, the group is prepared to
*  negotiate a ceasefire with Israel.
*  Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly addressed the people of
*  Lebanon in an English-language video message boasting Israel had killed Hashem Safedin,
*  who was meant to replace assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
*  Netanyahu warned Lebanon's nearly 6 million inhabitants they could face, quote,
*  destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza, unquote.
*  Do you remember when your country was called the pearl of the Middle East?
*  I do.
*  So what happened to Lebanon?
*  A gang of tyrants and terrorists destroyed it.
*  That's what happened.
*  Lebanon was once known for its tolerance, for its beauty.
*  Today, it's a place of chaos, a place of war.
*  Syrian media is reporting seven civilians were killed and 11 others injured Tuesday
*  in an Israeli air strike in a residential building in a suburb west of the capital,
*  Damascus.
*  Women and children were reportedly among the dead.
*  Israeli officials claim the attack was aimed at killing a Hezbollah official involved in
*  weapons trafficking.
*  U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres says he's written directly to Israeli Prime Minister
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, warning him against dismantling the U.N. agency tasked with providing food,
*  health care and social services to Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
*  Two bills under consideration in Israel's parliament would prevent UNRWA from continuing
*  its essential work.
*  Guterres said passage of the legislation would, quote, be a catastrophe and what's already
*  an unmitigated disaster.
*  Without UNRWA, the delivery of food, shelter and health care to most Gaza's population
*  would grind to a halt.
*  Without UNRWA, Gaza's 660,000 children would lose the only entity that is able to restart
*  education, risking the fate of an entire generation.
*  And without UNRWA, many health, education and social services would also end in the
*  occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.
*  Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant has canceled plans to travel to Washington, D.C., to meet
*  with his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
*  Israeli media is reporting Prime Minister Netanyahu blocked Galant's visit because
*  he first wants to speak with President Biden about Israel's plans to attack Iran in response
*  to Iran's missile attack last week.
*  One of the largest evacuations in Florida's history is underway, after officials urged
*  5.5 million people along Florida's Gulf Coast to seek shelter ahead of Hurricane Milton's
*  expected landfall near Sarasota this evening.
*  As it approached Florida, Milton once again strengthened into a catastrophic Category
*  5 storm.
*  It's forecast to double in size as it crosses the Florida Peninsula, triggering deadly
*  storm surges, winds and torrential downpours.
*  The National Weather Service has warned Milton could be the most powerful hurricane to hit
*  Tampa Bay in over 100 years.
*  Mass evacuations across Tampa and other areas have clogged highways with reports of widespread
*  price gouging, as more than 1,000 gas stations run out of fuel.
*  Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, a climate crisis denier, warned people to stock up on
*  food and water and to prepare for power outages that could last weeks.
*  Meanwhile, Florida's Department of Corrections says it evacuated at least 4,600 incarcerated
*  people, including many prisoners who'd been tasked with cleaning up debris following Hurricane
*  Helene.
*  The Manatee County Jail, however, has refused to evacuate the approximately 1,200 people
*  in its custody despite the life-threatening risks.
*  Early Wednesday, Hurricane Milton churned over the northeast of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula
*  with maximum wind speeds of about 160 miles per hour.
*  Residents are calling on the Mexican government to help with recovery and to spray against
*  mosquitoes carrying disease.
*  This is a fisherman from Celestin, Yucatan.
*  We demand support for the most vulnerable people and, above all, to fumigate, because
*  now there will be a lot of illness, dengue, Zika, a lot of illnesses.
*  I would demand authorities not to abandon the Celestin port.
*  In Bolivia, new data show wildfires have burned a record 25 million acres this year, driven
*  by hot and dry conditions due to the climate crisis.
*  On Tuesday, officials in Bolivia's hard-hit city of Santa Cruz advised residents to stay
*  indoors and wear face masks in open areas as wildfire smoke blanketed the region, triggering
*  air quality alerts.
*  Airline flights were delayed due to poor visibility while school district officials canceled classes.
*  We have many breathing problems.
*  This makes learning more difficult because the students have coughs, sore throats, headaches
*  and itchy eyes.
*  Then it's impossible to hold in-person lessons now.
*  Bolivia's record wildfires come as a scientific study by the organization Forest Declaration
*  Deforestation soared last year with nearly 16 million acres of forest chopped down or
*  burned, an area roughly the size of Ireland.
*  That puts the world behind a target for eliminating deforestation by 2030 agreed to by 140 countries
*  at the UN climate conference in Glasgow three years ago.
*  In Ukraine, two people were killed and more than 30 injured Tuesday as Russian warplanes
*  bombed Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city.
*  Survivors say the attack came almost without warning.
*  I heard that something was flying through the air.
*  I grabbed my child to run away towards the pit behind the building.
*  I sat down and protected her like this, and I heard a shattering sound, and glass shards
*  were everywhere.
*  On Monday, Ukraine's military said it had struck a major oil terminal in the Russian-annexed
*  Crimean peninsula.
*  Meanwhile, Russia used a hypersonic missile to strike a major air base in western Ukraine
*  and attack two civilian cargo ships in the Black Sea Grain Export Hub of Odessa.
*  On Tuesday, the White House said President Joe Biden would skip a four-day trip to Germany
*  to respond to Hurricane Milton.
*  Biden had been expected to attend a summit with Western leaders at the U.S. Air Base
*  in Ramstein to discuss Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's so-called victory plan.
*  Here in New York, one of Mayor Eric Adam's closest allies has resigned from her role
*  as first deputy mayor, making Sheena Wright the seventh senior official to leave the Adams
*  administration amidst multiple federal investigations.
*  Wright's husband, New York City Public Schools Chancellor David Banks, announced last month
*  he would step down just weeks after the FBI raided his home.
*  Wright's resignation comes as Adam's former chief liaison to Muslim New Yorkers, Mohammed
*  Bahi, was arrested and indicted on federal charges of witness tampering and destruction
*  of evidence.
*  This comes as Mayor Eric Adams continues to face mounting calls to resign after becoming
*  New York's first sitting mayor to be federally charged in a bribery and wire fraud scheme
*  spanning nearly a decade.
*  The Biden administration has finalized a rule requiring cities to replace nearly all lead
*  pipes within a decade.
*  Public health experts held the move as a long-overdue measure to protect children, particularly
*  in low-income communities of color, whose tap water is far more likely to contain lead.
*  A recent study in the journal JAMA Pediatrics found more than two-thirds of children six
*  years old and younger in Chicago have been exposed to lead-contaminated drinking water.
*  And prominent Palestinian human rights defender Issa Amro has received the 2024 Wright Livelihood
*  Award for the work of his organization, the Hebron-based Youth Against Settlements.
*  The group, based in the occupied West Bank, was recognized for its, quote,
*  steadfast nonviolent resistance to Israel's illegal occupation promoting Palestinian civic
*  action through peaceful means, end quote.
*  Amro has been detained by Israeli forces several times over his activism, beaten and tortured
*  in Israeli prisons.
*  Other Wright Livelihood winners include British-Israeli architect A.O. Weitzman, who accepted the
*  award on behalf of Forensic Architecture, which has mapped out possible war crimes committed
*  by the Israeli occupation in the Gaza Strip and Palestinian territories.
*  To see our interviews with A.O. Weitzman and Issa Amro, visit our website, DemocracyNow.org.
*  The other Wright Livelihood Award laureates are Indigenous human rights and environmental
*  activist Joan Carling of the Philippines and Annabelle Lemos, a Mozambican environmental
*  activist.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
