# Top U.S. & World Headlines — November 18, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qNCEtREZj0)
*  AMNA NAWAZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, AND THE PEOPLE'S
*  WOMEN'S RIGHTS.
*  Welcome to Democracy Now, DemocracyNow.org, the war and peace report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In a major change of U.S. policy, President Biden has given Ukraine the green light to
*  begin striking inside Russia with U.S.-supplied long-range missiles.
*  The decision comes just two months before Donald Trump takes office and his North Korean
*  troops have begun supporting Russia on the battlefield.
*  The New York Times reports Biden's own aides were divided on the decision, with some fearing
*  this could lead to Russia retaliating against the U.S.
*  Earlier today, the Kremlin accused the Biden administration of adding, quote, oil to the
*  fire.
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke Sunday.
*  Today, there's lots of talk in the media about us receiving permission for respective
*  actions.
*  But strikes are not carried out with words.
*  Such things are not announced.
*  Missiles will speak for themselves.
*  They certainly will.
*  Glory to Ukraine.
*  Over the weekend, Russia launched a massive missile and drone attack on Ukraine's power
*  grid, resulting in major blackouts.
*  The city of Sumi, a Russian missile, hit a residential building, killing 11 people, including
*  two children.
*  Pope Francis has called for an investigation to determine if Israel's war on Gaza constitutes
*  genocide.
*  This comes as the official death toll in Gaza nears 44,000, but that's believed to be a
*  vast undercount.
*  On Sunday, an Israeli airstrike in a residential tower in Beit Lehiya killed as many as 72
*  people.
*  On Saturday, Israel struck a school in Gaza City's Shati refugee camp housing displaced
*  people.
*  At least 10 Palestinians were killed.
*  Another 10 were killed in a strike on the Berej refugee camp.
*  This is Eid Abu Rikab, who lost cousins in the attack.
*  It's one of the biggest crimes, something that doesn't happen anywhere else in the
*  world.
*  Why target peaceful people sitting in their home?
*  What could they possibly have to justify hitting them in their own house?
*  If you want to target military personnel, go and search for them.
*  The one who dies is always the civilian.
*  We were forced to flee from the north and went to Al Mawasi, which they said was a safe
*  place.
*  Then you come and strike there.
*  Israel is continuing to bombard Lebanon despite talk of a possible ceasefire.
*  Al Jazeera reports eight more paramedics have been killed in Lebanon.
*  On Friday, Lebanon's caretaker prime minister urged Iran to persuade Hezbollah to agree
*  to a ceasefire deal with Israel.
*  Meanwhile, Israel's assassinated Hezbollah's media chief, Mohammed Afif.
*  He was killed in an airstrike in central Beirut.
*  Afif was one of the last remaining public faces of Hezbollah.
*  In Israel, three protesters have been detained after flares were fired near the home of Prime
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  The incident occurred as protests continue, calling for a ceasefire deal to free the remaining
*  hostages in Gaza.
*  On Capitol Hill, House Republicans are attempting to once again ram through H.R. 9495, a bill
*  that would allow Trump and future presidents to effectively shut down nonprofits by labeling
*  them a terrorist-supporting organization.
*  The measure could target humanitarian aid groups, news outlets, schools and countless
*  civil society organizations.
*  Congress failed to fast-track the bill last week, falling short of a required two-thirds
*  of majority, despite dozens of Democrats voting in favor along with Republicans.
*  which could happen this week would likely only require a simple majority.
*  A coalition of groups said in a statement, quote,
*  This bill was designed to criminalize organizations and activists who oppose the U.S.'s unconditional
*  support of Israel's genocide of Palestinians and the slaughter of Lebanese civilians, unquote.
*  Signatories to the statement include CARE—that's the Council on American-Islamic Relations—and
*  American Muslims for Palestine.
*  Oxfam criticized the bill, saying Trump could use it to silence and censor critics, curb
*  free speech and target political opponents.
*  Donald Trump has picked fracking executive Chris Wright to be energy secretary.
*  Wright is CEO of Liberty Energy and serves on the board of Oklo, a nuclear power startup.
*  Wright's a vocal supporter of oil and gas development, who has denied climate change
*  is a crisis.
*  There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either.
*  Humans and all complex life on Earth is simply impossible without carbon dioxide.
*  Hence the term carbon pollution is outrageous.
*  We'll have more on Chris Wright's nomination later in the broadcast.
*  We'll speak with the president of the NRDC.
*  More details have emerged about a sexual assault allegation against Pete Hegseth, the
*  Fox News weekend host picked by Donald Trump to become defense secretary.
*  Hegseth has been accused of assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2017 after he addressed
*  the California Federation of Republican Women.
*  Hegseth's lawyer has claimed the encounter was consensual, but The Washington Post reports
*  woman an undisclosed amount after she signed a non-disclosure agreement.
*  In other transition news, Trump has picked Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan
*  Carr to chair the agency.
*  Carr wrote the Project 2025 chapter on the FCC for the Heritage Foundation.
*  He's a critic of big tech who is expected to roll back many Biden-era policies, including
*  net neutrality protections.
*  He's served on the FCC since 2017.
*  In the Philippines, a landslide caused by super typhoon Manyi killed at least seven
*  people and destroyed dozens of houses in Nueva Vizcaya province as the northern Philippines
*  suffered its sixth major storm in under a month.
*  The floodwater from the typhoon in the surrounding provinces gushed here because the elevation
*  of the land here is lower.
*  It makes our lives difficult.
*  It's hard for us, especially for those of us without sufficient food.
*  It's dreadful.
*  Southeast Asia is one of the world's most vulnerable regions to the worsening climate
*  crisis as rising ocean temperatures lead to more frequent and destructive storms.
*  The U.N. climate summit here in Baku, Azerbaijan, has entered its second and final week.
*  On Saturday, activists held a silent protest to demand the phase out of fossil fuels, climate
*  financing for the global south and a just transition to clean energy.
*  Earlier today, activists called for an end to Israel's war on Gaza.
*  This is Mohammed Kamal from the Egyptian group Greenish.
*  When we're calling for an energy embargo, we're calling it because it's the primary
*  source that is fueling this genocide.
*  We need action and not commitment.
*  Words are empty.
*  We need this action to be in front of us.
*  People in the region have been speaking out, but governments are not matching that action
*  at all.
*  So we need to see these commitments happening.
*  We need an energy embargo.
*  President Biden and other world leaders are gathering in Brazil for the G20 summit.
*  Ahead of the meeting, Biden became the first sitting U.S. president to visit the Amazon
*  rainforest.
*  On Saturday, indigenous protesters in Rio de Janeiro took giant cutouts of Biden and
*  other world leaders and sank them in the water to demand more action on the climate crisis.
*  This is Cleber Carapuna of the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil.
*  In anticipation of the meeting of the big global leaders of the G20, we are sinking
*  these heads to represent how these leaders, who had some of the biggest economies in the
*  world, are failing to face climate change.
*  In a separate protest, activists in Brazil placed 733 plates on Copacabana Beach to represent
*  the 733 million people suffering from hunger in the world.
*  Antonio Carlos Costa is a founder of the group Rio de Paz.
*  We placed 733 empty plates on the sand of Copacabana Beach, symbolizing the 733 million
*  human beings who went hungry last year, according to data provided by the United Nations.
*  The aim of this public act is to demand that the public authorities attending G20 here
*  in Río de Janeiro make a swift commitment to eradicating hunger.
*  Palestinian rights protesters also marched in Rio on Saturday to call for an immediate
*  ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon ahead of the G20 summit.
*  A Guatemalan appeals court has overturned the order that released journalist José de
*  Ben Zamora from prison to house arrest last month and ordered him to return to jail.
*  The National Press Club blasted the decision in what they called the quote, baseless and
*  vindictive case brought by the Guatemalan government, unquote.
*  Zamora is the founder of El Periodico, which was shut down by the previous president, Alejandro
*  Diamante.
*  In Las Vegas, a man was shot dead by a police officer in his own home after he called 911
*  to report a break-in.
*  Brandon Durham, a 43-year-old black father and realtor, was with his 15-year-old daughter
*  at the time, who survived the shooting.
*  Durham's partner spoke out against the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police following the deadly
*  shooting, saying, quote, What are you looking at?
*  Not the colors of the clothes.
*  You're looking at the color of the skin, and that's why he's dead, unquote.
*  The U.S. Justice Department has launched a civil rights investigation into the killing
*  of Sonia Massey in her kitchen by a sheriff's deputy in July.
*  Massey, a 36-year-old black woman, had called 911 for help after suspecting a possible intruder
*  was outside her home.
*  The Sangamon County deputy, Sean Grayson, who's white, has been charged with first-degree
*  murder.
*  And the family of Malcolm X has filed a $100 million federal lawsuit against the New York
*  Police Department, CIA and FBI, claiming the agencies engaged in a, quote, fraudulent
*  concealment and cover-up, unquote, of Malcolm X's assassination in 1965.
*  Civil rights attorney Ben Crump is representing the family.
*  The government fingerprints are all over the assassination of Malcolm X.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  We're broadcasting live from the United Nations Climate Summit in Baku, Azerbaijan,
*  which has entered its second and final week.
