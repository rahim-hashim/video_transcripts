A new study projects as many as 20 million people could lose Medicaid coverage under a Republican congressional bill to cut the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion match rate. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found the bill includes tax cuts for the wealthy and businesses, paired with cuts on the programs that support low-income Americans. "There is a direct link between their desire to extend very expensive tax cuts for very wealthy people and the cuts they are putting on the table that will take health coverage and food assistance away from people that struggle to afford the basics," says Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

# GOP Pushes Drastic Cuts to Medicaid & Food Aid While Proposing Tax Cuts for Rich
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=10.28s)]
*  In health news, a new study is projecting as many as 20 million people could lose Medicaid [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=12.44s)]
*  coverage under a Republican congressional bill to cut the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=17.88s)]
*  expansion match rate. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Republicans are also pushing for work requirements for Medicaid recipients. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=24.6s)]
*  American hospital associations harshly criticized proposals to cut funding for Medicaid, saying, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=28.4s)]
*  "...Medicaid provides health care to many of our most vulnerable populations, including [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=33.76s)]
*  pregnant women, children, the elderly, disabled and many of our working class." [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=39.0s)]
*  We're joined now by Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=43.16s)]
*  She formerly worked at the Department of Health and Human Services in OMB, the Office of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=49.32s)]
*  Management and Budget. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=53.12s)]
*  Sharon, if you can start off by talking about the significance of this congressional bill. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  I think what's missing in all these national discussions is the true effect on people and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=60.36s)]
*  how many people, what Medicaid, who it's for. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=66.96s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't agree more. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=71.32s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me this morning. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=74.0s)]
*  There are 72 million people in the United States that get health coverage through Medicaid, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=77.16s)]
*  and there are many proposals moving through Congress that would take coverage away from [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=83.36s)]
*  potentially millions of people, leaving them without coverage. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=88.96s)]
*  And I want to drill down for just a moment on what it means to be without health coverage. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=93.32s)]
*  When Medicaid is taken away, what does that mean? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=97.53999999999999s)]
*  It means a parent who can't get cancer treatment. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=101.24s)]
*  It means a young adult just starting out who can't get insulin to control their diabetes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=105.02s)]
*  It's absolutely essential for them to be able to work and move up the economic ladder. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=112.78s)]
*  It means older adults and people with disabilities losing the care they get in their homes so [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=117.97999999999999s)]
*  that they don't have to move into nursing homes and institutions. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=125.46s)]
*  It means workers who can't get access to mental health treatment. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=130.45999999999998s)]
*  Medicaid provides life-saving care and access to coverage that is both primary care and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=137.18s)]
*  acute care. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=143.1s)]
*  It helps people control chronic diseases, and it helps them thrive. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=144.66s)]
*  And so when you hear all the numbers and the hundreds of billions of dollars that are being [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=150.70000000000002s)]
*  proposed to be cut, the tens of millions of people that could lose coverage, it's important [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=155.66s)]
*  to remember what that means to an individual and to their family. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about what the impact, potential impact on Medicare as well, because [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=166.62s)]
*  Republicans are more and more interested in shifting more retired people into a Medicare [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=171.98000000000002s)]
*  Advantage rather than the regular Medicare system, which is in essence privatizing much [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=179.66000000000003s)]
*  of Medicare. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=185.98000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we've seen a real shift over the last several decades in people moving from traditional [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=187.46s)]
*  Medicare to Medicare Advantage, and there are real issues emerging with Medicare Advantage, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=193.68s)]
*  including that it is more costly for the federal government than traditional Medicare. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  And unfortunately, people often have health care access issues within Medicare Advantage. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=206.88s)]
*  But I think what we're going to see this year is a more targeted approach, really targeting [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=213.4s)]
*  cuts in Medicaid, which is our health care coverage system for people with low and moderate [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  incomes. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=226.84s)]
*  And as you said at the beginning, it is kids, it is adults, it is parents, it is workers, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=229.56s)]
*  it is seniors, and it is people with disabilities. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  Medicaid is an important linchpin in our health coverage system, covering, again, 72 million [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  people, including 20 million of whom are now getting coverage because of the Affordable [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=246.6s)]
*  Care Act's Medicaid expansion, very much in the crosshairs for some Republican members [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=253.64s)]
*  of Congress. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=260.88s)]
*  And most people don't realize that a lot of the spending cuts are basically as a result [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=263.6s)]
*  of the tax cuts initiated during the first Trump administration that are about to expire. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=268.18s)]
*  And so, Congress—and, of course, most of that went to the wealthiest Americans. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=276.28s)]
*  Could you talk about that, this expiration of these cuts? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=281.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=286.04s)]
*  So, in 2017, massive tax cuts were enacted. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=287.04s)]
*  Those tax cuts were very expensive, and they were highly skewed towards wealthy people [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=292.56s)]
*  and profitable corporations. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=298.4s)]
*  Many of those tax cuts, particularly the tax cuts that relate to individual people and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=302.32s)]
*  some business tax cuts, are due to expire at the end of this year. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=306.48s)]
*  And Republicans in Congress are trying to put forward a budget plan that overall would [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=311.48s)]
*  not only extend those tax cuts but make them larger. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=317.32s)]
*  And to offset some of the costs, they're pointing to making massive cuts in things [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=321.96s)]
*  like health coverage and food assistance for some of the lowest-income households in the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=328.16s)]
*  country. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=333.8s)]
*  The cuts they are proposing in Medicaid and food assistance equals the cuts—the tax [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=335.22s)]
*  cuts that they want to make or extend for the people in the top 1 percent of income. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=342.8s)]
*  So there is a direct link between their desire to extend very expensive tax cuts for very [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  wealthy people and the cuts they are putting on the table that will take health coverage [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=358.28s)]
*  and food assistance away from people that struggle to afford the basics. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=363.52s)]
*  Just to give you a little bit of a sense of how discordant this is, households in the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=369.52s)]
*  top 1 percent of the income distribution have incomes of more than $740,000. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=376.36s)]
*  The tax cut alone for those folks would average $62,000, which is more than the entire income [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=384.56s)]
*  of most people that benefit from Medicaid and from food assistance through the SNAP [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=394.24s)]
*  program. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=400.08s)]
*  That is how imbalanced this agenda is. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=401.08s)]
*  Sharon, last Thursday, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon warned on his podcast War Room [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=404.28s)]
*  that Medicaid is a complicated program to cut. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=410.6s)]
*  This is what he said. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=413.88s)]
*  Get into that discretionary spending. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=414.88s)]
*  Get into the Pentagon. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=417.24s)]
*  Get into Medicaid. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=418.24s)]
*  Medicaid, you've got to be careful, because a lot of MAGA is on Medicaid. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=419.24s)]
*  I'm telling you, if you don't think so, you are dead wrong. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=423.24s)]
*  Medicaid is going to be a complicated one. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=428.24s)]
*  Just can't take a Medex to it, although I would love to. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=430.15999999999997s)]
*  So one of the points he made is that many MAGA supporters, many Trump supporters, are [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=433.44s)]
*  on Medicaid. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=439.64s)]
*  He also called Elon Musk a parasitic, illegal immigrant. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=441.86s)]
*  But the significance of what he said in this last minute, Sharon Parrott, what he's [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=446.34000000000003s)]
*  representing within the Republican Party, as I speak to lobbyists who are pushing for [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=452.98s)]
*  Medicaid, talking to Republican congressmembers and their staff, these congressmembers' staff [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=457.62s)]
*  understand well they're in trouble on this. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=463.3s)]
*  Look, Medicaid provides health coverage, life-saving health coverage, to 72 million Americans. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=467.82s)]
*  That is more than one in four people in the United States. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=473.78000000000003s)]
*  People in every state, people in every community, people of all ages, people of all races and [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=478.26s)]
*  ethnicities get health coverage through Medicaid. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=484.84000000000003s)]
*  And so what I think Mr. Bannon was referring to is that millions of people will be adversely [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=489.16s)]
*  affected by cuts that take coverage away from people. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=497.64000000000004s)]
*  Those are the people that are directly impacted, that have coverage, that will lose it and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=501.64000000000004s)]
*  their access to health care. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=506.92s)]
*  And it is also their family members who, when their family members lose Medicaid, extended [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=508.72s)]
*  have to try to scrimp and save and bring together resources that they don't have when someone [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=516.04s)]
*  has a life-threatening health condition or a chronic condition. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=523.42s)]
*  And so the ripple effects of Medicaid are vast. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=528.26s)]
*  It is an essential part of our health coverage system. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=532.06s)]
*  And policymakers should not want to take health coverage away from people for whom the cost [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=535.74s)]
*  of health care and food is far more important to them than the performance of the Dow Jones [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=542.6600000000001s)]
*  Industrial Average. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=548.22s)]
*  And, Parrott, I want to thank you for being with us. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=549.22s)]
*  President's Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, I'm sure we're going to be calling on you [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAjAAWIvKI&t=552.0200000000001s)]
