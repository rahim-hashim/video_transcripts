In his last public appearance before he died, Pope Francis addressed Easter Sunday Mass and repeated his call for a ceasefire in Gaza. “Pope Francis’s position on Palestine is just an extension of his theology and pastoral care in general, caring for the marginalized and victims of injustice,” says Reverend Munther Isaac, a Palestinian Christian theologian and pastor from Bethlehem.

# "Heart of Compassion" for Palestine: Pope Francis Called for Gaza Ceasefire Until His Final Days
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok)
*  I wanted to go to Reverend Muntar Isaac, Palestinian Christian theologian pastor at the Evangelical [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=0.0s)]
*  Lutheran Christmas Church in Bethlehem. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=6.7s)]
*  Last Christmas, he delivered a sermon titled Christ is Still in the Rubble. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=10.26s)]
*  His forthcoming book is titled Christ in the Rubble, Faith, the Bible and the Genocide [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=14.36s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=19.26s)]
*  If you can talk about the pope's stand as late as yesterday, hours before his death, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=20.86s)]
*  he called for a ceasefire in Gaza, and of course, in the last year, has gone way beyond [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=28.62s)]
*  that, Reverend Muntar Isaac. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=34.3s)]
*  Yes, this is, of course, a great loss to all humanity, and particularly to the Christian [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=36.980000000000004s)]
*  world, to the Catholic world, and we really lament and grieve his loss. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  And I think that Pope Francis' position on Palestine is just an extension of his theology [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=50.24s)]
*  and pastoral care in general, caring for the marginalized and victims of injustice. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=56.82s)]
*  What he has done and exhibited and said throughout the war on Gaza was not the first time he [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=64.02s)]
*  spoke for the plight of Palestinians. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=68.92s)]
*  I think no Palestinian will ever forget when Pope Francis in 2014 stopped his car, went [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=71.9s)]
*  down, stepped down and prayed at the separation wall separating Jerusalem from Bethlehem, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=80.9s)]
*  a moment that touched all of us and continued to speak to us for four years. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=86.74000000000001s)]
*  And during the war on Gaza, I think he reflected two very important elements. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  First, his pastoral heart, his compassion. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=96.94s)]
*  He spoke almost on a daily basis to the Church of the Holy Family in Gaza. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=99.98s)]
*  He genuinely cared. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  He often even joked with them. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=108.06s)]
*  He would pray with them, which reflect his heart of compassion. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=109.84s)]
*  But I think his words also went beyond the standard, pray for peace kind of language [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=115.12s)]
*  of many church leaders. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=122.08s)]
*  And this is the distinction of Pope Francis, his courage, his always seeking to push things [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  forward. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=129.88s)]
*  He spoke, as we heard, on the war as terror, as cruelty. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=131.32s)]
*  And I think one of the most important things he has said was in a book in which he called [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=136.32s)]
*  for investigation as to what Israel has committed in Gaza amounts to a genocide. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=141.68s)]
*  To me, this is extremely important because it calls for accountability and it shows that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  he's more than just compassion and peace. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=154.84s)]
*  He's for justice, he's for accountability. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=157.64s)]
*  And I think this is really what's missing from the language of many faith leaders. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=161.52s)]
*  He was exemplary in that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=166.4s)]
*  Now, you are not a Catholic, but talk about his effect on Christians throughout the West [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=169.4s)]
*  Bank and Gaza, on Muslims as well, as he pushed for more understanding of the Islamic faith, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=180.68s)]
*  as he talked about migrants, and making this a centerpiece of what he said. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  It's very interesting, as he called for a ceasefire in Gaza yesterday, the same day [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=196.0s)]
*  that he met with the vice president of the United States for a number of seconds. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=206.0s)]
*  It's important, then, to note that here is Lutheran pastor speaking about Pope Francis [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=207.6s)]
*  as a leader for all of us, because he truly and genuinely reflected, in my opinion, the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=217.24s)]
*  ideals of the gospel. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=222.16s)]
*  He was a true follower of Jesus and he exemplified, not just in words, but in actions, the teachings [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  of Jesus. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  And as I said, he was truly beloved for us in Palestine because he made us feel recognized [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  in a time when many tried to ignore and dehumanize Palestinians. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=240.68s)]
*  The way he spoke about Arabs, Muslims in general, even when there was attacks on the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=246.6s)]
*  Christian community by some Islamic groups, he would make sure that we distinguish between, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=255.24s)]
*  for example, what Islam says and what these fringe or radical groups do, warning from [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=261.92s)]
*  the dangers of Islamophobia. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=268.52s)]
*  So he truly understood the danger of the polemic language that exists in many of our politicians [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=272.24s)]
*  today and tried to be a bridge builder and fight stereotypes, recognizing that extremism [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=279.16s)]
*  exists in all faith traditions. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  And for all of that, as I said, he is truly beloved by many who are in the fringe marginalized [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=290.48s)]
*  and including here as well in Palestine. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=300.54s)]
*  And I think you mentioning his meeting with Vice President Vance, I think it's important [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=303.22s)]
*  because in the coming days, and I'm sure we will hear so many good things said from politicians [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=309.58000000000004s)]
*  about Pope Francis, the very same politicians who would go on and ignore everything he taught [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=315.3s)]
*  and said, which is never new. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=319.88s)]
*  We've seen the same happen with people like Desmond Tutu and others, for example, on the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  apartheid in Palestine and so on. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=328.78s)]
*  So it's going to be interesting to hear, to see hypocrisy manifested from the mouth [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=331.3s)]
*  of many politicians who will say all good things about Pope Francis, then go on contradicting [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=336.98s)]
*  many of the things he taught and sought to establish throughout his ministry, whether [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=343.34s)]
*  as a priest, as a bishop, Archbishop Cardinal, and of course, as Pope. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=349.38s)]
*  I want to go right now to the pope talking about the cardinal, and then you can explain [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=354.38s)]
*  what happened. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=363.7s)]
*  Cardinal Rey spoke about the war. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=369.65999999999997s)]
*  Yesterday they did not let the patriarch enter into Gaza, as they had promised. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=372.1s)]
*  And yesterday, children were bombed. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=377.54s)]
*  This is cruelty. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=380.62s)]
*  This is not war. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=382.34s)]
*  I wanted to say this because it touches the heart. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=384.46s)]
*  Can you explain, Reverend Muthar Isaac, in Bethlehem, what took place last December? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=387.7s)]
*  I think the pope was talking about the incident in which two Palestinian Christian women were [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=396.06s)]
*  shot and killed within the vicinity of the Church of the Holy Family in Gaza. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=401.65999999999997s)]
*  He said, this is the church, there are no militants there. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=409.1s)]
*  He clearly was in touch with the people in the church who assured him that no one was [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=412.78000000000003s)]
*  in the church campus other than the Christian families who escaped. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=418.38s)]
*  He spoke with clarity, condemning what happened and saying this is cruelty, this is terror, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=423.58000000000004s)]
*  when two innocent women are killed by snipers literally in front of the door of the church [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=431.86s)]
*  for no reason whatsoever. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=438.46s)]
*  It shows that he recognized that this is not just, as Israel always claimed, they're targeting [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=441.21999999999997s)]
*  militants or that militants hide behind civilians and so on. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=448.58s)]
*  None of that happened when the churches were attacked. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=452.5s)]
*  And I think what happened at the churches points to the reality all of Gaza says, that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=456.29999999999995s)]
*  innocent civilians are targeted under the cover or under the justification that militants [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=461.42s)]
*  are hiding there, whereas in the church clearly no militants were there. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=468.90000000000003s)]
*  And the words that the pope chose I think were extremely important, whether cruelty, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=474.3s)]
*  whether terror, I think all of these describe the hell that exists right now in Gaza. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=478.90000000000003s)]
*  And I really wish more faith leaders speak with this moral clarity describing what is [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=485.18s)]
*  happening right now in Gaza, rather than simply wishing for a ceasefire without calling things [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=492.62s)]
*  by name. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=499.02s)]
*  Rev. Muthar Isaac, we want to thank you for joining us from Bethlehem. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=500.02s)]
*  Rev. Isaac tweeted today, I wonder, will the millions who will mourn his death these coming [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=504.18s)]
*  days respect this wish of his? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=510.34000000000003s)]
*  Will they care for Gazans and Palestinians the way he did? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWHgnFk9ok&t=512.5s)]
