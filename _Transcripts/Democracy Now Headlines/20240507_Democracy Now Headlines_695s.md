*  I'm Amy Goodman with Juan González.
*  We look now at how Gaza Solidarity encampments are continuing at college campuses across
*  the U.S. despite brutal police crackdowns.
*  In the latest roundup, at least 43 students were arrested Monday at UCLA.
*  The Intercept reports, after New York police raided Columbia University encampment last
*  week, some of the arrested students were denied water and food for about 16 hours.
*  Two protesters were held in solitary confinement.
*  On Monday, Columbia canceled its main university-wide graduation ceremony May 15th amidst mounting
*  fallout from its mishandling of the peaceful protests.
*  Meanwhile, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner visited the University of Pennsylvania,
*  Gaza Solidarity encampment last week to speak with organizers and legal observers.
*  The First Amendment comes from here.
*  This is Philadelphia.
*  We don't have to do stupid like they did in Columbia.
*  We don't have to do stupid.
*  What we should be doing here is upholding our tradition of being a welcoming, inviting
*  city where people say things, even if other people don't like them, because they have
*  a right to say it in the United States, and where protesters also have an obligation to
*  remain nonviolent and to engage in speech activity and in activity that does not become
*  illegal.
*  That's Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner at the encampment at UPenn.
*  This comes as more than 50 chapters of the American Association of University Professors,
*  the AAUP, have issued a statement condemning the violent arrests by police at campus protests.
*  This includes our next guest, Dartmouth professor, former Chair of Jewish Studies Annalise Orleck,
*  who says police body-slammed her to the ground as she tried to protect her students when
*  officers in riot gear cleared the peaceful encampment on Dartmouth's campus.
*  Annalise Orleck is a professor of history, women's gender and sexuality studies, former
*  Chair of Jewish Studies at Dartmouth College, where she's taught for more than 30 years.
*  Professor Orleck was among dozens of students, faculty and community members arrested at
*  the Dartmouth encampment last week.
*  She's been charged with criminal trespass and temporarily banned from portions of Dartmouth's
*  campus.
*  She's joining us now from Thetford, Vermont.
*  Professor Orleck, thanks so much for being with us.
*  Can you take us through what happened that day?
*  Where were you?
*  Why did you decide to go to this encampment?
*  And then what happened?
*  We were concerned that the students might be subject to some kind of violence, to—I
*  didn't really think there was going to be arrest, but I didn't know for sure.
*  The institution had sent out a very strict list of do's and don'ts earlier in the
*  day, and it was clear that they were going to try to break up the encampment as quickly
*  as possible.
*  So there were a whole bunch of us, there were dozens of faculty out there to try to support
*  them, and I was in a line of mostly older women, most of us Jewish, and the riot police
*  came at us and started trying to literally physically push people off the green.
*  We were standing in front of our students, between the students and the riot police,
*  in the hope of preventing violence.
*  That didn't happen.
*  My students and I were subject to really violent handling in the course of our arrest, and
*  it's possible that I was subject to the most violent handling.
*  What happened to you?
*  I was videoing my students' arrests.
*  I was telling the police, they're just students, they're not criminals, leave them alone.
*  And suddenly I was body slammed from behind by these very large men in body armor, and
*  hard enough that my feet left the ground for a few seconds.
*  I landed on the ground in front of the protesters.
*  They had taken my phone, and so I got up to try to demand my phone, and then they grabbed
*  me under the arms, slammed me to the ground, dragged me face down on the grass.
*  One guy had his knee on me, and honestly, Amy, I heard myself saying what I'd seen in
*  videos so many times, you're hurting me, I can't breathe, stop.
*  And they said to me what they've said to so many, victims of police brutality, you're
*  talking, you can breathe.
*  They then put on the zip tie cuffs on me, on a colleague, my colleague Christopher McEvitt,
*  and on many of our students so tightly that people have nerve damage, compressed nerves,
*  severe pain.
*  So that's what happened to us that night.
*  The university has not dropped charges for criminal trespass or even asked the DA to
*  drop the charges.
*  So we are all banned from the green, which is the center of campus, from the administration
*  building where we would go to protest, and from the street on which the president's house
*  stands.
*  And Professor Orlik, the faculty met with the Dartmouth president yesterday, Monday.
*  Could you talk about what was discussed and what was the message of the faculty to the
*  administration?
*  The message of the faculty was drop all the charges now, apologize for the harm and trauma
*  you've inflicted on the campus, promise that there will be no riot police call to campus
*  again, change your policies on protest to be less restrictive and to acknowledge constitutional
*  on free speech and get rid of the Palestine exception to free speech.
*  People have to be able to talk about Palestine without being attacked by police with clubs,
*  gas and God knows what else.
*  I want to ask you, Professor Orlik, you're a professor of history, of women's gender
*  and sexuality studies, former chair of Jewish studies.
*  President Biden is going to be giving an address on anti-Semitism today, issuing what they
*  say is a clarion call to fight swiftly rising tide of anti-Semitism across the United States,
*  and especially on college campuses.
*  I put this question to the Israeli peace negotiator, Daniel Levi, as well.
*  But if you can talk about whether you see this rise and also the equating of anti-Zionism
*  with anti-Semitism and the number of Jewish professors and students who are part of these
*  protests.
*  Yes, I think this protest movement has a large and disproportionate percentage of Jewish
*  students and faculty involved because we all feel very strongly that we don't want this
*  genocide in Gaza in our name.
*  And I was really struck by the fact that there was some reporting, I think, by the Guardian
*  and BBC that I heard today that people stirring up a lot of trouble and saying things outside
*  the gates of Columbia were tied to the Proud Boys, that there were people who attacked
*  the protesters at UCLA so violently and who had ties to Trump rallies.
*  And I think it's deeply ironic, deeply, deeply ironic that the House Republicans who supported
*  the January 6th assault on the Capitol, in which people were wearing Camp Auschwitz shirts
*  and shirts with a logo that says 6MWE, 6 million wasn't enough, and that they have become the
*  defenders against anti-Semitism.
*  I heard nothing.
*  There were Buddhist, Christian, Muslim and Jewish chaplains at our protest.
*  The students were singing.
*  They were chanting.
*  Yes, there was some of the River to the Sea chant that many Jews find so offensive and
*  believe is a call to genocide.
*  I accept the interpretation made by my Palestinian colleagues and students that this chant is
*  about equality from the River to the Sea and freedom.
*  So I don't see any anti-Semitism.
*  And you should know that the Jewish, many Jewish faculty at Dartmouth signed a letter
*  insisting that the president not speak in our name and not use anti-Semitism to rationalize
*  bringing these violent forces onto our campus.
*  And Professor, your message to the students who've led and organized these peaceful protests
*  for months despite all of this repression?
*  Well, my students are, our students are holding another rally today on one of the parts of
*  the campus we're not banned from, which is the grass in front of the library.
*  And I think their bravery is tremendous and it's inspiring.
*  And they really feel like this is the moral issue of their time, that there's a genocide
*  going on and that they can't ignore it.
*  And again, I have colleagues at Columbia, colleagues at UCLA and in many parts of the
*  country who have been part of the, not part of the encampments, but have visited the encampments,
*  have spoken to the students there, have not felt threatened, have not felt anti-Semitism.
*  Certainly at Dartmouth we didn't.
*  And there's a very powerful open letter from a Christian pastor who was there who's
*  saying the same thing.
*  So stop weaponizing anti-Semitism.
*  It's offensive and it's wrong.
*  Finally, Professor Ehrlich, how are you right now, having been beaten to the ground?
*  And also, you're banned from your campus where you've taught for over 30 years parts
*  of it?
*  Yes, I was initially, as a condition of my bail, banned from the entire campus.
*  But the college insisted that was a clerical error and gave light of their argument that
*  they can't get charges changed or dropped by calling the local police department and
*  getting them to change my bail so that I can teach.
*  So I can now teach, but my building is on one of the streets that I'm banned from.
*  So I was having to run up the street yesterday in sunglasses really quickly, trying to get
*  to my class and not get arrested.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  And the green is the very center of our campus.
*  We all cross it many times a day.
*  My kids grew up playing on the green.
*  The idea that we can't have access to the beating heart of our campus is offensive again.
*  And it just gives a sense.
*  The president makes this argument that she's trying to ensure that the green is open to
*  people with all views and that the five tenths and ten students who were camped out there
*  would make the green a place that only people of one view could be.
*  Honestly, I think that's what they did by making us frightened.
*  I'm still hurting.
*  I have nerve damage in my wrist.
*  I have an injured shoulder.
*  I have bruising and swelling.
*  And it's very scary.
*  And I'm getting better.
*  But it's crazy that I should be in this position for trying to protect my students.
*  And I say the same for other faculty who are out there, including Chris McEvitt, my colleague
*  on the faculty, who was also arrested and also harmed.
*  Anneliese Oerloek, we want to thank you for being with us, professor of history, women's
*  gender and sexuality studies, former chair of Jewish studies at Dartmouth College, where
*  she's taught for more than 30 years, Professor Oerloek, among dozens of students, faculty,
*  community members arrested at a Dartmouth encampment.
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Juan González for another edition of Democracy Now!
