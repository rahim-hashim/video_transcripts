# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” August 13, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIqglM4YfAI)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, DemocracyNow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip continues, with at least 32 more Palestinians killed
*  in the past 24 hours, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
*  One overnight strike by Israel on a home in Chanyunas killed 10 Palestinians, wounded
*  several others.
*  Another Israeli attack leveled a residential building in Gaza City, burying residents in
*  their homes.
*  We heard the sound of an airstrike.
*  We came to see what had happened, and we found that the Israeli military had hit the building.
*  The building has civilians inside.
*  He's my cousin, him and his wife and his child.
*  Unfortunately, we found their bodies in pieces, and we're still looking for the child's
*  head.
*  On Monday, a spokesperson for Hamas's armed wing said one Israeli hostage was killed and
*  two other women captives seriously wounded in two separate incidents in Gaza.
*  Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council set to meet today in the wake of Saturday's
*  devastating Israeli airstrike on a school and mosque in Gaza City that killed over 100
*  Palestinians.
*  We'll have more on Israel's assault on Gaza and growing calls for a ceasefire later
*  in the broadcast.
*  Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gavir said Jews should be permitted
*  to pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque as he stormed the religious compound in occupied East Jerusalem
*  with up to 2,000 Israeli settlers earlier today.
*  Under the current status quo, non-Muslims are allowed to visit the holy site but are
*  not allowed to pray there.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces killed an 18-year-old Palestinian during overnight
*  raids elsewhere.
*  Israeli settlers raided the Palestinian village of Atwani in large numbers.
*  Amidst the mounting death toll and destruction, the U.S. State Department says it will resume
*  funding to the Israeli military's Netza Yehuda battalion after ending its probe into
*  the ultra-Orthodox group.
*  Despite acknowledging gross human rights violations against Palestinians, the U.S. State Department
*  said the unit had done enough to improve their standing in recent months and decided not
*  to impose sanctions.
*  Among other things, Netza Yehuda was involved in the gruesome murder of a 78-year-old Palestinian-American
*  citizen Omar Assad near Ramallah in 2022.
*  In Burma, there are reports hundreds of Rohingya Muslims were killed, including children, in
*  drone strikes last week in western Raqqin state.
*  The attacks last Monday targeted members of the Rohingya community as they attempted to
*  flee to Bangladesh via the Naf River.
*  Others drowned while they tried to cross the river.
*  Survivors and activists say the Arakan army was behind the assault, with the AA says the
*  military junta, which overthrew the elected government in 2021, is to blame.
*  A new report from Human Rights Watch finds both parties guilty of extrajudicial killings,
*  unlawful recruitment for combat and widespread arson against Rohingya, Raqqin and other civilians
*  in recent months.
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin's promised to retaliate after Ukraine's military seized
*  hundreds of square miles of Russian territory in a surprise offensive.
*  On Monday, Putin accused the U.S. and its allies of waging war against Russia using
*  Ukrainians and accused Ukraine's army of committing war crimes.
*  The governor of Russia's Kursk region said the offensive had so far killed 12 civilians
*  while displacing more than 120,000 others.
*  Some evacuees said they barely escaped with their lives.
*  There was shelling.
*  How do you call them?
*  Shells.
*  Shells were falling quite close, three meters from the house.
*  And we were standing in the hallway like this, and we're appealing to God.
*  Please don't let them hit the house.
*  We have children sleeping here.
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the offensive is aimed at forcing Russia to
*  negotiate for peace.
*  He added, quote, Russia brought war to others, and now it is coming home, unquote.
*  Zelensky's comments came after a meeting with a bipartisan delegation of U.S. senators
*  in Kiev.
*  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called Ukraine's surprise offensive bold, brilliant and beautiful,
*  while Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal urged President Biden to lift all restrictions
*  on Ukraine's use of U.S.-made weapons.
*  We want to convey to the administration a message that it should provide more flexibility
*  and authority to Ukraine in using the weapons that have been provided to strike deeper behind
*  the lines that exist right now.
*  There are limits and issues of permission.
*  We hope to cut through them.
*  The International Committee of the Red Cross is calling for nations to respect the Geneva
*  Conventions.
*  As the group marked the 75th anniversary of their signing Monday, the Geneva Conventions
*  established international legal standards for humanitarian treatment and protection
*  of civilians in war.
*  Mirjana Spolyaric, president of the ICRC, spoke Monday.
*  Where are the peacemakers?
*  As I look at the destruction in Gaza, the relentless conflict in Ukraine and the suffering
*  in Sudan and elsewhere, I think, where are the leaders championing negotiations?
*  Cease every chance to de-escalate.
*  The faithful application of international humanitarian law can bolster peace initiatives.
*  A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has sentenced a California man to 20 years in
*  prison for his role in the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.
*  Video shows David Nicholas Dempsey repeatedly struck Capitol police officers with a flagpole,
*  metal crutch and pepper spray as a mob of Trump supporters incited by the outgoing
*  president tried to push their way past police barricades to stop the certification of Joe
*  Biden's Electoral College victory.
*  It's the second longest sentence handed down so far against a January 6 rioter.
*  The FBI says it's investigating attempts by Iran to hack the campaigns of Kamala Harris
*  and Donald Trump.
*  The FBI's announcement came after a Trump campaign spokesperson claimed an Iranian cyber
*  attack was to blame for the release of internal documents to Politico and other news outlets,
*  including a so-called dirty laundry dossier on Trump's running mate, Jay DeVance.
*  On Monday evening, Trump returned to the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter,
*  for the first time since he was banned for inciting the January 6 Capitol insurrection.
*  The livestream, hosted by ex-CEO Elon Musk, was delayed by 40 minutes due to technical
*  malfunctions.
*  Trump's return to X came after he rallied thousands of supporters in Montana over the
*  weekend.
*  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECTIONAL MINISTER, JOSEPH BIDEN, AND THE FAMILY
*  If Comrade Walz and Comrade Harris win this November, the people cheering will be the
*  pink-haired Marxists, the looters, the perverts, the flag-burners, Hamas supporters, drug dealers,
*  gun grabbers and human traffickers.
*  AMY GOODMAN, HOST, THE CURTAIN, AND THE FAMILY
*  Trump left Montana aboard a private jet after his Boeing 757 experienced a mechanical problem.
*  The Trump campaign later confirmed press reports that the Gulfstream jet was once owned by
*  Jeffrey Epstein.
*  A spokesperson said the Trump campaign had no idea the plane used to belong to the serial
*  sexual predator.
*  Trump was a longtime high-profile friend of Epstein, who previously flew aboard his
*  private planes at least seven times.
*  In Greece, at least one person's dead, thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes as
*  firefighters battle wildfires around the capital, Athens.
*  Survivors recall fleeing their homes as the flames approached.
*  VLADIMIR VARADOV, CURTAIN, AND THE FAMILY
*  My house, it was utterly destroyed.
*  Even the walls fell down.
*  There's nothing left.
*  There's no morale, no courage.
*  There's no money anymore.
*  Everything was destroyed.
*  AMY GOODMAN, HOST, THE CURTAIN, AND THE FAMILY
*  The Greek fires have been fanned by strong winds and record high temperatures following
*  the hottest June and July ever recorded in Greece, which also logged its warmest winter
*  on record this year.
*  Yesterday was also the hottest day in Europe.
*  In Uganda, a massive landslide Friday at Kampala's Kintizi landfill has killed at
*  least 22 people.
*  The landslide, which buried people, livestock and homes, came after weeks of heavy downpours.
*  Rescue workers are continuing to search the area, as grieving family members await news
*  of their loved ones, including this man who lost two grandsons in the disaster.
*  VLADIMIR VARADOV, CURTAIN, AND THE FAMILY
*  The other day, they recovered a motorcycle belonging to one of my grandsons from there.
*  That is why we are convinced he is right there.
*  That is where he used to stay.
*  His neighbor was trying to get out his motorcycle when the mud started coming down.
*  He ran and left the motorcycle behind.
*  That is why he remembers that my grandson should be in this area.
*  His brother, too, was retrieved from the same place last evening.
*  AMY GOODMAN, HOST, THE CURTAIN, AND THE FAMILY
*  The Italian Coast Guard and the Spanish nonprofit Open Arms rescued 110 migrants at sea off the
*  Italian island of Lampedusa on Monday.
*  One refugee died during the journey.
*  This is rescue worker Esther Camps speaking after Monday's mission.
*  ESTHER CAMPBS, RESCUE WORKER, ESTER CAMPBS
*  Once again, these operations make evident that it's necessary to have more operations
*  and vessels that are willing to help these people.
*  AMY GOODMAN, HOST, THE CURTAIN, AND THE FAMILY
*  This comes as a contested Italian plan to transfer tens of thousands of refugees to
*  detention camps in Albania has been delayed.
*  Rights advocates have condemned the plan by far-right Italian Prime Minister Giorgia
*  Maloney, which they have compared to the now-defunct agreement between the U.K. and Rwanda.
*  And Randy Keeler, the anti-war activist whose speech inspired whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg
*  to release the Pentagon Papers, has died at the age of 80.
*  Randy Keeler was a self-proclaimed war tax resistor who refused to pay federal income
*  taxes beginning with the Vietnam War, during which he was jailed for draft resistance
*  for 22 months. He was also in jail for some three months in 1992 for refusing to pay some
*  federal income tax. In 1989, the IRS seized the house he shared with his wife, Betsy Corner.
*  Speaking to Democracy Now! on Tax Day in 1998, Randy Keeler said he and his family instead
*  paid the money they withheld from income taxes to victims of U.S. wars abroad and also to groups
*  serving hungry and unhoused people in their community in western Massachusetts.
*  Where we've drawn that line is in paying for nuclear weapons, weapons of mass destruction,
*  weapons of genocide. And also we've drawn the line at the creation of a massive so-called
*  conventional arsenal and its use in dominating and in invading and overpowering and destroying
*  people and nations around the world that oppose U.S. policies.
*  Peace activist Randy Keeler speaking to Democracy Now! in 1998. He's died at the age of 80.
*  And those are some of the headlines. This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org,
