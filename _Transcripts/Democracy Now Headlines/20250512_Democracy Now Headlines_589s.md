Jewish Voice for Peace held its largest-ever national member meeting in Baltimore from April 31 through May 4, with more than 2,000 attending. We feature the address of Democratic Congressmember Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, the only Palestinian American member of Congress, who addressed the conference as it began. “Why is it that our government always has enough money for bombs, to bomb people, to kill people, but never seems to have money to provide people with healthcare, with housing, enough food for their families?” Tlaib asked in her address.

*  This is a part of her remarks. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=177.0s)]
*  I was born and raised in the most beautiful, blackest city in the country, where every [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=179.0s)]
*  corner is a reminder of movement work. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=184.56s)]
*  I'm also a proud eldest daughter of 14—yes, Palestinians have lots of babies—and, of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=187.84s)]
*  Palestinian parents, my mother who grew up in the West Bank, and my father in a little [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=197.24s)]
*  village outside of Jerusalem. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=203.8s)]
*  But today I want to talk a little bit about addiction, our country's addiction to war, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  our country addicted to extraction to death. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  You know, the president of the United States currently has requested a trillion-dollar [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  military budget, the largest military budget in the history of our nation. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  But the Pentagon can't even pass an audit, y'all, seven audits in a row. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=235.24s)]
*  When folks in town halls in my community ask me, you know, well, talk about efficiency [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  and waste, I was like, they need to start with the Pentagon. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=244.76000000000002s)]
*  And people just screamed. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  And they said, absolutely. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=253.28s)]
*  You know, we already know, and I know all of you have heard Dr. King say that a nation [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=258.36s)]
*  that continues year after year, spending more money on military defense than on programs [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=263.04s)]
*  of social uplift is approaching spiritual death. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=268.0s)]
*  We've all heard that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=271.08s)]
*  You know, why is it that our government always has enough money for bombs and bombing people [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=272.68s)]
*  but never seems to have money to provide people with health care, with housing, enough food [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=280.08s)]
*  for their families? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=284.52s)]
*  I tell my colleagues all the time, I got schools in my community with garbage bags over their [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=289.36s)]
*  drinking fountain. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=295.64s)]
*  You know, I always remember hearing Shirley Chisholm talk about, the first black woman [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  ever elected to Congress talk about children can't learn if they're hungry, or children [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=302.6s)]
*  can't learn if they're being poisoned, not only by the water but the dirty air. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=306.88s)]
*  You know, people in our country every single day are dying because they can't afford health [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=312.68s)]
*  care. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=319.88s)]
*  That's why you hear people say, we don't have health care but we have sick care in our country. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=321.36s)]
*  More than 60,000 of our neighbors in our country die because they can't afford to see a doctor. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=324.64s)]
*  So I'm sick and tired of them saying we don't have money for resources here at home. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=331.08s)]
*  And it's a policy choice, we all know this. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=335.12s)]
*  But I say this because right now they are cutting Medicaid, which is a band-aid to sick [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=337.04s)]
*  care right now, and you know, leaving, coming here from the hill, watching them claim that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=342.24s)]
*  they're not doing it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  Gaslighting, it reminded me then of gaslighting the American people who were not supporting [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=348.68s)]
*  genocide. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=352.6s)]
*  We must continue to come together and choose our communities over wars and genocide. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=357.44s)]
*  And you know, and I don't know why it continues to be controversial to say we must stop bombing [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=366.12s)]
*  people. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=370.72s)]
*  I still remember in the early days of the genocide, we couldn't even say cease fire. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=375.76s)]
*  So to say I don't want our tax dollars used to dismember children or stop killing them, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=384.48s)]
*  that should not be controversial. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=392.48s)]
*  When I got elected in 2018 and sworn in 2019, I remember talking to my cousin who lives [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=397.48s)]
*  in Ramallah, and she told me, you know, it was this moment that we had, you know, I'm [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=406.48s)]
*  the older one, and she's, I always see her still like she's 11, 12, she's in her 30s, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=413.48s)]
*  has twin, twin boy and a girl, and she just very like quietly says, we thought they just [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=421.24s)]
*  wanted us all to die. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=428.88s)]
*  And I was like, who? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=430.24s)]
*  America. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=433.48s)]
*  Until you got elected. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=435.20000000000005s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=437.24s)]
*  She goes, Rashida, you don't understand. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=438.24s)]
*  We're like, well, they elected Rashida, they must not want us all to die. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=440.0s)]
*  No, it's so sad though, because she said it was Shusainite in Arabic to me. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=443.68s)]
*  And I said, no. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=449.16s)]
*  I said, you should come meet JVP Detroit. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=451.88000000000005s)]
*  I told her, cuz, oh my God, you gotta meet, because before I met all of y'all, rest of [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=464.44000000000005s)]
*  the JVP family, I had JVP Detroit. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=469.6s)]
*  Now, JVP Detroit, Jewish Voice for Peace in Detroit, you don't understand. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=472.08000000000004s)]
*  It was before the genocide, they were in a line trying to prevent shutoffs of water. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=476.36s)]
*  They were on the line saying, we're not gonna allow you to build stadium while taking money [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=480.82s)]
*  from school. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=484.36s)]
*  So they've been on the front line to speak truth to power consistently. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=485.36s)]
*  I mean, they experienced doxing before doxing was even a thing. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=490.36s)]
*  And I tell her, you don't understand, you have to come and see this incredible community [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=497.08000000000004s)]
*  in Detroit that says save lives. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=501.52000000000004s)]
*  Palestinians deserve to live, Palestinian children deserve to grow old. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=505.04s)]
*  I wish, Shereen, you could see it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=508.48s)]
*  But they don't get to always see it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=510.76000000000005s)]
*  You know, I know that many of you understand our shared humanity, that's why you're here, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=515.04s)]
*  that's why you're part of this movement. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=519.36s)]
*  But especially in the face of dehumanizing, you know, violence and the despair, we know [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=521.9200000000001s)]
*  that every life is sacred, no matter somebody's ethnic background or faith. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=527.64s)]
*  And we must work together for freedom and safety for all. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=532.56s)]
*  And real, true, peaceful coexistence for every faith. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=536.0s)]
*  I still remember my CD telling me the story of picking olives next to his Jewish neighbor. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=540.4399999999999s)]
*  That's what I want. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=546.2399999999999s)]
*  I don't want somebody being othered or seen as less than solely because they were born [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=547.56s)]
*  Palestinian. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=552.76s)]
*  So I'm grateful for all of your voices in this movement. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=554.4399999999999s)]
*  We know that many people around the world are with us, committed to ending the genocide [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  in Gaza, apartheid in all parts of occupied Palestine, and recognizing humanity in every [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=562.36s)]
*  person. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=568.6s)]
*  That's Democratic Congressmember Rashida Tlaib of Michigan addressing the Jewish Voice [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=569.6s)]
*  for Peace National meeting in Baltimore. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkMfiTtjXU&t=575.36s)]
