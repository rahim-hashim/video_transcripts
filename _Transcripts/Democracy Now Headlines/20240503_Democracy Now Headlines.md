*  Adnan al-Bursh, a surgeon, the head of orthopedics at Al-Shifa Hospital, was detained by Israel

*  President Biden addressed the protest Thursday.
*  President Biden said,
*  Dissent is essential to democracy, but dissent must never lead to disorder or to denying
*  the rights of others so students can finish their semester and their college education.
*  Look, it's basically a matter of fairness.
*  It's a matter of what's right.

*  The Pentagon has acknowledged that a U.S. drone strike in Syria, which was initially
*  reported to have successfully targeted an al-Qaeda senior leader, in fact killed a farmer.

*  After the attack, Mastah's family and neighbors said he had no connections to al-Qaeda or
*  any other armed groups.
*  Russian armed forces may have executed Ukrainian soldiers who attempted to surrender or had

*  Deception, in which companies launched a widespread greenwashing campaign as they carried
*  out business as usual.
*  This is Senate Budget Committee Chair Sheldon Whitehouse.
*  Phase four, put simply, is climate denial light, a green-leaning cover for the industry's
*  continued covert operation through dark money, phony front groups, false economics and relentless
*  exertion of political influence to block meaningful climate safety progress.
*  A federal court of appeals has sided with the Justice Department and dismissed Julianna
*  v. United States, the historic youth climate lawsuit against the U.S. government.
*  The decision was made by a panel of three Trump-appointed judges from the Ninth Circuit.
*  The group who brought the case, Our Children's Trust, is calling on the full court to reconsider
*  the ruling and on the American public to contact the Biden administration to demand it stop
*  persecuting climate activism.
*  Kelsey Juliana, the name plaintiff in the case, spoke to Democracy Now! in 2019.
*  So we're looking at the ways that the federal government has very knowingly and willfully
*  funded this climate crisis and the way that they are continuing to stall and delay our
*  climate case shows you exactly their priorities.
*  of their own self-interest and continuing this greedy fossil fuel economy rather than
*  ensuring the constitutional rights of life, liberty and property to all citizens, especially
*  young.

*  a second-majority black district.
*  The map was drawn up after another federal judge ruled a previous voting map, which
*  had just one black-majority district violated the Voting Rights Act.
*  Roughly one-third of Louisiana's population is black.
*  It remains unclear which map Louisiana will be using in November, as the case is expected
*  to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.
*  In other election news, New York Democratic state senator Timothy Kennedy easily won a
*  special election Tuesday for the New York congressional seat vacated in February by
*  Brian Higgins, another Democrat.
*  House Republicans hold 217 seats, while Democrats have 213 seats with five current vacancies.
*  In New York, prosecutors told a judge at the Manhattan criminal court they will retry Harvey
*  Weinstein after the New York Court of Appeals overturned his 2020 rape conviction last week.
