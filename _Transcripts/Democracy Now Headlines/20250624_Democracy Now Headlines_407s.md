Tuesday’s New York City mayoral primary could determine the future of the most populous city in the United States. We speak to John Tarleton, editor-in-chief of the The Indypendent, about the race, which pits the young, progressive socialist Zohran Mamdani against Andrew Cuomo, an establishment Democrat and the former state governor who resigned in 2020 amid an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment. Tarleton discusses Mamdani’s unique grassroots campaign, the influence of the powerful real-estate industry and why everything may come down to New York City’s ranked-choice voting system.

# How Ranked-Choice Voting May Decide NYC’s Mayoral Election: John Tarleton on Cuomo vs. Progressives
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=3.52s)]
*  To talk more about the New York mayoral race, we're joined by John Tarleton, editor-in-chief [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=5.28s)]
*  of The Independent, which is closely following New York City's mayoral election. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=10.56s)]
*  They had Zoran Mamdani on the cover of their January issue. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=15.84s)]
*  John's recent piece is headlined Zoran Mamdani's Path to Victory. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=19.52s)]
*  Earlier this month, Mamdani and Brad Lander, the other leading progressive candidate in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=24.96s)]
*  the race, announced they would cross-endorse each other using rank choice voting. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=30.6s)]
*  We both know what we need to do to save our city from Andrew Cuomo. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  Do you want to tell him? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=40.44s)]
*  You go first. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=41.56s)]
*  Yeah, you go first. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=42.56s)]
*  Let's do it together. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=43.56s)]
*  We're cross-endorsing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=44.56s)]
*  In New York City, we have rank choice voting. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=45.56s)]
*  That means you can rank up to five candidates for mayor. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Brad and I are officially telling our supporters. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  I'm your number one. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=52.36s)]
*  I'm your number one. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=53.36s)]
*  I'm your number two. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=54.8s)]
*  Let's send Andrew Cuomo back to the suburbs. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=55.8s)]
*  Now, this may be extremely strange for people who don't have rank choice voting to have [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=57.8s)]
*  two adversaries endorsing each other. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  For more, we're joined by John Tarleton to lay it all out, again, the editor-in-chief [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  of The Independent. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=70.4s)]
*  You just heard, before we talk about rank choice voting and the significance of these [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=72.64s)]
*  two co-endorsing each other, what that means. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=76.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=79.64s)]
*  Tom Donnie, it sort of reminds you, years ago, of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=80.92s)]
*  mainstream media hardly covered when she was running against Joe Crowley, longtime Democratic [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=89.76s)]
*  Congress member in the leadership of the House of Representatives. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=96.88s)]
*  And she beat him. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=101.28s)]
*  The Independent, your newspaper, had her on the cover before she even won. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=102.28s)]
*  Do you see a replay here? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=107.68s)]
*  I do see a lot of similarities. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=110.44000000000001s)]
*  You have a politician from an older generation, like Andrew Cuomo, that I think has really [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=112.68s)]
*  underestimated Zoran Mamdani and his campaign. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=119.48s)]
*  Cuomo is comfortable with a very stale, maybe outdated form of politicking. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=123.2s)]
*  There's been almost no grassroots ground game from the Cuomo campaign. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=130.72s)]
*  They thought they were going to win easily, so why go around knocking on doors? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=134.66s)]
*  Zoran Mamdani's campaign has now knocked on more than 1.5 million doors and had countless [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=139.0s)]
*  conversations with ordinary voters. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=144.36s)]
*  And also, Zoran Mamdani's platform is really, I think, speaking to a lot of people who feel [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=147.8s)]
*  like government doesn't do nearly enough to make their lives easier. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=154.56s)]
*  And that was something that AOC was doing seven years ago as well. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  I think one difference is, AOC was running in one congressional district that tended [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  to have very low voter turnout. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=168.24s)]
*  She won that primary with 16,000 votes, and Crowley got about 12,000. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  In this race, we're going to have roughly 900,000 to a million votes cast. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=175.48s)]
*  So Zoran, ultimately, after all the ranked choice voting sorts out, will need probably [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=179.76s)]
*  450,000 or more votes to win. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=184.24s)]
*  And he certainly has a very decent chance of doing that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=186.8s)]
*  So he's operating on—this is the biggest left sort of electoral undertaking since the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=190.84s)]
*  Bernie presidential campaigns. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=196.84s)]
*  And John, I just want to ask you briefly about the role of the real estate industry, the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=199.84s)]
*  landlords of New York. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=203.88000000000002s)]
*  They're investing heavily in Andrew Cuomo, and Michael Bloomberg has tossed in money, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=205.72000000000003s)]
*  several million dollars for Cuomo. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=212.24s)]
*  What's your sense of why the landlords are so upset about the possibility of a Mamdani [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=215.24s)]
*  victory? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=221.4s)]
*  The New York Apartment Association recently made a $2.5 million contribution to Cuomo's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=222.44s)]
*  Super PAC, which has received more than $20 million total from billionaires and major [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=227.96s)]
*  corporations. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=232.88s)]
*  The reason the real estate industry is concerned about Zoran Mamdani for starters, he's made [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  freezing the rent a central part of his platform. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=241.36s)]
*  Here in New York, we sort of have a patchwork of rent laws. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=245.96s)]
*  Going back to the 1940s, they have their origins in World War II, but it continued to this [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=249.28s)]
*  day that provide what's called rent stabilization for about 950,000 apartment units, which covers [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=253.44s)]
*  about 2.4 million New Yorkers. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=260.8s)]
*  And under the laws here, the mayor appoints all nine members of something called the Rent [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=263.4s)]
*  Guidelines Board, and that Rent Guidelines Board each year decides how much landlords, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  they can increase the rent on their tenants. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  Under Eric Adams over the last three years, that Rent Guidelines Board has cumulatively [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=278.92s)]
*  increased the rent by about 9%. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=283.76s)]
*  Under Adams' predecessor, Bill de Blasio, in three out of the eight years, de Blasio [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=286.44s)]
*  was mayor, he froze the rent. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  And Zoran Mamdani has said he will appoint a Rent Guidelines Board, all nine members, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=295.2s)]
*  appointing that will enact a permanent rent freeze for as long as he's mayor. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=300.84s)]
*  So that's certainly one reason the real estate industry is concerned about Zoran. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=307.0s)]
*  In a moment, we're going to speak to Ro Khanna, the congressmember from Silicon Valley, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=311.24s)]
*  who refuses to take super PAC money. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=316.44s)]
*  But if you can finally talk about that issue, we start at the beginning, just for 30 seconds [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=320.24s)]
*  before we go to Congressmember Khanna. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=326.2s)]
*  And that is the issue of rank choice voting. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=328.91999999999996s)]
*  Even for New Yorkers, it's almost new, one previous election. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  What it means that Brad Lander and Zoran Mamdani have co-endorsed each other? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  So, if the polls are anywhere near accurate, the results that come in tonight, Cuomo may [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  be slightly ahead, both candidates somewhere in the mid-30%, and the election will be decided [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=349.7s)]
*  when the rank choice votes are tabulated next Tuesday. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=358.0s)]
*  And Lander seems destined to finish in third place, and he's strongly cross-endorsed with [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=361.48s)]
*  Zoran Mamdani. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=367.24s)]
*  And the polling projections that came out yesterday from Emerson, a leading independent [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=369.0s)]
*  pollster, which showed Zoran winning the election, they showed him winning it when at the final [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=373.68s)]
*  stage of rank choice, when Brad Lander's votes would be reallocated. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=379.68s)]
*  So that cross-endorsement could be decisive. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v-T8Xnh4u0&t=384.34s)]
