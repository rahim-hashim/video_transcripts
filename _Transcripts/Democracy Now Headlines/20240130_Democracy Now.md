**Democracy Now!:** [January 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4nA61FWGjY)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Israeli soldiers raided Jenin's Ibn Sina Hospital earlier
*  today, disguised as civilian women and medical staff, killing three Palestinians.
*  Shocking hospital surveillance footage shows the Israeli forces storming the hospital with
*  guns raised as they search for the three militants they said they were using the facility.
*  The facility is a hideout.
*  Israeli soldiers and settlers have killed more than 370 Palestinians in the West Bank
*  since October 7th, while more than 6,300 people have been arrested.
*  Meanwhile, deadly attacks continue in Gaza, where reports say Israeli strikes killed large
*  numbers of civilians in residential areas of Gaza City.
*  The death toll has now topped 26,700 since the start of Israel's assault.
*  Hamas said it's reviewing a new truce proposal negotiated during weekend talks between Qatar,
*  Egypt, Israel and the United States.
*  Hamas's political chief, Ismail Kaniya, said he'll visit Cairo soon as part of the
*  ongoing negotiations.
*  Hamas has demanded an end to Israel's attacks and a complete withdrawal of occupation forces.
*  Meanwhile, displaced Palestinians continue to flee as Israeli attacks target every part
*  of the besieged territory.
*  This is Suleiman, a young boy who fled Hanunis by wheelchair after he lost his legs in an
*  Israeli airstrike.
*  An average of over 10 children have lost one or both legs each day since Israel's assault
*  started on October 7th.
*  Many amputations have been performed without anesthesia due to the shortage in medical
*  supplies.
*  U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres is meeting with key donors to UNRWA.
*  That's the U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees, after the U.S. and a dozen other countries
*  halted funding for the agency, after Israel accused 12 UNRWA employees of helping Hamas
*  stage the October 7th attack.
*  UNRWA has 13,000 employees.
*  A group of at least 28 organizations, including Action Aid, Oxfam and Save the Children, issued
*  a statement condemning the decision to suspend funding, warning it could lead to a complete
*  collapse of the humanitarian response in Gaza.
*  UNRWA has fired nine staffers in response to the allegations.
*  Apparently, one other is dead as the matter is being investigated.
*  On Monday, the U.N. said Israeli authorities have not directly shared any evidence to substantiate
*  their claims.
*  You know, we've seen this reference to a dossier.
*  We saw it in The Times, in The Wall Street Journal, in CBS.
*  I'm not going to name all the media organizations, but we respect them all.
*  That information has not been given to us officially by the Israeli authorities.
*  UNRWA reported today Israel's attacked its facilities in Gaza at least 260 times, killing
*  at least 360 Palestinians since October 7th.
*  The Pentagon on Monday identified the three U.S. soldiers killed in a drone attack at
*  a base in Jordan over the weekend.
*  Sergeant William Rivers, Specialist Kennedy Sanders and Specialist Brianna Moffitt were
*  all reservists from Georgia, all three of them African-American.
*  Meanwhile, early reports say the drone was able to bypass U.S. air defenses because troops
*  had mistaken it for a U.S. drone returning to the base.
*  A group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed responsibility for the attack.
*  Iran denies any involvement.
*  President Biden has vowed to retaliate.
*  While the White House has said it's not seeking war with Iran, Republican lawmakers
*  are urging the president to bomb Iran directly.
*  Over a dozen Palestinian Muslim students at Harvard filed a federal civil rights complaint
*  with the Department of Education, accusing Harvard of discrimination and failing to protect
*  them from racism and harassment.
*  The students, who are represented by the Muslim Legal Fund of America, say they've been
*  repeatedly targeted for attacks, including doxing, stalking and physical assaults, in
*  cases simply for wearing a Palestinian kaffir on campus.
*  This comes as the City Council of Cambridge, which is home to Harvard, passed a resolution
*  Monday calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the release of remaining hostages.
*  In related news, the University of Michigan Faculty Senate Assembly passed a resolution
*  to demand the school divest from any company profiting from Israel's war on Gaza.
*  In Pakistan, a court has sentenced former Prime Minister Imran Khan to 10 years in prison,
*  accusing him of leaking state secrets.
*  Khan has rejected the charges against him, is politically motivated.
*  He's already serving a three-year prison sentence on corruption charges.
*  Shah Mahmood Qureshi, former foreign minister, top official in Imran Khan's PTI party,
*  has also been sentenced to 10 years.
*  This all comes one week ahead of February 8th elections, which Khan has been barred
*  from.
*  Khan was ousted as prime minister in 2022, blaming the military and rival parties for
*  plotting against him.
*  In other news from Pakistan, the Iranian foreign minister traveled to Islamabad Monday as the
*  two countries moved to de-escalate tensions following deadly airstrikes within each other's
*  borders earlier this month.
*  This is the Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdullah.
*  If you look at the history of Iran and Pakistan, you will see that there have never been any
*  case of the territorial differences or border problems and issues between Iran and Pakistan.
*  So this is one of our prides, and this is one of our very clear manifestations of our
*  good bilateral relations.
*  In Sudan, at least 54 people were killed, including children and two U.N. peacekeepers,
*  in attacks along the border with South Sudan.
*  This weekend's clashes in the oil-rich territory of Abyei, which is claimed by both Sudan and
*  South Sudan, is the deadliest since at least 2021.
*  Meanwhile, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said there's evidence both
*  the Sudanese army and the RSF are committing war crimes in Darfur.
*  This is ICC prosecutor Karim Khan.
*  Karim Khan, ICC prosecutor, Darfur
*  I am compelled to conclude and to report that it is my assessment that we are fast approaching
*  a breaking point and that the conflict in Sudan demands your attention now more than
*  ever.
*  Nearly half of Sudan's 49 million residents are in urgent need of aid, with about 8 million
*  people displaced by the intensifying violence.
*  The U.N. estimates some 12,000 people have been killed, but the true death toll is believed
*  to be much higher.
*  The United States has reinstated economic sanctions on Venezuela following a decision
*  by the Venezuelan Supreme Court to uphold a ban of leading opposition presidential candidate
*  María Carina Machado from running.
*  Elections are scheduled for later this year.
*  The government of President Nicolás Maduro accuses Machado of supporting the harsh U.S.
*  sanctions that have tanked the Venezuelan economy and of backing a U.S.-imposed, unelected,
*  interim opposition government.
*  Machado, who won a primary election held by the opposition last October, spoke yesterday.
*  I received the command of almost 3 million Venezuelans who exercised popular sovereignty
*  on October 22, the opposition primary election day.
*  I represent popular sovereignty.
*  They cannot have elections without me, nor do millions of Venezuelans who voted on that day.
*  The White House has given Maduro's government until April to allow Machado on the ballot.
*  Last October, the U.S. eased some sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry under the condition
*  Maduro allowed opposition candidates to participate in the election.
*  Those sanctions could also be rolled back if the ban on Machado is kept in place.
*  Tension continues to mount on Capitol Hill as the Senate pushes negotiations for a bipartisan
*  border enforcement deal attached to military aid for Ukraine.
*  Far-right Republicans, encouraged by former President Trump, have said they'll sabotage
*  the deal even though it includes some of the harshest immigration restrictions yet, including
*  granting executive authority to block people from applying for asylum once the number of
*  apprehended migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border reaches a daily average of 5,000 in a week.
*  And Biden's already vowed to use the new emergency authorities to shut down the southern
*  border, praising the deal as, quote, the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border
*  we've ever had in our country, unquote.
*  Immigration rights groups have condemned the deal, urging Biden to support humanitarian
*  relief.
*  The proposal also drew criticism from Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
*  Well, that's not realistic.
*  With all due respect, how are we going to solve the migration problems with walls?
*  How are we going to solve migration problems by closing the border?
*  Why these proposals?
*  Because elections are coming.
*  And here in New York, Harlem councilmember and exonerated Central Park 5 member Yousef
*  Salam was pulled over by police Friday night while driving with his family, his wife and
*  four daughters.
*  The dashcam video shows the officer appearing to back off after Salam, who was sworn in
*  less than a month ago, identifies himself as a member of the New York City Council.
*  Salam says the officer never responded to his request to know why he was being stopped.
*  The NYPD later said it's because his car windows were illegally tinted and he had an
*  out-of-state license plate.
*  The incident comes as the New York City Council appears poised to override Mayor Eric Adams'
*  veto on a police accountability bill and legislation that bans solitary confinement in prisons.
*  Intro 586, known as the How Many Stops Act, would mandate officers record demographic
*  information and give a reason for stopping people.
*  Last week, councilmembers, including Yousef Salam, faith leaders and community organizers,
*  gathered in support of the act.
*  This is activist Crystal Waffle.
*  This Intro 586 is not going to stop everything in this moment, but it will give us the data,
*  the information, it will call on our NYPD to act differently.
*  In the 10 years that faith in New York has been in existence, we have stood on those
*  city hall steps too many times for people who have been murdered by police.
*  One too many times.
*  We have stood on these city hall steps too many times demanding that the NYPD be transparent.
*  We have stood on these steps too many times asking and demanding accountability, asking
*  and demanding that our NYPD stop killing our people.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman in New York, joined by Democracy Now! co-host Juan González in Chicago.
*  Hi Juan.
*  Hi Amy, and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around
*  the world.
