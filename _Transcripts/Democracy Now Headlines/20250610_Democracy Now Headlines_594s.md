Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland father who was wrongfully sent to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador in March, is now in federal custody in Tennessee after being returned to the United States over the weekend. He now faces federal criminal charges that he was illegally transporting undocumented immigrants within the U.S. "He's still far away from what we want, which is for him to be freed and returned to his family," says Chris Newman, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia's family and legal director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. Newman draws connections between the L.A. anti-ICE protests and Abrego Garcia's first encounter with law enforcement in 2019 at a Home Depot, where a now-fired Maryland police officer accused him of being a potential MS-13 gang member and handed him over to ICE.

# Kilmar Abrego Garcia's Lawyer: Trump Admin's Trafficking Charges Must Be Viewed with "Suspicion"
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Juan Gonz√°lez. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  We turn now for an update on Kilmar Obrego-Garcia, the Maryland father who was wrongfully sent [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  to a maximum-security megaprison in El Salvador in March, now facing federal charges in Tennessee [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=10.26s)]
*  after being returned to the U.S. last week. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=17.36s)]
*  A two-count indictment unsealed Friday in Nashville alleges Obrego-Garcia was illegally transporting [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=20.48s)]
*  undocumented immigrants within the United States. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=25.48s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the charges in an unusual move. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=28.68s)]
*  She also described allegations against Obrego-Garcia that were not in the indictment and seemed [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=32.04s)]
*  flustered when questioned about this by Wall Street Journal reporter Sadie Gurman. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=36.92s)]
*  Maybe I misunderstood you, but you were mentioning, you know, that he had some involvement in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=41.8s)]
*  a murder, you know, or was connected to groups that had, you know, involved with this other [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=47.24s)]
*  smuggling ring. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=52.36s)]
*  To be clear, the only charges he's facing right now are the, like, you know, human smuggling [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  charges, just this, that's the one offense. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=59.92s)]
*  But the other things that you have talked about are not actually in the indictment? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=63.32000000000001s)]
*  No, co-conspirators allege that, and we were clear to say that he is charged with, not [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  only very serious charges of alien smuggling. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=74.44s)]
*  And again, there were children involved in that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=78.92s)]
*  You know, human trafficking, not only in our country but in our world, is very, very real. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=81.48s)]
*  A hearing set for Friday will determine whether Kilmar Obrego-Garcia will remain in custody. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=88.56s)]
*  For more, we're joined by Chris Newman, a lawyer for Kilmar's family and legal director [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=94.72s)]
*  of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network based in Los Angeles. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=100.04s)]
*  Thanks so much for being with us. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=104.84s)]
*  Start off by talking about his case. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=106.56s)]
*  As I listened to one of his lawyers speaking the other day, he said he learned that Kilmar [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=108.86s)]
*  was in the United States from the media, the way the rest of people learned. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=114.61999999999999s)]
*  That's correct. We all did. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=124.74s)]
*  We are obviously relieved that he is now back in the United States a little bit closer in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=127.13999999999999s)]
*  proximity to his wife and family. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=133.62s)]
*  That's certainly much better than being in functionally a black site in El Salvador, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=137.78s)]
*  but he's still a far away from what we want, which is for him to be freed and returned [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=142.34s)]
*  to his family. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  And has his wife or his mother been able to see him now that he's back in the United States? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  They've been able to speak to him for the first time. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  And remember, we didn't even know if he was alive after April 17th. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=162.82s)]
*  The last time that we had heard from him was through Senator Von Hollen when he and I went [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=168.1s)]
*  to El Salvador, and we were able to briefly get proof of life and make sure that his health [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=173.7s)]
*  was okay. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=179.54s)]
*  He wasn't aware of all the allegations that were being hurled at him by the president [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=180.74s)]
*  of the United States, by all of the legal accusations against him. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=185.14s)]
*  And then after that, we had no contact. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  No one had contact with him. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=191.29999999999998s)]
*  But thankfully, Jennifer is now able to at least talk to him by phone and hopefully we'll [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=193.29999999999998s)]
*  be able to see him soon. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=198.26s)]
*  And can you talk about the significance of these federal charges in Tennessee that have [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=202.26s)]
*  been unsealed? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=206.26s)]
*  Well, they have to be treated with the highest amount of suspicion given the unprecedented [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=208.89999999999998s)]
*  amount of defamation and disinformation that has been directed at Kilmar and his family. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=213.85999999999999s)]
*  You know, I went to law school 20 years ago. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=220.17999999999998s)]
*  I studied history. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=222.17999999999998s)]
*  Never have I ever heard of or am aware of a case where the president of the United States [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=224.17999999999998s)]
*  has been as ineligible as the president of the United States. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=230.18s)]
*  I think it's astonishing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=234.18s)]
*  I think we're going to have to fight very, very hard to make sure that he gets a fair [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=236.18s)]
*  trial given the extent to which the, you know, the court of public opinion has been, for [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=240.18s)]
*  example, tainted by all of the really truly awful things that have been said by the president [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=246.18s)]
*  and his cronies. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=252.18s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=254.18s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=256.18s)]
*  I think we're going to have to fight very, very hard to make sure that he gets a fair [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=258.18s)]
*  trial given the extent to which the president of the United States has been as ineligible [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=262.18s)]

*  And I think we're going to have to fight very, very hard to make sure that he gets a fair [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=330.18s)]
*  trial given the extent to which the president of the United States. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=332.18s)]
*  He was falsely accused of being a gang member by a corrupt local police who subsequently [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=334.18s)]
*  was fired and himself pled guilty for misuse of confidential informant information. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=340.18s)]
*  I'm so grateful to Greg Sargent from the New Republic for unearthing that story. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=346.18s)]
*  It hasn't been discussed enough. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=350.18s)]
*  When he was taken into custody after those false charges of him being a gang member or violent or et cetera, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=352.18s)]
*  they said, oopsie, we made a mistake, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=359.18s)]
*  but they handed him over to ICE. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=363.18s)]
*  Now, at this point, it's important to understand, had there been a sanctuary policy in place [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=365.18s)]
*  of the kind that we have in California, Kilmar never would have been transferred to ICE in the first place. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=370.18s)]
*  He then won, functionally won his immigration case, won withholding of removal, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=375.18s)]
*  got work authorization, joined a union, was bettering his life when he was then picked up in this alien enemy's sweep and stunt. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=381.18s)]
*  The attorney, by the way, who admitted mistake in federal court, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=391.18s)]
*  Rez, is somebody I know because he was opposing counsel challenging our sanctuary policies in Los Angeles. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=395.18s)]
*  This guy is a believer. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=402.18s)]
*  He was a Trump guy and he admitted mistake. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=404.18s)]
*  And then, of course, President Bukele then says, oopsie, when he is outside of U.S. airspace. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=407.18s)]
*  And I think the nexus to your point, Amy, is the following. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=414.18s)]
*  I've been down to El Salvador three times in the last month trying to liberate Kilmar. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=418.18s)]
*  But what people in El Salvador say is that, number one, there are tens of thousands of people in El Salvador in similar situations as Kilmar. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=423.18s)]
*  No one knows where they are, if they're alive, what they're being charged for, why they're being put in CICOT or other prisons. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=432.18s)]
*  But number two, what they said to every single congressman is you and the United States need to act fast [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=438.18s)]
*  because El Salvador is in essence the ghost of Christmas future for what's to come in the United States. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=445.18s)]
*  In El Salvador, Bukele has become authoritarian. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=452.18s)]
*  He's become a fascist. He's removed all the guardrails. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=456.18s)]
*  And everyone in El Salvador said you all need to work now to preserve the rule of law and the guardrails because we can see that Trump is in essence [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=458.18s)]
*  importing the political technology of President Bukele in El Salvador. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=468.18s)]
*  And what we see in Los Angeles is people trying to protect the innocent the best way that they know how by going out into the streets. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=474.18s)]
*  And yes, it's messy. I'm so grateful that you asked that question of Attorney General Bonta. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=483.18s)]
*  I really do hope that he investigates the role of Cash Patel and other, you know, it's hard to even say it, but like Dan Bongino, who's I don't know, the number two in command in the FBI. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=489.18s)]
*  I think it's very important that we investigate the role of whether or not there are federal agents as provocateurs because on Fox News, Sean Hannity says that it's the protesters, immigrants, anarchists throwing bottles. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=503.18s)]
*  It is equally as likely that there are federal agents that are themselves trying to stoke violence. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=515.18s)]
*  I've seen it before. You know, you know, I was counsel on the case challenging SB 1070 and challenging Joe Rapallo. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=521.18s)]
*  That was a common practice that they would put undercover, plainclothes people to disguise themselves among protesters in order to provoke violence, to then deter protest. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=530.18s)]
*  Because again, the other message is if these protests are perceived to be unsafe, then people are deterred from going out and expressing their First Amendment rights. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUIKQ6pXEY&t=541.18s)]
