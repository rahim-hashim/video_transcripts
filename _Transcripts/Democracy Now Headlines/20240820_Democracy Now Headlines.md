# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” August 20, 204
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns5SLe6Dcis)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, War Peace and the Presidency, where breaking
*  with convention.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  President Biden took to the stage on the first night of the Democratic National Convention
*  Monday where he passed the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris.
*  Selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made when I became our nominee.
*  And it was the best decision I made my whole career.
*  A few minutes into Biden's remarks, protesters dropped a sign that read, Stop Arming Israel.
*  The sign was quickly wrestled away from protesters.
*  We'll speak to three delegates involved in last night's actions in hour two of our
*  live DNC broadcast.
*  The DNC on Monday evening voted to adopt the party's official platform, which does not
*  call for an arms embargo on Israel and reasserts unwavering U.S. support for Israel.
*  Among other high-profile speakers Monday night was New York Congressmember Alexandria
*  Ocasio-Cortez.
*  We have a chance to elect a president who is for the middle class because she is from
*  the middle class.
*  She understands the urgency of rent checks and groceries and prescriptions.
*  She is as committed to our reproductive and civil rights as she is to taking on corporate
*  greed.
*  And she is working tirelessly to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and bringing hostages home.
*  New York Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's speech came after her fellow squad members
*  Cory Bush and Jamal Bowman recently lost their house seats after AIPAC poured tens of millions
*  of dollars into their primary challengers' campaigns.
*  Also on the first night of the DNC, three speakers, Amanda Zyrowski, Kaitlyn Joshua
*  and Hadley Duvall, shared their experiences from the podium with abortion, a central issue
*  in November's election.
*  Zyrowski was one of a group of women who sued Texas last year after they were denied abortions
*  even as their pregnancies posed serious risks to their health and were non-viable.
*  Kaitlyn Joshua described her experience living through Louisiana's abortion ban.
*  Two years ago, my husband and I were expecting our second child.
*  Our daughter Lauren couldn't wait to be a big sister.
*  I was getting ready for her fourth birthday party when something didn't feel right.
*  Two emergency rooms sent me away.
*  Because of Louisiana's abortion ban, no one would confirm that I was miscarrying.
*  I was in pain, bleeding so much my husband feared for my life.
*  No woman should experience what I endured, but too many have.
*  They write to me saying, what happened to you happened to me.
*  Sometimes they're miscarrying, scared to tell anyone, even their doctors.
*  Our daughters deserve better.
*  America deserves better.
*  We'll have more on the first day of the Democratic National Convention inside and out after headlines.
*  Thousands of protesters took to the streets Monday as part of the march on the DNC.
*  Nick Tilson is an Oglala Lakota leader and president of the NDN Collective.
*  I'm here to remind America that this election is happening on the stolen lands of indigenous
*  people and the land back movement stands in solidarity with a free Palestine and to end
*  all military aid to the state of Israel and stop the genocide.
*  Amidst heavy police presence, a group of protesters broke off from the main march and headed to
*  the United Center where they breached a security fence as they chanted, whose streets are streets,
*  before police began making arrests outside the DNC.
*  We'll hear a number of those voices after headlines.
*  During a separate action Monday, Sherry Hankala, with the Poor People's Army, was also arrested
*  near the United Center after she crossed a police line as she attempted to walk into
*  the DNC to deliver a citizen's arrest warrant for Democratic leaders the Poor People's
*  Army has accused of crimes against humanity.
*  This is Hankala speaking before her arrest.
*  Either arrest me or let me continue to walk.
*  Am I under arrest?
*  If I'm not, I will continue to walk.
*  You do not have a right to beat or hurt me.
*  Hankala led a similar action in Milwaukee last month, the site of the Republican National
*  Convention, where she was also arrested.
*  Several members of the Poor People's Army walked from Milwaukee to Chicago ahead of
*  the Democratic National Convention.
*  To see our interview with Sherry Hankala in Milwaukee, go to democracynow.org.
*  Another speaker to take the stage on the first night of the Democratic National Convention
*  was United Auto Workers President Sean Fain.
*  So for us in the labor movement, it's real simple.
*  Kamala Harris is one of us.
*  She's a fighter for the working class.
*  And Donald Trump is a scab.
*  As the DNC got underway, hundreds of nurses from the University of Illinois Hospital stood
*  as they kicked off a week-long strike just a few miles from the United Convention Center.
*  The Illinois Nurses Association says UI Health has refused to address understaffing, unsafe
*  working conditions and fair pay demands.
*  In more labor news, over a thousand workers at New York's Cornell University are on
*  strike over pay and benefits and over Cornell's refusal to negotiate in good faith, they say.
*  The strike comes as Cornell students started streaming onto campus for the start of the
*  new school year.
*  The Cornell workers, which include maintenance and dining room staff, gardeners and custodians,
*  say they can't afford to live near campus on their salary and often struggle to afford
*  other basic necessities.
*  They're unionized with United Auto Workers.
*  UAW President Sean Fain gave the striking Cornell workers a shout-out from the DNC stage
*  last night.
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted
*  a U.S. proposal that would bridge remaining differences in achieving a Gaza ceasefire
*  and urged Hamas to do the same.
*  Hamas called out the hypocrisy of Blinken's announcement and repeated its demand that
*  any deal must result in a permanent end to Israel's war on Gaza and accusing the U.S.
*  merely buying time for Israel to continue its genocide, unquote, by watering down a
*  previous agreement.
*  Despite the news from Blinken, who's now in Egypt to garner support for the deal, Israel's
*  carnage in Gaza continues unabated.
*  The U.N. warned Monday Israel is now relentlessly striking the besieged territory, with almost
*  all Gazans displaced and some resorting to living among the rubble.
*  Amidst Israel's barrage of evacuation orders, an unionist distraught family members gathered
*  at the Nasser Hospital morgue after Israeli strikes earlier today killed at least 11 people,
*  including children.
*  This is researcher and professor Iyad Abu Mustafa speaking outside the hospital.
*  The occupying state continues to carry out brutal operations day after day.
*  Yesterday, 18 martyrs were killed, and this morning, more than 10 martyrs.
*  The number of martyrs has reached more than 44,000 martyrs.
*  This escalation indicates a crime of genocide, a well-organized crime.
*  Every bloodbath is a crime in itself.
*  There is no country in the world that is able to stop these serious violations against the
*  Palestinian people.
*  The United States is still taking the neutral stance and is blindly biased towards the occupying
*  Israeli state.
*  Meanwhile, Israel says it's retrieved the bodies of six Israeli hostages from Khan Yunis
*  overnight.
*  The families of hostages have been calling on Netanyahu to work towards a ceasefire in
*  Gaza for months.
*  Back in the United States, in Wisconsin, a Kenosha County court has sentenced Crystal
*  Kaiser to 11 years in prison after she pleaded guilty to charges related to the killing and
*  the man who sex trafficked and assaulted her in 2018.
*  She was 17 years old at the time.
*  He'd abused her since she was 16.
*  Court records show Kenosha police knew the man, Randall Volar, who was white, had a history
*  of sexually abusing black girls, and was under investigation for sex trafficking, but he
*  remained free four months.
*  Kaiser says she shot and killed Volar in self-defense after he drugged her and tried to rape her.
*  In Georgia, the Republican-controlled Election Board approved a new rule Monday giving county
*  election board officials more power to examine votes after Election Day, a move which could
*  delay the certification of results and allow officials who are unhappy with the results
*  to sow chaos and doubt over the election.
*  ProPublica reports the new rule was pushed by the far-right group Election Integrity
*  Network, which is run by Cleta Mitchell, an election denier who tried to help Trump
*  overturn his loss in Georgia in 2020.
*  In New York, former Republican Congressmember George Santos pleaded guilty to federal wire
*  fraud and identity theft charges.
*  Among other things, Santos admitted to defrauding his donors by using their money for personal
*  use and charging their cards without authorization, as well as lying about his finances on House
*  disclosure forms.
*  The former Congressman Santos' guilty plea comes just weeks before he was scheduled to
*  stand trial.
*  Last year, he was expelled from the House in a rare move, putting an end to his brief
*  congressional career.
*  Santos will be sentenced in February.
*  He faces at least two years in prison.
*  This is Nassau District Attorney Ann Donnelly.
*  George Santos is many things.
*  He's a liar.
*  He's a master manipulator and a con man.
*  But one thing he's not.
*  He's not above the law.
*  The advocacy group Tax Justice Network said even a modest wealth tax on the world's
*  richest could easily raise $2 trillion each year, more than enough to help poorer nations
*  become climate resilient and transition to clean energy.
*  The group cited Spain's Solidarity Surcharge, implemented less than two years ago, which
*  raised hundreds of millions of euros last year simply by imposing a small progressive
*  tax on the net worth of the 0.5 percent richest households.
*  The Tax Justice Network released its proposal for a global tax on the ultra-rich ahead of
*  November's UN climate change conference in Baku, Azerbaijan.
*  Democracy Now! will be there.
*  In related news, the Southern African development community warns some 68 million people, nearly
*  one-fifth of the population of Southern Africa, are suffering from the effects of a severe
*  climate change-fueled drought.
*  Meanwhile, Azerbaijan is sounding the alarm over the catastrophic shrinking of the Caspian
*  Sea due to changes in the climate.
*  Azerbaijan's President Ilham Liev said he discussed the situation with Russian President
*  Vladimir Putin on Monday.
*  From the window of the room where we held talks, I showed Vladimir Putin the rocks that
*  were underwater two years ago, and today they have already emerged a meter above the surface.
*  And we are seeing this along the entire coast of the Absheren Peninsula, and not only there,
*  along the entire coast of Azerbaijan.
*  The Caspian Sea is the world's largest inland body of water and is bordered by Azerbaijan,
*  Kazakhstan, Russia, Iran and Turkmenistan.
*  Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, will host November's upcoming UN climate talks.
*  And in some more hopeful climate news, environmental groups in the U.S. hailed a major milestone
*  as new federal data revealed wind and solar overtook energy production from coal in the
*  first half of this year, and the trend is likely to continue for the rest of the year.
*  Ben Jealous, head of the Sierra Club, said the news represents a quote, significant win
*  for clean energy advocates, for ratepayers and for people in communities across the country
*  that simply want to breathe clean air, drink safe water and worry less about climate disasters
*  like floods and wildfires, Ben Jealous said.
*  Ukraine has ordered families to evacuate Russia's eastern city of Pokrovsk as Ukrainian forces
*  continue to advance in Russia's Kursk region.
*  Russian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday Ukrainian attacks in the region showed
*  Moscow's threats of retaliation were a bluff.
*  We are now experiencing an extremely important ideological shift, namely the entire naive,
*  illusory concept of so-called red lines regarding Russia, which dominated the assessment of
*  the war by some of our partners, has crumbled these days somewhere near Sudza.
*  Russian military bases and Russian military airfields, Russian logistics and other military
*  facilities whose existence allows Putin to avoid seeking peace are entirely illegitimate
*  targets for our defense forces.
*  In Mexico, unions representing judicial workers launched an indefinite strike Monday as lawmakers
*  prepared to vote on a highly contested court reform.
*  Judges joined other court workers in opposing the proposed overhaul, which would see judges,
*  including those on the Mexican Supreme Court, be elected by the people.
*  The striking unions warned courts are the only counterweight to the ruling Morena Party's
*  authority.
*  This is judicial employee Maria Cisneros speaking in Mexico City.
*  We are not against reform.
*  All reforms are good, but not from a discourse of hatred, polarization and saying that the
*  judiciary is evil, that the judiciary is corrupt.
*  In India, hundreds of thousands of doctors have prolonged their nationwide strike over
*  the rape and murder of a young medical trainee in a Calcutta hospital earlier this month.
*  Doctors at public hospitals turned away all but emergency patients Monday as they continued
*  to take to the streets in protest.
*  It's not a rape of a doctor.
*  It's not a rape of a doctor.
*  It's a rape of a daughter.
*  She was a daughter.
*  She was a mother.
*  Sister.
*  So, if we do not raise a voice for ourselves, then no one ever will.
*  And in health news, authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo say they are hopeful the
*  country will receive its first doses of M-Pax vaccines by next week after pledges from the
*  U.S. and Japan.
*  The World Health Organization declared M-Pax a global public health emergency last week,
*  but the disease has overwhelmingly affected West and Central African nations so far, especially
*  the DRC, where M-Pax was already endemic.
*  But access to vaccines is low or nonexistent.
*  One of the strains detected is believed to be more lethal than previous ones.
*  Even when not deadly, M-Pax can cause fever, rashes and extremely painful lesions.
*  Children are particularly vulnerable.
*  Meanwhile, shares of M-Pax vaccine manufacturers are surging following the WHO public health
*  emergency declaration.
*  Geovax Labs, Tonics Pharmaceuticals and Emergent BioSolutions are some of the companies hoping
*  to profit from the M-Pax crisis.
*  Those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, War, Peace and the Presidency, Breaking with
*  Convention.
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Juan GonzÃ¡lez.
*  We're broadcasting from the studios of Cannes TV here in Chicago.
*  Hi Juan.
*  Hi Amy and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around
*  the world.
