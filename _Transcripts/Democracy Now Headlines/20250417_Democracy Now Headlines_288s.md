President Trump’s Africa envoy Massad Boulos has finished a tour of several East African nations, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where he discussed a peace deal that could involve the U.S. tapping the country’s rich mineral resources, including cobalt and lithium. Several Western mining companies are already reportedly lined up to take part in the U.S.-backed mineral resources partnership. “These people are among the poorest in the world,” says Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. “They live on top of the incredible mineral riches that have been plundered by so many companies, so many colonial powers, so many of the neighbors of DRC. I hope the U.S. will really make sure there is an equitable deal, but that can really only happen if there is a peace agreement.”

*  This is Masad Boulous speaking last weekend in Kigali, Rwanda, which neighbors the DRC. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=30.96s)]
*  I can confirm and I can affirm that the United States also remains committed to this effort [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=36.16s)]
*  and is ready to facilitate an end to the conflict, obviously a peaceful end to this conflict, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=45.36s)]
*  an end that allows countries to secure their borders and lays the foundation for a thriving [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=53.76s)]
*  regional economy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=62.04s)]
*  Rwanda has long been accused of propping up M23 fighters who have been steadily advancing [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  an eastern DRC, exacerbating an already catastrophic humanitarian situation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=70.44s)]
*  Over 7,000 people have been killed since the start of the year. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=75.64s)]
*  Over 1 million others forcibly displaced. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=79.82s)]
*  Jan Eglund, as secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, you just recently returned [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=82.76s)]
*  from the eastern DRC. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=89.36s)]
*  If you can end this conversation by talking about the gravity of the situation there and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=91.58s)]
*  what needs to happen as the U.S. once again, a kind of reprise of a very shameful history, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=97.32s)]
*  is working on a mineral deal with the DRC. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=106.08s)]
*  The Democratic Republic of Congo has been in turmoil, in fighting now for more than [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=112.08s)]
*  a generation and especially in the eastern part of the country. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  And it has also, like Sudan, had a lot of attention in the past. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=123.48s)]
*  Now neglect, really. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=129.32s)]
*  I was in Goma, which is the capital of the eastern part of the DRC and the provinces [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=132.28s)]
*  of Kivu, fully under control of this rebel group, the M23. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=140.2s)]
*  They have taken not only Goma, which was more than 2 million people, but also Bukavu, more [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  than a million people in South Kivu. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  Paradoxically, by them controlling the whole area, people can now return home. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=158.32s)]
*  So for the first time in my many years of traveling to eastern Congo, many people had [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=164.88s)]
*  returned home, 1.8 million. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=170.16s)]
*  I met them in four communities where the Norwegian Refugee Council is helping them reintegrate [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=172.44s)]
*  on their ancestral land. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=179.92s)]
*  We will give them seeds. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  We will help them with farming and with education and with water again. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=182.6s)]
*  They're happy to be back. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  But 1.2 million others were displaced by the recent fighting when M23 took this territory [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  from the central government army. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=198.68s)]
*  So I hope the US will really do two things. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=202.32s)]
*  I presume being the largest aid provider to the Democratic Republic of Congo, many of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  the aid organizations are dependent from 50 to 100 percent of their aid operations in [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=213.28s)]
*  the US. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=220.56s)]
*  And when everything is cut overnight, of course, it has a devastating impact. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=221.56s)]
*  And even now, when we could help people home and we could solve some of the problems. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=227.16s)]
*  And the minerals, yes, these people are among the poorest in the world. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  They're among the most abused. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=238.55999999999997s)]
*  And they live on top of the incredible mineral riches that have been plundered by so many [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=240.83999999999997s)]
*  companies, so many colonial powers, so many of the neighbors of DLC. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=249.39999999999998s)]
*  I hope the US will really make sure that there is an equitable deal that can benefit the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=256.32s)]
*  people. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=262.6s)]
*  But that can only happen if there is a peace agreement and that has to involve the central [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  government, the Rwandan neighboring country, Uganda, Burundi and the largest rebel groups, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=269.32000000000005s)]
*  including M23. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xl4zznzRC8&t=278.92s)]
