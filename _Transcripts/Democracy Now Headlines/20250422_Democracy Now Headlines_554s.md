We speak with Mudassar Toppa, part of Öztürk's legal team and a staff attorney at CLEAR, a legal nonprofit and clinic at CUNY School of Law. "In this case, the government was clear it was intending to abduct Ms. Öztürk. They didn't want her to know that her visa was revoked, and four days later, they did exactly what they planned and abducted her in broad daylight," says Toppa.

# Update on Abduction & Jailing of Tufts Student Rümeysa Öztürk
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Juan González. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=3.0s)]
*  A federal judge has ordered the Turkish national Tufts University Ph.D. student Ramesa Ozturk [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=4.96s)]
*  to be transferred to Vermont no later than May 1st, as she seeks to challenge what her [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  lawyers call her unconstitutional detention in an ICE jail in Louisiana. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  That order came Friday and followed a separate hearing last Wednesday, when an immigration [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=23.32s)]
*  denied bond for Ramesa, declaring her to be a potential so-called danger to the community. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=28.2s)]
*  Ramesa, who is from Turkey, was arrested for co-authoring a student op-ed on Tufts' response [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=35.2s)]
*  to Gaza's solidarity protests on campus. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=42.76s)]
*  Ramesa Ozturk is a doctoral candidate in the school's Department of Child Study and Human [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=46.56s)]
*  Development and research assistant at Tufts' Children's Television Project. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=50.96s)]
*  She's a former Fulbright scholar. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=54.96s)]
*  On March 25th, masked, plain-clothes immigration agents snatched her from the streets of Summerville, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=57.8s)]
*  Massachusetts, outside Tufts. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=64.64s)]
*  Surveillance video from a nearby house shows agents approaching her on the streets near [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=67.16s)]
*  her home. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=71.5s)]
*  In the video, you can hear her scream as the agents move to detain her. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=72.64s)]
*  Apparently, she said something like, I'm calling the police, and they said something [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=84.72s)]
*  like they are the police. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=95.24s)]
*  The Washington Post reports the State Department found no evidence linking Ramesa Ozturk to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=96.86s)]
*  anti-Semitic activities or public statements in support of terrorism. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=102.84s)]
*  The Washington Post reports a State Department memo determined Secretary of State Marco [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=107.24s)]
*  Rubio did not have sufficient grounds for revoking her visa, contradicting public accusations [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=111.24s)]
*  made by the Trump administration. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=116.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Tufts University Democrats and Republicans have released a joint statement [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=118.44s)]
*  condemning the Trump administration's arrest and detention of Ramesa and its overall attack [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  on international students and their right to free speech. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=130.48s)]
*  As she awaits transfer to Vermont, Ramesa is jailed at a privately run ICE jail in Louisiana. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=133.72s)]
*  Furthermore, we're joined by one of Ramesa's attorneys, Madasir Tapa, staff attorney at [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=140.72s)]
*  CLEAR, a legal nonprofit clinic at CUNY School of Law. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=145.0s)]
*  Madasir, welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=151.88s)]
*  Can you explain exactly what happened? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  This is also happening, as another judge ruled that something like 130 international students [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=156.66s)]
*  have to have their visas reinstated. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=166.84s)]
*  Yes, thank you, Amy, for having me. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=169.84s)]
*  So there's two parallel tracks in Ms. Ozturk's case. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=174.32s)]
*  There's the immigration proceedings that you mentioned that involved this bond proceeding [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=177.76s)]
*  that happened last Wednesday, where the immigration judge found that based on this one paragraph [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  memo from the State Department that says that the only evidence that's cited is this op-ed [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=191.96s)]
*  that she co-authored that references a common cause with an organization that was later [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=199.76s)]
*  temporarily banned from campus as supporting a finding that she was a danger to her community [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=205.8s)]
*  or a flight risk. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=212.08s)]
*  And so those proceedings are happening on a parallel track to the habeas proceedings [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=213.8s)]
*  that are happening in federal court. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=218.74s)]
*  Ms. Ozturk's initial petition was filed in the District Court of Massachusetts. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=221.16s)]
*  That was eventually transferred to the District of Vermont because at the time that petition [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  was filed, that's where she was. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  And the court heard arguments on the government's motion to dismiss and our motion for bail [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=233.92s)]
*  and for Ms. Ozturk's release. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=242.2s)]
*  And this last Friday, the court rejected the government's arguments and held that it did [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=244.72s)]
*  have jurisdiction to hear her claims. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=251.08s)]
*  And so Ms. Ozturk's transfer has now been ordered. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=253.08s)]
*  She's been ordered to be transferred back to Vermont and the court has also ordered [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=256.16s)]
*  a bail hearing to happen on May 9th and a hearing to hear the underlying merits of her [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=260.88s)]
*  habeas petition on May 22nd. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=266.72s)]
*  And this is important, at least with respect to cases involving ideological retaliation [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=269.16s)]
*  against students for their advocacy for Palestinian human rights. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=275.4s)]
*  This is the first federal court that's actually said it has jurisdiction to hear these claims [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=279.68s)]
*  and is moving on to that phase of the process. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=284.92s)]
*  And with respect to the temporary restraining orders that have been handed down in other [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  courts regarding visa revocations writ large, those are happening not just in Georgia but [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=296.32s)]
*  throughout the country. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  As far as I'm aware, I think there have been at least six TROs issued and some of those [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=304.28s)]
*  have extended beyond just the individual plaintiffs in those cases. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=311.32s)]
*  And I wanted to ask you, this whole issue of her student visa being revoked on March [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=318.08s)]
*  21st without even her knowledge, could you talk about that and the implications of that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=323.23999999999995s)]
*  for other international students? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=329.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's really chilling. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=332.28s)]
*  So the same memo that the government submits in Ms. Osterk's removal case, this one paragraph [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=336.32s)]
*  memo from the State Department, it has this underlying portion, and this is underlined [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=343.84s)]
*  by the government itself that says due to ongoing ICE operational security, this revocation [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=348.55999999999995s)]
*  will be silent. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=353.79999999999995s)]
*  And this is completely abnormal. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=355.28s)]
*  The government is normally going to notify students that there's been a revocation. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=356.88s)]
*  Generally revocations will take place because of some issues regarding the student perhaps [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=361.84s)]
*  not maintaining a full course load or a criminal offense that renders them unable to maintain [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=367.0s)]
*  their student status. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  So typically students are given notice and they're given the opportunity to pursue other [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=375.6s)]
*  avenues of relief, potentially seeking a different type of visa or self-deportation or just leaving [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  the country. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=387.68s)]
*  In this case, the government was clear it was intending to abduct Ms. Osterk. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=388.68s)]
*  They didn't want her to know that her visa was revoked, and four days later they did [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=393.56s)]
*  exactly what they planned and abducted her in broad daylight in the street on Massachusetts. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=397.6s)]
*  Could you talk about the role of Canary Mission and others like it in essentially identifying [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=404.8s)]
*  for the government people that they should be deporting? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=412.2s)]
*  Yeah, and I think at this point there's been a clear connection that we can draw from the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=415.76s)]
*  doxing organizations, the pro-Israeli doxing organizations, and there is a clear doxing [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=425.2s)]
*  to deportation pipeline that's taking place. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=430.0s)]
*  In Ms. Osterk's case it's even more apparent because Ms. Osterk was not a known organizer [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=433.68s)]
*  or advocate for any cause really. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=440.88s)]
*  And Ms. Osterk's sole publicly identifiable association to the movement against the genocide [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=444.8s)]
*  and the movement for Palestinian human rights was this co-authored op-ed in her school newspaper [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=453.15999999999997s)]
*  that was really just asking the university to respect the wishes and the vote of the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=459.68s)]
*  Student Senate. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  And all of a sudden in February of 2025, almost a year after she's co-written this op-ed, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  Canary Mission publishes a page on her doxing her and alleging that she's engaged in anti-Semitic [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=478.88s)]
*  behavior because of this co-authored op-ed. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=486.24s)]
*  And less than a month later she's abducted by ICE. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  And so it's very chilling that the government seems to be taking their marching orders from [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=493.92s)]
*  these private doxing organizations with mysterious funding and backing. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=499.52s)]
*  And I think it underscores why the government's actions are simply unconscionable. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=505.36s)]
*  Well, we'll continue to cover Ramesa's case, see if they will send her back to Vermont, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=513.36s)]
*  where the masked agents drove her to before sending her to Louisiana. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=520.96s)]
*  But Dasar Tappa, thanks so much for being with us, one of the attorneys for Ramesa Osterk, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=525.52s)]
*  a staff attorney at CLEAR, a legal clinic at CUNY School of Law. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=529.76s)]
*  Again, the Democrats and Republicans at Tufts sent a joint letter objecting to her treatment, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=535.04s)]
*  as did Tufts University. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP3ySzL-5T8&t=540.48s)]
