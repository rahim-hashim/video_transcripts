# Top U.S. & World Headlines — January 23, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [January 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHksLX3ZvwA)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel has reportedly proposed halting its assault on Gaza for two months, in exchange
*  for the release of more than 100 hostages remaining in Gaza.
*  According to Axios, the proposed deal would also involve the release of Palestinians imprisoned
*  by Israel, but it would not end the war in Gaza.
*  Axios reports Israel has given the proposal to Hamas through mediators from Qatar and
*  Egypt.
*  Separately, CNN reports Israel proposed allowing top Hamas officials to leave Gaza as part
*  of a broader ceasefire negotiation.
*  President Biden's Middle East coordinator, Brett McGurk, is in Egypt and will soon head
*  to Qatar.
*  This comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces increasing political pressure
*  to bring home the hostages.
*  Earlier today, Israel announced 24 of its soldiers were killed in Gaza on Monday, in
*  the deadliest day for Israeli forces since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th, bringing
*  the number of Israeli soldier casualties to over 200.
*  Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen.
*  The United Nations is warning 570,000 Palestinians face catastrophic hunger.
*  Health officials in Gaza say 195 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes over the past
*  24 hours.
*  Israeli forces have reportedly surrounded the city of Khan Yunis while attacking areas
*  where thousands of Palestinians have sought shelter, including at Al-Aqsa University.
*  This is a Palestinian child who fled the school with his family.
*  We hardly made it out of the university under the shelling.
*  We didn't expect the tanks at the university's gates.
*  We hardly made it out.
*  Every day I see children die.
*  Every day children die.
*  Many of my friends died last night at Al-Aqsa University.
*  According to the Gaza Health Ministry, over 25,000 Palestinians have died in Gaza, more
*  than 10,000 of them children.
*  In other news from the region, the 18-year-old Israeli war resistor Tal Mitnick has been
*  sentenced to an additional 30 days in military prison.
*  Visit democracynow.org to see our interview with Mitnick last week.
*  He's the first Israeli resistor in the Gaza assault.
*  The U.S. and U.K. launched fresh strikes on eight Houthi targets in Yemen Monday.
*  It's the second time the two countries conducted a joint attack on the eighth strike by U.S.
*  forces against the Iran-backed Houthi movement in Yemen over the past two weeks, and retaliation
*  for Houthi forces targeting ships in the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to protest Israel's war
*  on Gaza.
*  Massive protests have fueled the streets of Yemen since the foreign attack started, and
*  after the U.S. recently re-designated the Houthi movement as a terrorist group.
*  This is journalist and activist Isa Al-Sayani.
*  We say to the United States that this classification will not cause the Yemeni people any fears
*  regarding their support of Gaza.
*  This classification is an evasion and cover-up by the United States and Israel for the crimes
*  they committed against the Palestinian people.
*  Later in the United States, the Service Employees International Union, SEIU, has become the
*  largest U.S. union to call for an immediate Gaza ceasefire.
*  Union President Mary K. Henry said, quote, SEIU's almost two million members believe
*  that wherever violence, fear and hatred thrive, working people cannot, she said, adding Israel
*  must also, quote, end decades of occupation, blockades and lack of freedom endured by the
*  Palestinian people.
*  The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to your case brought against the organization U.S.
*  Campaign for Palestinian Rights.
*  The decision upholds lower court rulings that rejected baseless claims the Palestinian Advocacy
*  Group provides material support for terrorism.
*  The Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents the group, welcomed the Supreme
*  Court move and said, quote, As the government of Israel is carrying out an unfolding genocide
*  against Palestinians in Gaza, it's more important than ever that activists be free
*  to speak out without fear, CCR said.
*  In more Supreme Court news, justices agreed Monday to hear an appeal from Oklahoma death
*  row prisoner Richard Glossop.
*  He's maintained his innocence for over a quarter of a century after being convicted
*  as the mastermind behind the 1997 murder-for-hire of his former employer, the owner of a motel
*  Glossop managed.
*  He's narrowly escaped execution three times.
*  Oklahoma's Republican Attorney General Gantner Drummond has said Glossop's conviction
*  should be vacated due to an unfair trial.
*  In immigration news, the Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration, allowing border
*  patrol agents to cut down razor wire put up by Texas troopers along its border with Mexico.
*  Texas Governor Greg Abbott had previously ignored the orders to remove the wire, asserting
*  state authority over the border area.
*  New Hampshire voters are casting ballots today in the first primary of the 2024 presidential
*  election.
*  Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley appeared at a flurry of campaign events Monday
*  in what analysts say could be a final attempt to shore up her campaign against frontrunner
*  Donald Trump.
*  On the Democratic side, President Biden will not be on the primary ballot after state Democrats
*  won ahead with January primaries despite the DNC switching up the voting calendar to prevent
*  Iowa and New Hampshire, two of the whitest states in the country, from being the first
*  to hold their primaries and caucuses.
*  A writing campaign for Biden still seeks to deliver the president to victory in New Hampshire.
*  Meanwhile, organizers are urging Democrats to instead write in their vote as ceasefire
*  to send a message to Biden over support for Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  One presidential candidate who is on New Hampshire's Democratic ticket is author and activist Marian
*  She'll be joining us to discuss her campaign later in the broadcast.
*  The Biden administration announced new measures to strengthen access to reproductive care
*  on the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade Monday.
*  These include making contraception more accessible and free under the Affordable Care Act and
*  ensuring hospitals provide emergency abortions nationwide.
*  Both President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris gave addresses Monday excoriating Republicans
*  for their continued attack on abortion rights as Democrats seek to harness persistent voter
*  rage over the Supreme Court's undoing of Roe v. Wade in 2022.
*  This is Vice President Harris speaking from the battleground state of Wisconsin as she
*  kicked off a national tour on abortion rights.
*  In the last 19 months, in states across our nation, extremists have proposed and passed
*  laws that criminalize doctors and punish women.
*  Today in America, one in three women of reproductive age live in a state with an abortion ban.
*  One in three.
*  In France, tens of thousands of people took to the streets and cities across the country
*  on Sunday, urging President Emmanuel Macron to reject a hardline immigration bill.
*  The measure strengthens deportation authority, makes it more difficult for noncitizens to
*  access social welfare and other benefits.
*  The legislation has been widely condemned as anti-immigrant amid fears of a turn to
*  the far right.
*  This is a migrant worker from Mali at the rally in Paris.
*  Myself, for example, I work.
*  I don't have social security or anything at all, even though I pay taxes.
*  This is really difficult.
*  When we work, we can be maltreated because we're afraid to lose the jobs that we have.
*  And then, when we work, the overtime hours that we do can go unpaid.
*  And we can't complain.
*  You complain, you get fired.
*  In Illinois, at least eight people were found fatally shot at three separate locations in
*  the city of Joliet Sunday and Monday.
*  The suspected gunman fled to Texas, where police said he shot himself after a confrontation
*  with law enforcement Monday evening.
*  The victim was a 28-year-old Nigerian immigrant who had been living in the U.S. for about
*  three years.
*  There's been at least two dozen mass shootings in the U.S. just in the first three weeks
*  of this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
*  Dexter Scott King, the youngest son of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King,
*  has died of prostate cancer at 62.
*  He served as chair of the King Center, where he dedicated his life's work to preserving
*  and sharing the legacy of his parents, inspiring young people to continue working toward justice
*  and equality.
*  And in California, faculty at Cal State University, the country's largest public university
*  system, are returning to the classroom today as they reach a tentative agreement late Monday
*  after just a one-day strike.
*  The deal grants pay raises and extended parental leave, among other things.
*  The California Faculty Association Union celebrated the deal, posting on social media, quote,
*  In case anyone forgot, strikes work.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
