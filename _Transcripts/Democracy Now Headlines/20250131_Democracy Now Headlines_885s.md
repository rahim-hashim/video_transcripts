During the second day of confirmation hearings for Trump's secretary of health and human services, nominee Robert F. Kennedy was questioned about his role in a deadly measles outbreak in Samoa in 2019. Dr. Alec Ekeroma, the director general of Samoa's Health Ministry, says Kennedy promoted anti-vaccine misinformation in the country, leading to the deaths of 83 people, the majority of whom were young children. Kennedy "is the preeminent anti-vax campaigner in the world" and has "no medical or scientific qualifications at all," adds investigative journalist Brian Deer,  who debunked disgraced ex-doctor Andrew Wakefield's fraudulent claims that vaccines were linked to autism. Deer says that Wakefield and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are major leaders of the anti-vaccine movement. "They basically run this movement together," he says.

# Samoa's Health Chief Says RFK Jr. Spread Anti-Vax Misinformation Before Deadly Measles Outbreak
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=2.92s)]
*  We turn now to several confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill for President Trump's cabinet [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=4.0s)]
*  members, beginning with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who faced a second day of hearings for [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=8.48s)]
*  health secretary. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=13.6s)]
*  Kennedy has previously campaigned as pro-choice, but during the hearing, he repeatedly said [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=15.16s)]
*  he believes, quote, every abortion is a tragedy and vowed to implement Trump's policies. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=19.28s)]
*  He also gave incorrect information about Medicare and Medicaid. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=24.12s)]
*  But his long record of vaccine skepticism was a major focus. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=27.8s)]
*  He repeatedly refused to disavow the debunked link between vaccines and autism and refused [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=32.0s)]
*  to acknowledge COVID vaccines are lifesaving. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=38.36s)]
*  But he ended with this claim. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=41.52s)]
*  Before I conclude, I want to make sure this committee is clear about a few things. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=43.24s)]
*  News reports and many in the hearing yesterday have claimed that I'm anti-vaccine and anti-industry. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=49.52s)]
*  Well, I'm neither. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=54.72s)]
*  I'm pro-safety. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=57.12s)]
*  I'm pro-good science. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=58.6s)]
*  I worked for 40 years to raise awareness about mercury and other toxics and fish, and nobody [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  called me anti-fish. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=67.84s)]
*  All my kids are vaccinated. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=70.16s)]
*  I believe vaccines have saved millions of lives and play a critical role in healthcare. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=71.8s)]
*  In the same hearing on Thursday, Kennedy defended his trip to Samoa in June of 2019, four months [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=78.32s)]
*  before a measles outbreak was declared that killed 83 people, mostly children. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=84.72s)]
*  Kennedy's anti-vaccine nonprofit Children's Health Defense offered to finance the trip. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=89.84s)]
*  This is Democratic Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts questioning Kennedy about that trip. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=94.44s)]
*  So, let me just follow through now, 2019. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=99.44s)]
*  So now in October of 2019, the CDC declared a measles outbreak in Samoa. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=103.08s)]
*  And in November, Samoa started a mass vaccination campaign to stop the outbreak. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=109.92s)]
*  That same month, November of 2019, after 16 people had already died from the outbreak [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  and Samoa was trying to respond to the crisis, you sent a letter to the Prime Minister of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=123.0s)]
*  Samoa stating that, quote, it is a regrettable possibility that these children are causalities [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=128.64s)]
*  of the vaccine. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  By unanimous consent, I will introduce that letter into the record. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=137.68s)]
*  Without objection. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=140.72s)]
*  So as Samoa was trying to contain the outbreak, you were saying that it was the fault of the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=141.72s)]
*  vaccine rather than the absence of vaccinations that caused the outbreak in Samoa in the same [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=148.8s)]
*  year you visited Samoa. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=156.24s)]
*  And I replied to that, Senator. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=157.96s)]
*  Let me just finish. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=159.96s)]
*  in Samoa grew to 83. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=161.96s)]
*  And ultimately, volunteers in New Zealand sent tiny coffins to help bury the dozens [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=166.16s)]
*  of children who died. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=171.32s)]
*  And the Samoan director general of health later said, with his last name and the status [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=173.24s)]
*  attached to it, people will believe him. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=181.16s)]
*  People will believe Robert Kennedy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=185.28s)]
*  So that was Senator Markey. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=188.12s)]
*  This week, Samoa's prime minister criticized RFK Jr.'s vaccine views and said she's surprised [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  by his nomination for health secretary. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=194.76s)]
*  For more, we're joined by two guests. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=198.11999999999998s)]
*  We're going to begin in Apia, the capital of Samoa. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=199.76s)]
*  We'll begin with Ione Dr. Alec Ekadoma, who is the current director general of health [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=203.27999999999997s)]
*  for Samoa's health ministry. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=210.11999999999998s)]
*  Doctor, welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=212.2s)]
*  Thanks for joining us from Samoa. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  Can you explain, for two days we've heard about Samoa, explain exactly what happened [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=216.36s)]
*  in 2019? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=222.28s)]
*  Thank you very much for the opportunity. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=226.08s)]
*  In 2019, Samoa had a very low vaccination rate. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  And that was because of some problems back in 2018 with the mixing of vaccines that resulted [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=233.0s)]
*  in two deaths. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=238.8s)]
*  And so, therefore, we had a low vaccination rate already. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  And then, Kennedy visited before the measles outbreak. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=244.6s)]
*  Now, the measles outbreak, of course, it came from New Zealand across the islands. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=250.2s)]
*  And because of a low vaccination rate, it just took off. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  And so, resulting in so many deaths. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=259.48s)]
*  But the government responded quickly and mounted a vaccine campaign, vaccination campaign. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  There was an international assistance to Samoa from all countries in the world who came across, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=271.44s)]
*  doctors and nurses came across to Samoa to help with the mass vaccination of our people. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=276.52000000000004s)]
*  So that drove the vaccination rate up to 90% within a few months. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=281.88s)]
*  So Kennedy's presence in Samoa a few months before that actually emboldened the anti-vaxxers [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=286.8s)]
*  locally and also from New Zealand. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=294.48s)]
*  And so, they were the ones, really, that tried to sow the vaccine histincy in the country. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=297.88s)]
*  But fortunately, our leaders did not believe that and mounted this emergency and mass vaccination [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=303.6s)]
*  campaign. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=310.92s)]
*  Why did Kennedy go to Samoa? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=311.92s)]
*  Apparently, he came to talk about some database that they could create. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  But when he was here, he talked to, well, he talked to the then-Director General of Health [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=324.76s)]
*  and to the Prime Minister. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=331.52s)]
*  But he also talked to local anti-vaxxers as well. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=332.64s)]
*  So I'm not privy to what was discussed, but the result of his visit didn't result in any [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=336.64s)]
*  improvements in our ICT or software capabilities in the country. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=347.88s)]
*  None was promised. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  I want to bring our other guest into this conversation. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  As we talk to the health director in Samoa, I also want to bring Brian Deer in, who was [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=360.88s)]
*  there in 2018—in 2019 in the midst of the measles outbreak. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=367.12s)]
*  He's an investigative journalist and author of The Doctor Who Fooled the World, his recent [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=373.12s)]
*  New York Times opinion piece. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  I'll never forget what Kennedy did during Samoa's measles outbreak. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=378.72s)]
*  So, can you elaborate further on what Dr. Eka Doma is saying? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=382.96s)]
*  Good morning, Amy. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=389.2s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=391.24s)]
*  I was out in Samoa at the time, and I spent a great deal of my time there speaking to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=392.24s)]
*  the mothers of children who died from measles. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=397.04s)]
*  And it was a most emotional experience. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=400.4s)]
*  And I ended my time there just crying as I became overcome by the pain of these mothers. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=403.24s)]
*  83 people died, overwhelmingly small children. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=412.24s)]
*  Now, Mr. Kennedy thinks he knows better than anybody else. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=416.32s)]
*  He claims that he's not an anti-vaccine. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=420.8s)]
*  I've been following what is now called the anti-vaccine movement for 25 years, and I [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=424.56s)]
*  can assure you that Mr. Kennedy is not only an anti-vaccine campaigner, he is the preeminent [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=429.6s)]
*  anti-vaccine campaigner in the world. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=436.08s)]
*  He went to Samoa, and after the outbreak began, he then wrote to the Prime Minister trying [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=439.52s)]
*  to suggest that it wasn't in fact a virus at all that was killing these children, but [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  was in fact the responsibility of the vaccine itself. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=450.0s)]
*  And he didn't stop there. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=454.0s)]
*  Even this week, speaking to senators, he claimed that nobody knows what these children died from, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=455.68s)]
*  even though the vaccine there had collapsed as a result of other issues. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=463.28s)]
*  And then after a vaccination campaign that followed the outbreak or occurred at the same [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=474.0s)]
*  time as the outbreak, the children stopped dying. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=480.48s)]
*  But Mr. Kennedy felt that he should tell senators that nobody [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=483.52s)]
*  knows what killed those children. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=488.0s)]
*  Extraordinary thing for him to say. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=489.84s)]
*  What do you think, Brian Deer—and then I want to ask the health minister in Samoa—of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  him being the health secretary, the secretary of Health and Human Services of the United States? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, I have to say, listening to him over the last couple of days, Amy, that I was shocked [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=508.64s)]
*  by the attitude he displayed. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=514.56s)]
*  He was making it absolutely clear that notwithstanding him being the—hoping to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=516.96s)]
*  become the head of an agency with a $2,000 billion budget and employing 90,000 people, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=523.12s)]
*  he was going to personally involve himself in vaccine science. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=530.64s)]
*  And it would be he who would be deciding whether the research was conducted properly, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=535.04s)]
*  even though he has no medical or scientific qualifications at all, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=540.88s)]
*  and not the enormous staff he represents and the agencies that have actually written to him [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=544.56s)]
*  previously telling him that the research overwhelmingly and conclusively shows that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=550.7199999999999s)]
*  there is no link between vaccines and, for example, autism. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=557.3599999999999s)]
*  He was making it absolutely clear to senators that he was going to, in that job, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  with those enormous responsibilities for that massive entity, he was going to involve himself [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=566.64s)]
*  in individual pieces of research and deciding for himself whether vaccines, for example, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=572.32s)]
*  cause autism. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=578.08s)]
*  And before we leave Samoa, Dr. Alec Ekodoma, if you can talk about the significance of—if [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=579.12s)]
*  he is confirmed as health secretary here in the U.S.? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  It is quite significant. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=592.0s)]
*  Someone who is prominent in the world with a large halo spitting out anti-vaccine sentiments, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=593.6s)]
*  emboldening anti-vaxxers around the world and in Samoa is going to be a public health disaster for [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=604.96s)]
*  us. Already, we're going to have reduction in U.S. funding to United Nations and to WHO. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=612.5600000000001s)]
*  That is going to affect our capability here. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=620.08s)]
*  And then you add in public Kennedy into this role, that it's going to slow down the flow [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=622.64s)]
*  of vaccines to us, that it's going to harm our public health states in this country. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  And so, therefore, it will be a disaster for us. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=635.68s)]
*  Well, I want to thank you, Dr. Alec Ekodoma, for joining us, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=639.6s)]
*  director general of Health for Samoa's Health Ministry. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=644.64s)]
*  Brian Deer, I want to move on to another issue. You wrote the book The Doctor Who Fooled the World. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=648.4000000000001s)]
*  I want to go right now to another interaction in the Senate, another exchange. This is independent [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=658.0s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders questioning RFK Jr. Thursday alongside Senator Bill Cassidy, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=666.1600000000001s)]
*  physician and key Republican vote. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=674.0s)]
*  I find myself in the unusual and uncomfortable position of having to agree with Senator Cassidy's [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=676.48s)]
*  line of questioning. Mr. Kennedy, in an interview in July 2023, you stated, quote, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=685.36s)]
*  I do believe autism does come from vaccines. And you have the end of quote, and you have praised [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=696.32s)]
*  a gentleman named Andrew Wakefield for his research. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=704.0s)]
*  What studies, you talk about the need to be science based, get our information, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=711.12s)]
*  good information to make decisions. What studies have you utilized to come to the inclusion [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=716.08s)]
*  that vaccines cause autism? I'm happy to sit down with you. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=724.0s)]
*  No, no, please just answer me that. I mean, look at the Mawson study, Senator. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=727.5200000000001s)]
*  The what? Yeah. Just look at that study. Yeah, I will. And that was published. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=732.0s)]
*  But I don't, you know, I don't want to, I wouldn't rest on a single study. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=736.4s)]
*  Right. All studies can be better. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=740.56s)]
*  Okay. Don't mean to be rude. I don't have a lot of time. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=742.32s)]
*  Just saying. You would not be, I just heard you say you would not, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=744.72s)]
*  could not be happier if you were proved wrong. Mr. Chairman, I asked to put into the record [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=748.0s)]
*  16 studies done by scientists and doctors all over the world saying that vaccines do not cause [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=755.12s)]
*  autism. So in the last few minutes we have, Brian Deer, you wrote the book, The Doctor Who Fooled [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=764.48s)]
*  the World. You were talking about Dr. Andrew Wakefield. If you can comment on what's the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=771.44s)]
*  connection between Robert Kennedy and Dr. Andrew Wakefield, known as the father of the anti-vaccine [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=779.12s)]
*  movement. Well, they basically run this movement together. Kennedy, Andrew Wakefield and another [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=786.16s)]
*  man, Del Bigtree, who works with them both, are, if you like, the innermost circle of this movement, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=793.1999999999999s)]
*  which has evolved in recent years. Andrew Wakefield is a research cheat. He was responsible for a [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=798.7199999999999s)]
*  fraudulent study published in London in 1998 that was referred to by another senator yesterday, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=804.96s)]
*  Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire. And she broke down as she was trying to explain that she has a [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=811.76s)]
*  developmentally challenged son and that she had blamed herself or had agonized over whether she [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=818.8000000000001s)]
*  should blame herself for having vaccinated her son and whether it was something she had done that [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=826.8000000000001s)]
*  caused his disability. And she was breaking down there even during the hearing as she was trying [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=832.0s)]
*  to get her words out. The suffering that parents have been exposed to as a result of this man, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=837.28s)]
*  Andrew Wakefield in particular, and his research paper that she was referring to and Bernie Saunders, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=842.56s)]
*  which was referring to, published in London in 1998. And I would say was the honour of my life [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=848.48s)]
*  to have caused to be retracted and exposed for what it was. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=856.16s)]
*  Brian Deere, I want to thank you for being with us, investigative journalist, author of The Doctor, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=861.76s)]
*  Who Fooled the World. We'll link to your New York Times op-ed. I'll never forget what Kennedy did [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=865.92s)]
*  during Samoa's measles outbreak. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn9mPgFrAh4&t=870.9599999999999s)]
