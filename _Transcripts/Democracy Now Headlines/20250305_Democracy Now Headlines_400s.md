President Trump on Tuesday once again focused on the importance of securing the U.S. border and criticized former President Biden's so-called open border policies. He accused Biden of allowing migrants to "overwhelm" towns like Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio, and pushed for even more funding to implement his campaign promise of mass deportations. The Trump administration is "doubling down on creating this image that immigrants are to blame for every single one of their problems," says longtime immigrant rights activist Erika Andiola.

*  The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=71.56s)]

*  The cartels are waging war on America, and it's time for America to wage war on the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=89.08s)]
*  cartels, which we are doing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=94.26s)]
*  For more, we're joined now from Phoenix, Arizona, a border state with Mexico. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=97.34s)]
*  By longtime immigration activist Erika Andiola, she was the press secretary for Latino Outreach [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=103.84s)]
*  for the Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign, and she has a recent op-ed piece in the Arizona [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=108.8s)]
*  Republic headline, Deporting Immigrants Like Me Won't Make Eggs Cheaper or Your Family [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  Safe. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=122.16s)]
*  Erika, respond to what you heard Trump say last night. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=123.16s)]
*  Yeah, nothing new. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  It's the same type of strategy, right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=129.08s)]
*  You pick this marginalized group, in this case the immigrant community, and you double [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=131.84s)]
*  down on ensuring that the American people create this image, right, that immigrants [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=136.62s)]
*  are really the villains, the ones that are taking your jobs, that are stealing your wages, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=143.08s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  And the reality is that that is false. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  We know that the majority of Americans in this country contribute greatly to the economy, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=153.04s)]
*  contribute greatly to our communities, but unfortunately it is a great way for Elon Musk [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=160.2s)]
*  to do what he's doing and keep people distracted, right, thinking that they are going to make [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=165.68s)]
*  people safer by detaining grandmothers, DACA recipients, teachers, right? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=172.64s)]
*  And that reality is far from the truth. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  So there's nothing new that he said, but he is doubling down on creating this image for [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=183.32s)]
*  the American people that immigrants are to blame for every single one of their problems [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=190.16s)]
*  when we know who are really the ones who are slashing Medicaid and trying to get rid of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  Social Security for the American people. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  And Erica, could you talk about the latest month and a half of the mass deportation program [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=204.12s)]
*  that's been occurring? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=209.96s)]
*  The number of arrests supposedly have leveled off, but the number, and deportations are [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=211.8s)]
*  actually, according to the government's own stats, fewer right now than they were under [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=218.32s)]
*  the Biden administration, but there's a huge increase in the number of people in detention. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=224.32s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=230.76s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=232.32s)]
*  That's the plan, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=233.32s)]
*  You have corporations that literally own these detention centers who have lobbied for years, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=235.64s)]
*  for decades really, who have lobbied to ensure that we have more and more immigrants detained [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=243.72s)]
*  so that they can continue to profit out of our people. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  So I'm not surprised that there is more demand from the Trump administration to ICE to continue [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=253.4s)]
*  to detain people, but the fact is that our people are ending up in detention centers, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=261.12s)]
*  detention camps. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=266.64s)]
*  And the reality is that the actual number of people who are in these detention centers, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=268.48s)]
*  people who are getting arrested and placing the deportation proceedings, the majority [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=275.12s)]
*  of them don't even have any criminal record, and some who do are actually people who just [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  returned to the country after being deported, maybe to see their families again, what you [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=285.32s)]
*  call a reentry, right? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=290.84s)]
*  Which it's also labeled as a criminal conviction. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=292.28s)]
*  So what I'm trying to say is that the majority of our people who are detained right now, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  who are being arrested, are not necessarily the people who Trump was speaking about last [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=301.4s)]
*  night, the rapists, whatever he says every single time. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=306.59999999999997s)]
*  So he paints this picture to make sure the Americans believe that those who are being [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=311.44s)]
*  arrested are really those who are posing a threat to the American people. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  But that's farther, that's really far from the truth of what I'm seeing, what I'm hearing [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=323.44s)]
*  from other organizations who are hearing, who are getting the calls from the American [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=328.0s)]
*  community, who are getting picked up for doing nothing, for maybe driving or just being in [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=331.56s)]
*  the wrong place at the wrong time. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=336.8s)]
*  I mean, I just heard the story of a Guatemalan American who was driving between two New York [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  cities, right outside of New York City. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  She was pulled over by ICE. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=346.98s)]
*  She was asked for her ID. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=349.88s)]
*  She showed her driver's license. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  She already has started to carry her passport. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=352.54s)]
*  And then they said, we want another federal ID. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=355.8s)]
*  She showed her passport, and they said, we're not letting go of you until you tell us where [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=358.12s)]
*  you illegally got this passport, a totally legal ID. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=362.76s)]
*  And they held her for hours on the side of the cold road. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=366.64s)]
*  As she saw person after person pulled aside, she said it was very clear they were people [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=369.84s)]
*  of color. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=373.64s)]
*  Three people were taken into a van and handcuffed until they finally released her. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=374.64s)]
*  Erika Andiola, I want to thank you for being with us. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  Longtime immigration activist. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=384.12s)]
*  We're going to link to that piece you wrote, Deporting Immigrants Like Me Won't Make [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAOMa3G7OY4&t=385.44s)]
