We go to Gaza for a report on the brutal conditions of Israel's genocide of Palestinians from Abubaker Abed, a 22-year-old journalist who has recently been diagnosed with malnutrition as a result of Israel's total siege of the Gaza Strip. "It's unending misery," says Abed. "We're here stranded. We're seeing the systematic killing of everyone, as Israel is targeting every single one here in Gaza." In the week since Israel's abrupt desertion of its ceasefire agreement, says Abed, the total suffering in Gaza "is much worse than ever before." He pleads for international intervention and accountability. "As long as the world allows Israel to do so, this will not stop."

# "Unending Misery": Journalist Abubaker Abed Reports from Gaza as Israel Weighs Broader Invasion
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA)
*  It looks like we just got Abu Bakr Abed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=0.0s)]
*  He is in Dara'a Balaah. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  He is under siege right now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=5.72s)]
*  Abu Bakr, can you tell us how you are right now? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  We have just reported on the killing of your colleagues, the Israeli military airstrikes [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  that killed your colleagues, Mohammed Mansour, as well as Hussam Shabat. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=18.319999999999997s)]
*  Your thoughts right now? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=31.08s)]
*  I think there are no specific thoughts to tell you, but it's unending misery, something [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  that we can't really imagine. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=47.2s)]
*  It's taking a very heavy toll on every single one here, particularly the children. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=49.720000000000006s)]
*  We're here stranded. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=55.68000000000001s)]
*  We're seeing the systematic killing of everyone as Israel is targeting every single one here [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=56.68000000000001s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  We're seeing assassinations of journalists, medical staffers, and ordinary people. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=64.44s)]
*  So Israel does not spare anyone in its attacks. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=71.36s)]
*  We are hoping, people, to hope after the killing of more than 700 people in the past seven [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=75.88s)]
*  days that this will stop because I've been talking to people outside and they are very [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=80.60000000000001s)]
*  desperate for an end to this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  People are now talking about that we want an end to this genocide. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=90.2s)]
*  We don't need anything more. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  That's what they need because they cannot really keep grieving more people. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=97.08s)]
*  They cannot really keep grieving the losses of their loved ones, the losses of their entire [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=101.64s)]
*  families. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=106.52s)]
*  That's why when we talk about this particular issue, people don't know what to do. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=107.64s)]
*  It's an indescribable feeling that they are being killed every single day, that they are [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=113.04s)]
*  being killed every single moment, and that we are in to siege for more than 20 days. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=117.08s)]
*  There's no food available. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=123.36s)]
*  A lot of people are being taken to the hospital to receive treatment where doctors cannot [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=124.36s)]
*  really give the proper treatment for them. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=130.16000000000003s)]
*  And the medications are not available. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=132.8s)]
*  Israel has been blocking the two crossings, not allowing a trickle, one single track into [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=141.52s)]
*  And that has really left people on the cusp of imminent death. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=142.8s)]
*  So we are talking about that we are facing death in every single direction, from the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  starvation, from the relentless bombardments, and from the conditions that we are living [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  under. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=158.56s)]
*  It's a very, very horrific situation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=160.04s)]
*  And how, Abu Bakr, are you personally feeling? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=162.04s)]
*  Meaning you're physically, you're ailments right now? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=168.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=173.08s)]
*  For me, like, yeah, I've been diagnosed with malnutrition. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=174.08s)]
*  I know that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=182.36s)]
*  I'm trying to recover with no means at all. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=183.76s)]
*  I'm trying to have a way through this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=189.16s)]
*  But unfortunately, there is no help at all coming from outside or coming from inside [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  because I'm helpless towards myself. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=199.6s)]
*  My family is helpless towards me. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=202.6s)]
*  The doctors around me are also helpless because there is nothing that I can really opt for [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=205.0s)]
*  so I can really help myself recover from the trauma, from the illness that I have. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=211.64s)]
*  And that's not all of me because I've been seeing around me many of the children who [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=217.12s)]
*  are malnutrition or are desperate for food and desperate for everything because even [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=220.24s)]
*  the free food that people have been receiving is no longer available. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=225.16s)]
*  And the same here. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=229.28s)]
*  We're talking about that there's a scarcity of every food stable inside the territory, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  like vegetables, like fruits, and those much, much needed food stables for the population. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  So how can people really cope with such an incredibly dire situation that people don't [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=241.6s)]
*  have anything that people do just have just now resorted to canned food? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=246.96s)]
*  Canned food is not helpful for us. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=253.12s)]
*  Canned food is a very, very bad equality. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=255.12s)]
*  And that's what Israel has been doing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=258.64s)]
*  So as long as Israel, the word allows Israel to do so, this will not stop. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=260.36s)]
*  We need more people to come out in the states to close the routes and to go on global strikes [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=265.68s)]
*  to make sure that this can be lifted, that this blockade and this aggression can be stopped [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=271.64s)]
*  Other than that, all that you will see is just more mass murders of Palestinians. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=276.68s)]
*  And all that you will see is more suffering and more painful memories and pictures that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=282.32s)]
*  you have been keep watching for the past 17 months. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=287.0s)]
*  And that's now faced with the genocide. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=290.08s)]
*  So nothing like no one in Gaza feels safe anymore. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=292.56s)]
*  No one in Gaza realizes what they are doing through because what they are doing through [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=296.36s)]
*  is now going beyond hellish because this time of the genocide, the seven days that we have [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=300.96s)]
*  been living through is a much, much bigger scale of killing, of bombardment than we [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=305.64s)]
*  have lived ever before during the past 15 months face one of the genocides. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=311.52s)]
*  So we didn't know really what to do. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=316.32s)]
*  We didn't know how we can really cope with such an incredibly difficult situation and [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=318.32s)]
*  under the most atrocious conditions that no one can really imagine. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=323.96s)]
*  Abu Bakr, the latest news. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  The United Nations announced it would reduce its presence in Gaza by withdrawing about [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=331.92s)]
*  a third of its international workers there following repeated strikes on its facilities [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=336.2s)]
*  by Israel. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  We're talking about doctors and nurses, humanitarian aid workers. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  At the same time, Israel is now putting forward that they may reinvade Gaza with something [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=348.32s)]
*  like 50,000 soldiers. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=354.28s)]
*  We have one minute for your response. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=356.88s)]
*  I don't know what to say. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=360.24s)]
*  I know what to say. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=372.6s)]
*  I know like how long how long the world will keep watching. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=373.6s)]
*  I don't know what the world wants. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=378.64s)]
*  What the world wants to see in Gaza happen so they can really move in that and stop what [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=381.2s)]
*  the hell inflicted upon every single one. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  Half of the population are children. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=389.91999999999996s)]
*  They have nothing to do with this war. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=392.64s)]
*  Most of the population have been have been going through or have had tragedies because [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=394.96s)]
*  of this genocide. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=401.68s)]
*  Literally every single one in Gaza has lost loved one has lost a family member. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=402.68s)]
*  The houses are destroyed. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=408.47999999999996s)]
*  Everything is in Gaza. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=410.96s)]
*  I don't know why the military wants to conduct another military campaign inside Gaza because [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=411.96s)]
*  there's nothing to be destroyed at all. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=420.24s)]
*  I can't really put it into words, but it's very simple that nothing can be salvaged. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=422.24s)]
*  We want to thank you so much for being with us. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=428.24s)]
*  A Palestinian journalist, 22 years old, speaking to us from Deir al-Bala in Gaza, has been [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoySTUrjXYA&t=432.32s)]
