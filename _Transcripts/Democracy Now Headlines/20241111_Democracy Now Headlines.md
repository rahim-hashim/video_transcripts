*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, War, Peace and the Presidency.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  President-elect Donald Trump has picked Thomas Homan to serve as his so-called border czar.
*  Homan served as acting director of ICE—that's Immigration and Customs Enforcement—during
*  the first Trump administration.
*  He's backed Trump's plans to deport as many as 20 million immigrants.
*  During a recent interview on 60 Minutes, Homan said the mass deportation campaign could also
*  target U.S.-born children who were born to undocumented parents.
*  He was interviewed by Cecilia Vega.
*  We have seen one estimate that says it would cost $88 billion to deport a million people
*  a year.

*  Three senators are in the running, Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Senator John Cornyn
*  of Texas, known as the Johns, and Senator Rick Scott of Florida.
*  On Sunday, Trump said the next majority leader must embrace recess appointments to make it
*  easier for him to quickly fill posts without Senate oversight.
*  For years, both Republicans and Democrats have opposed this move.
*  Sources close to liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor say she has no intention to

*  with anyone.
*  This strike targeted civilians who have no ties to any groups or organizations.
*  More than 50 people were there as their grandchildren, children and daughters, all displaced, had

*  souls, and I'm still working actively.
*  I found it all destroyed.
*  I don't have in it any missiles to attack the Israelis.
*  The enemy is a butcher with no pity nor mercy at all, even for children.

*  Ahead of the summit, the group Global Witness released covert recordings of Azerbaijan's
*  COP29 chief executive, Eleonora Sultanov, promoting possible fossil fuel deals with
*  someone posing as an investor.
*  The fake investor told Sultanov they were considering sponsoring COP29 in exchange for
*  deals with Azerbaijan's state energy firm, Socar.
*  This is Sultanov.
*  As I said, we have a lot of pipeline infrastructure.
*  We have a lot of gas fields that are to be developed.
*  We have a lot of green projects that Socar is very interested in.
*  There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established, potential joint ventures.
*  Our Socar trading is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.
