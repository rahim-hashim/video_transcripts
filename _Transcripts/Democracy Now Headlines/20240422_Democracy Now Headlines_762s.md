*  Israel and Taiwan.
*  The House also approved a bill that could lead to a ban on the social media app TikTok.

*  The Ukraine bill passed by a vote of 311 to 112.
*  Every Democrat who voted supported the measure.

*  All of us have seen the tragedy of Gaza.
*  We have seen how Prime Minister Netanyahu's government has used American weapons to kill
*  indiscriminately, to force famine.
*  Over 25,000 women and children dead, tens of thousands of missiles and bombs levied
*  on innocent civilians.
*  We cannot escape what we see before us every day.
*  Are we going to participate in that carnage or not?
*  I choose not to.
*  In Gaza, Palestinian civil defense workers have found at least 210 bodies buried in a
*  mass grave in the courtyard of the Nasser Medical Complex in the southern Gaza city
*  of Qanyunas.
*  The discovery comes two weeks after Israeli forces withdrew from the hospital.
*  Al Jazeera reports many of the bodies found included children, young men and older women.
*  Some reportedly had their hands tied behind their backs.
*  Palestinians have been searching the hospital grounds for bodies of loved ones killed during
*  the Israeli siege.

*  and delivered her child.
*  Dr. Mohammed Salama is the head of the neonatal intensive care unit at Al-Emirati Hospital
*  in Raqqa.
*  The baby girl came out in a tragic situation.
*  She came out and found herself an orphan directly, came into life without care.
*  As soon as she came, she had a moderate to severe respiratory distress.
*  The name that came out was Baby of a Martyr, and this in itself a hard word, a tragic word.
*  Even as we write this label, our hands tremble.
*  The thing is hard.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Palestinians staged a general strike Sunday after Israeli forces
*  killed at least 14 Palestinians during a 50-hour siege on the Norshamps refugee camp

*  Benjamin Netanyahu to follow suit.
*  Columbia University is canceled in-person classes today as campus protests over the
*  war on Gaza enter a sixth day.

*  If you have access to any communications, the government can force you to help its spy.
*  That means anybody with access to a server, a wire, a cable box, a wifi router, a phone

*  will and force them, in effect, to become what amounts to an agent for Big Brother.
*  Opening arguments begin today in Donald Trump's criminal trial.

*  which seized power last year in a coup.
*  In labor news, Volkswagen employees at a Chattanooga, Tennessee, factory have overwhelmingly voted
*  to join the United Auto Workers Union.

*  That's how we win.
*  And they voted for a union.
