"There has been a systemic erasure of Black history." Professor Christina Greer discusses the Trump administration's crackdown on free speech and efforts to whitewash American history. The erasure of the history of racism and resistance is not only intellectually dishonest, says Greer, but will also cause the U.S. economic and social harm. "We can't move forward as a nation collectively … if we don't understand our collective past," she says.

*  Our next guest argues nothing about these efforts to whitewash American history, nor [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=67.74s)]
*  the Trump administration's expanding crackdown on dissent and immigration, should be surprising [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=73.32s)]

*  She writes, quote, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=88.32s)]
*  It's frightening and disappointing, but not surprising if one knows anything about [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=89.32s)]
*  the black experience in America, unquote. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=94.16s)]
*  Christina Greer, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=97.96s)]
*  You wrote the book How to Build a Democracy from Fannie Lou Hamer and Barbara Jordan to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=100.83999999999999s)]
*  Stacey Abrams, as well as the book Black Ethnics, Race Immigration and the Pursuit of the American [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=105.08s)]
*  Dream. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  Welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  Why don't you take it from the title, from there? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=113.24s)]
*  Black Americans Are Not Surprised. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=117.24s)]
*  Thanks, Amy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=119.48s)]
*  Well, you know, there's just been so much hand-wringing about how could this be happening? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=120.48s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=126.08s)]
*  This isn't the country I know. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  And so many black Americans are like, this is absolutely the country we know. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=129.12s)]
*  This is a country that's made a lot of progress over the decades, the centuries. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=132.84s)]
*  But there's always progress and regress in this nation. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=138.16s)]
*  And so if we think about post-Civil War reconstruction and the great progress that we made, and we [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=141.24s)]
*  had elected officials, black elected officials, even in the South, and then that was a very [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  short-lived experiment. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=151.16s)]
*  And we had decades of brutality in Jim Crow, military, black military officers being lynched [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=153.16s)]
*  in their uniforms, you know, redlining the refusal to include black women in many of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=158.84s)]
*  Therefore, the lack of generational wealth that was able to be passed down because of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=166.0s)]
*  black domestic workers, you know, people being fired. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=170.0s)]
*  You know, we always joke, good times, the TV show, the Norman Lear TV show with John [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=172.68s)]
*  Amos, you know, his famous tagline is, you know, Florida was last hired and first fired. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=177.4s)]
*  These are all things that black Americans are fully aware of. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=182.36s)]
*  Nothing that's happening right now is a shock. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=186.84s)]
*  It's just a shock to so many white people, because it's never happened to them. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=190.0s)]
*  But what we're seeing, sadly, happen in the 21st century, so many of our parents and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=193.6s)]
*  grandparents have told us these stories. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=198.88s)]
*  My parents, who are very young and hip and travel together, they went to segregated schools. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=201.56s)]
*  My father integrated his high school in Miami. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=206.48s)]
*  My mother never went to integrated schools a day in her life, you know, and these are [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=209.28s)]
*  people who are still walking among us. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=213.68s)]
*  Ruby Bridges isn't even 70 years old. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=216.56s)]
*  So many people have no idea who Ruby Bridges even is, right, the little black girl who [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=218.84s)]
*  integrated Louisiana public schools. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=223.08s)]
*  And there's been a systemic erasure of black history consistently, book bannings consistently. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=225.28s)]
*  So as I write in the piece, you know, we kind of jump from slavery and Harriet Tubman and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=230.48s)]
*  Frederick Douglass to all of a sudden civil rights. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=234.12s)]
*  We jump over 100 years to Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=235.96s)]
*  And then all of a sudden we jump a few more decades to a post-racial Barack Obama. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=239.12s)]
*  But there's a really, really brutal and bloody and dark history of black people in this country [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=243.24s)]
*  at the hands of white people, not all white people, but at the hands of enough white people [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=250.52s)]
*  to push us into a really hard conversation that we've refused to have as a nation. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=255.32s)]
*  And because of that, so many people are hand-wringing and head-scratching at this particular moment. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=260.6s)]
*  And, Professor Greer, I wanted to ask you about the Trump administration's, not only [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=264.52s)]
*  the attacks on higher education over issues of diversity, equity and inclusion, but now [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=271.88s)]
*  that the U.S. Department of Education is requiring all public school systems within a few days [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=279.56s)]
*  to certify that they've done away with what the administration calls discriminatory [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=286.12s)]
*  diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Your response? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=291.32s)]
*  How is it discriminatory to know one's history? I mean, we can't move forward as a nation [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=297.64s)]
*  collectively, and that's what all my books are about, really trying to figure out how [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  do we move forward if we don't understand our collective past. White people and black people [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=306.6s)]
*  are inextricably linked in this country, not just our last names and our families, but the brutality [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=311.88s)]
*  that so many people experienced on this land. It's our shared history. Black history is American [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=317.24s)]
*  history, and to not understand it is to not fully understand this country. It's to not understand [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=323.72s)]
*  why LBJ was such a great president and helped push forward the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=328.52000000000004s)]
*  Act and the Immigration Act and the complexities of how we did that as a white southerner, to not [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=332.76s)]
*  understand this country, to not understand Eisenhower integrating the armed forces by [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=337.32s)]
*  executive order and how we've used executive orders in the past for some really amazing things, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=342.44s)]
*  the Emancipation Proclamation, integrating the armed forces, and for some really horrific things, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=347.24s)]
*  i.e. Japanese internment camps that put in Italians and Germans as well. So to not understand our [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=352.12s)]
*  shared history is to sort of meet the moment and not know where we're going, and I think that's [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=357.56s)]
*  part of the frustration that so many Americans have right now. I think that's part of the confusion [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=363.32s)]
*  that is deliberate right now. We have to have, you know, children can understand complex issues. I [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=368.12s)]
*  think anyone who's been around kids long enough, if you present them with information in a way [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  that is palatable, they get it, and it's not divisive to understand how there is U.S. chattel [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=379.72s)]
*  slavery in this country. It's not divisive to understand how we once had thousands of different [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=386.12s)]
*  Native American tribes across the nation. You know, I live in New York state. We had a robust [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=391.88s)]
*  Native American community that is no longer in many parts of the state, and so it's our shared [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=397.88s)]
*  collective identity that can help us be a great nation. And, you know, if we want to just get to [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=405.48s)]
*  brass tacks, being a diverse nation helps you make money. That's a language that some people [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=410.52s)]
*  understand, right? When you have diversity, when you have equity, when you have inclusion, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=415.64s)]
*  it's actually better for your bottom line. So I think Target is finding out how diversity, equity, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=419.64s)]
*  inclusion is better for their bottom line. I think a lot of businesses will slowly realize, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=425.08s)]
*  you know, if you don't understand the bus boycotts of Montgomery from the 1950s and 60s, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=429.47999999999996s)]
*  you know, and the boycotts in various lunch counters across the South, those were economic [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=435.4s)]
*  boycotts that had obviously other consequences. But, you know, to get racial equity, there was an [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=439.64s)]
*  economic component to so much of what brave Black Americans did in the South. And I think a lot of [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=445.48s)]
*  corporations are going to find out in the 21st century version of what those economic boycotts [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=449.8s)]
*  can look like to move forward a more equitable agenda. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=455.40000000000003s)]
*  And I wanted to ask you as well about the—you mentioned the Trump administration's [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=459.72s)]
*  targeting of especially dissident students and foreign students. For example, you are a Tufts [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=467.64000000000004s)]
*  graduate. Your response to a Tufts student, Rumeysa Ostork, who was sent to Louisiana after [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=474.44s)]
*  being driven to Vermont but was picked up by immigration agents in Somerville, Massachusetts, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=483.32s)]
*  the video that captured her arrest and detention. Your sense of what is—how universities should [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=490.44s)]
*  respond to these direct incursions of the government into their student bodies and on [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=499.64s)]
*  their campuses to seize students? Well, you know, as a university professor, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=506.12s)]
*  you know, the university is a space for intellectual ideas and debates. We cannot have a space where [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=511.56s)]
*  it's filled with fear and silence. And so to see that horrific video is frightening. I think [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=517.64s)]
*  universities have to band together. This is—what is the point of an endowment if during [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=525.08s)]
*  hard times you're not going to use it? We know that there are some universities that are larger [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=529.8000000000001s)]
*  and more powerful than others. If they stick together, collective action, which is what I [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=533.72s)]
*  talk about in all of my books, you can actually get a lot more than sort of being picked off [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=537.72s)]
*  one by one. We do know—I mean, this is, again, time and time in America, if you know your history. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=542.5200000000001s)]
*  You know, as you target one group, many groups don't ever think that they'll be targeted. And [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=547.4000000000001s)]
*  it's like, your day will come. So if you do not come together and think of a strategy, I mean, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=551.56s)]
*  as an intellectual space, we debate these ideas. This is what has made this nation actually move [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=557.7199999999999s)]
*  forward as one of the leaders in the world, for better or for worse. And so this idea that [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=562.5999999999999s)]
*  immigrants take away from the robust intellectual space is patently false, first of all, but it's [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=568.3599999999999s)]
*  creating a level of fear where, you know, what is the point of a university if we have homogeneity [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHD8kyhrSIs&t=576.44s)]
