We get an update on "the darkest hour of need" for the Burmese people, from Maung Zarni, a Burmese human rights activist, after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake hit Burma Friday, leaving at least 2,700 dead, with the death toll expected to rise as rescue efforts continue. Aid groups in the worst-hit areas of Burma, also known as Myanmar, said there was an urgent need for shelter, food and water. The country's civil war has complicated efforts to reach those injured and made homeless in the disaster, and Amnesty International says the military needs to allow aid to reach areas of the country not under its control.

*  Hello? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=40.88s)]
*  Somebody there? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=42.92s)]
*  We are stuck in here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=45.64s)]

*  I beg you, please pull us out. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=48.08s)]

*  since the 2021 military coup has complicated efforts to allow aid to reach all those affected [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=60.0s)]
*  by the quake. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=66.64s)]
*  As rebel groups accuse the junta of conducting airstrikes even after the earthquake, Amnesty [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=67.84s)]
*  International said the military junta needs to urgently allow humanitarian groups unimpeded [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  access to all areas of Burma. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=78.8s)]
*  India, Vietnam and Thailand all quickly sent rescue teams and emergency aid. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=82.2s)]
*  The Trump administration's dismantling of USAID has slowed the U.S. response. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=86.48s)]
*  A day the earthquake struck, the administration said it was firing nearly all remaining USAID [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=91.36s)]
*  personnel and closing its foreign missions. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  On Monday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce confirmed that a three-person assessment [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  team from USAID will travel to Burma this week. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=105.72s)]
*  The United States will provide up to $2 million through Burma-based humanitarian assistance [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=110.88s)]
*  organizations to support earthquake-affected communities as an immediate response to the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=116.92s)]
*  March 28 earthquake. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=122.0s)]
*  A USAID team of humanitarian experts based in the region are traveling to Burma now to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=123.88s)]
*  identify the people's most pressing needs. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=130.44s)]
*  For more, we're joined by Meng Czarny, Burmese dissident, human rights activist, scholar [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=133.6s)]
*  of genocide, co-founder of Forces of Renewal for Southeast Asia, or FORSI, a grassroots [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=139.06s)]
*  network of pro-democracy scholars and human rights activists across Southeast Asia. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=144.62s)]
*  He's from Mandalay, the epicenter of the earthquake in Burma's second-largest city. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=148.66s)]
*  Czarny, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=153.73999999999998s)]
*  Explain the situation. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=156.5s)]
*  Well, it is really a triple whammy, Amy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=157.5s)]
*  The coup came on the heel of COVID-19. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=164.66s)]
*  The country was reeling from the lack of serious health care infrastructure and massive death [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=169.57999999999998s)]
*  tolls and spread of COVID. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=177.26s)]
*  And then the coup triggered the civil war, which came on top of a low-intensity anti-Hunter [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=179.54s)]
*  resistance movement that had been going on for 60 to 70 years, depending on the ethnic [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  regions. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=193.38000000000002s)]
*  And then on top of that, in the fourth year of the civil war, we were hit by earthquake. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=194.58s)]
*  And the earthquake hit the, you know, importantly, the heartland of Burmese Buddhism majority, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=204.34s)]
*  but the dry zone, including the capital of the junta. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=213.3s)]
*  So this is really a triple whammy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=219.78s)]
*  And Czarny, how has the continuing civil war and the military checkpoints all around the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=223.94s)]
*  country affected the ability of search and rescue operations to get to people trapped under the rubble? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, three things affect negatively search and rescue missions by even the locals. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=240.9s)]
*  Number one is the infrastructural damage to freeway, highways, and local lanes that have [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=247.46s)]
*  hampered movements of, you know, the rescue teams or goods and services to the affected areas. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  Zagane and Mandalay are two major cities, and then the capital, Napier. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=263.06s)]
*  And then the second is the military junta is rightly paranoid for its survival. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=268.74s)]
*  Because it's losing massive territorial control across the country. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=276.1s)]
*  So the military junta step up obstacles, putting up obstacles for movements of people, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=283.14000000000004s)]
*  particularly at night time. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=291.46000000000004s)]
*  And then the continuing area bombardment in areas that the junta has lost control. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=293.86s)]
*  And so, you know, on top of the earthquake, the military junta is bombing, you know, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=302.5s)]
*  large villages, towns, and cities in different parts of the country. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=309.86s)]
*  And then there are also groups like Arakon Army that is also accused of committing atrocity crimes [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=315.14s)]
*  against Rohingya in western Myanmar, are taking advantage of the situation and attacking some of [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=322.34s)]
*  the junta outpost. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=330.1s)]
*  So it's a really demoralizing and very, very dark scenario we are looking at. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=332.09999999999997s)]
*  There is no state as such, you know, that there is not a single actor in Burma that can be [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=339.38s)]
*  considered representative of Myanmar as a state. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=346.02s)]
*  And, you know, the civil society has been largely very much weakened by decades of civil war, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=350.26s)]
*  political repression, massive poverty, mismanagement, corruption. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=358.66s)]
*  All of that has compounded the society's effort to come to rescue. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=363.38000000000005s)]
*  Also, you are from Mandalay, Burma's second largest city. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=371.94000000000005s)]
*  What is the situation there, the epicenter of the earthquake? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=376.26000000000005s)]
*  Well, we are about, you know, we are across the river Erawadi from the epicenter, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=381.62s)]
*  which is near another dry zone city called Zagong. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=386.58s)]
*  And people are very afraid of tremors or aftershocks. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=390.41999999999996s)]
*  And these aftershocks seem to be taking place, you know, daily and nightly. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=395.46s)]
*  So people, a lot of people are sleeping on the streets and tents under 100 degree Fahrenheit [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=401.7s)]
*  scorching heat. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=408.34s)]
*  And then there are like, you know, an uncountable number of people buried and I presume crushed [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=409.7s)]
*  under the rubble. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=417.3s)]
*  So the smell coming from the, you know, sadly, you know, corpses seem to be like really, really [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=418.26s)]
*  strong. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=429.38s)]
*  And, you know, Mandalay is about two or three million population. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=429.86s)]
*  And, you know, more than 50 percent of the city structures have been destroyed. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=436.9s)]
*  And then the Zagong, our neighbor city across the river, 90 percent of the Zagong is completely [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=443.21999999999997s)]
*  crushed and then the aid is not reaching there. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=450.97999999999996s)]
*  Zarni, I'm wondering about aid and international aid. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=453.62s)]
*  You know what's going on in this country. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=459.62s)]
*  You were a student at the University of Wisconsin. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=461.38s)]
*  You have China, Russia, India quickly sending emergency teams. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=464.82s)]
*  And a meager three-person team from the U.S. hasn't even arrived here yet. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=470.1s)]
*  On Friday, some workers at USAID's Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance received layoff [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=475.78000000000003s)]
*  emails while they were preparing to respond to the earthquake. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=481.22s)]
*  What are you calling for when it comes to international aid from the United States, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=485.38s)]
*  but also from all over the world? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=489.38s)]
*  It's a panic. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=494.82s)]
*  Every type of humanitarian assistance from any quarter of the world that wishes to help. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=496.34000000000003s)]
*  The military, to my initial excitement, has said they would receive any international [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=502.98s)]
*  assistance from any country, whether hostile to the junta or not. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=510.26s)]
*  So I was quite excited to hear that statement from the junta head, May online. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=514.5s)]
*  I think, aside from how the military responds to the international offer of assistance, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=521.0600000000001s)]
*  I think we're not even talking about the USAID help or the American taxpayers' money. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=527.7s)]
*  There is one billion U.S. dollars frozen as a result of the February 2021 military coup [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=533.86s)]
*  by the Biden administration. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=541.7s)]
*  That money, if there is any time that is good for that money to be unfrozen, it's now. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=544.26s)]
*  I understand that the Biden and Trump administration did not or do not want to [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=553.14s)]
*  release that money and then put fuel into the raging civil war. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=559.78s)]
*  But that money should be set up internationally and handled by an international body. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=565.86s)]
*  One billion dollars for earthquake rescue and relief funds. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=573.6999999999999s)]
*  That is something that the Trump administration and the Congress should seriously consider. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=579.6999999999999s)]
*  This is the darkest hour of need for the Myanmar people. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=585.6999999999999s)]
*  Forget the regime. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=590.02s)]
*  Forget the resistance. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=591.06s)]
*  Forget the civil war. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=592.0999999999999s)]
*  We need to get some kind of humanitarian ceasefire for like, say, 100 decades by every actor [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=593.78s)]
*  involved in the conflict and get the rescue and reconstruction begin. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yOurSAdsn0&t=602.66s)]
