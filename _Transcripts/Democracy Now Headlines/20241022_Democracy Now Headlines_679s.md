# Top U.S. & World Headlines — October 22, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmswutJDeoY)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israeli forces have barred rescue teams from reaching Palestinians trapped under the rubble
*  of collapsed buildings as Israel's siege on the northern Gaza Strip continues into
*  its 18th day.
*  On Monday, Israeli drones equipped with loudspeakers hovered over shelters for displaced Palestinians
*  in Bethlehia, blaring messages ordering them to flee through military checkpoints.
*  Witnesses say Israeli soldiers entered the shelters, separated men from their families
*  at gunpoint and instructed women and children to move southward.
*  The mass expulsion came amidst continued unrelenting Israeli attacks, including a strike on Bethlehia
*  that killed 15 Palestinians, including children.
*  Gaza's Health Ministry reports at least 115 Palestinians have been killed over the
*  last 48 hours.
*  500 more were wounded, bringing the reported number of people wounded in Israel's year-long
*  war to more than 100,000, with nearly 43,000 killed and over 17,000 of them children, though
*  both figures are likely to be a vast undercount.
*  Northern Gaza's last three operational hospitals remain besieged, with more than 350 patients
*  inside Al-Ada, Indonesian and Kamel Adwan hospitals.
*  Dr. Marwan Alhams is director of Gaza's field hospitals.
*  Israel has not allowed the entry of any medicine, treatment and medical supplies to the north
*  of Gaza.
*  In addition, the Israeli occupation is preventing the entry of food and nutrition for the medical
*  teams and patients inside the hospitals, and it is directly targeting the hospitals.
*  Meanwhile, Gaza officials say Israeli forces have blocked the entry of more than a quarter
*  of a million trucks carrying food and other vital aid into Gaza in the last year, as Israel's
*  accused of using starvation as a weapon of war.
*  In Lebanon, rescue workers are searching for civilians trapped under the rubble of their
*  homes after Israel's military carried out more than a dozen strikes overnight on Beirut
*  and its southern suburbs.
*  At least 13 people, including a child, were killed, 57 others injured in an Israeli airstrike
*  near the Rafiq Hadi-Adi University Hospital, Lebanon's largest public medical center.
*  At least 32 others were wounded in the attack, which caused major damage to the hospital.
*  Separately, 50 medical workers and 15 patients were forced to evacuate the Asahel hospital
*  in southern Beirut Monday after Israel's military claimed without evidence its home
*  to a secret underground Hezbollah bunker containing hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and
*  gold.
*  Doctors insisted there's nothing hidden beneath the hospital and took reporters on
*  a tour of its lower floors to disprove the claims.
*  In Israel, air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv earlier today as Hezbollah fired a volley
*  of rockets from Lebanon.
*  Hezbollah said the attacks targeted a military base south of Tel Aviv, as well as a naval
*  base northwest of Haifa.
*  Meanwhile, Syrian media is reporting at least two people were killed and three others injured
*  Monday when an Israeli guided missile slammed into a car in Damascus.
*  Israel's military claimed responsibility, saying the strike killed the head of Hezbollah's
*  money transfers unit.
*  Israeli cabinet members and officials with the ruling Likud party called Monday for the
*  reestablishment of illegal Israeli settlements in Gaza for the ethnic cleansing of the territory's
*  Palestinian inhabitants.
*  Far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gavir spoke from a conference of settler
*  groups and ultra-nationalists near Israel's border with Gaza, where he declared,
*  "'We will encourage voluntary transfer of all Gazan citizens.
*  We will offer them the opportunity to move to other countries because that land belongs
*  to us,' he said.
*  The conference was organized by the Nahala Settlement Movement, whose leader, Daniella
*  Weiss, said thousands of settlers are set to move to Gaza.
*  We came here with one clear purpose.
*  The purpose is to settle the entire Gaza Strip, not just part of it, not just a few settlements,
*  the entire Gaza Strip from north to south.
*  Thousands of people are ready to move to Gaza now.
*  As a result of the brutal massacre of the 7th of October, the Gaza Arabs lost the right
*  to be here ever, so they will go to the different countries of the world.
*  They will not stay here."
*  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Tel Aviv for talks with Israeli
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders.
*  The State Department claims Blinken's trip is aimed at reviving failed Gaza ceasefire
*  negotiations, yet the Biden administration continues to refuse calls for an arms embargo
*  against Netanyahu's government amidst record U.S. military assistance to Israel.
*  This is Blinken's 11th visit to the region since Israel launched its latest war on Gaza
*  last October.
*  Meanwhile, calls are growing for U.S. officials to investigate reports of the Israeli army
*  using abducted Palestinians as human shields in Gaza, often forcing them to walk ahead
*  of Israeli soldiers to inspect underground tunnels and buildings.
*  The use of human shields is a war crime.
*  In related news, a group of 60 House Democrats are demanding the Biden administration, quote,
*  take immediate action to advocate for unrestricted independent media access to Gaza, as Israel's
*  blocked foreign journalists from entering over the course of its year-long assault on
*  Gaza.
*  Five falsely convicted New Yorkers, who became known as the Central Park Five, have filed
*  a defamation lawsuit against Donald Trump after the Republican presidential candidate
*  wrongfully suggested at last month's debate with Kamala Harris that the five confessed
*  to a crime they did not commit.
*  In 1989, the group of one Latino and four black teenagers were falsely accused and convicted
*  of raping a white jogger in Central Park.
*  As the boys faced a barrage of racism and police misconduct, Trump took out a full-page
*  ad in The New York Times calling for reinstatement of the death penalty.
*  Four members of the redubbed Exonerated Five, including New York City Councilmember Yusef
*  Salam, spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August.
*  You can see our interview with Councilmember Salam at DemocracyNow.org.
*  The Mueqa'oloni tribe is demanding an apology from Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and the
*  National Park Service police after members of the tribe were assaulted, arrested and
*  violently removed from the National Mall by federal police last week.
*  A contingent of the tribe had just completed a seven-day journey on horseback from the
*  to Washington, D.C., coinciding with Indigenous Peoples' Day.
*  The Mueqa'oloni tribe says it will use Freedom of Information Act requests to investigate
*  why it was attacked as the group continues its campaign to restore federal recognition.
*  Texas lawmakers heard testimony Monday in the case of death row prisoner Robert Robertson,
*  whose execution last week was halted at the eleventh hour by the Texas Supreme Court,
*  but Robertson, who'd been subpoenaed, did not appear before the Texas House Committee
*  after his lawyers determined it was not appropriate due to his communication challenges linked
*  to his autism.
*  Robertson's 2003 murder conviction was based on the shaken baby syndrome theory, which
*  has never been scientifically validated.
*  Among those who did testify was Terry Compton, a juror in Robertson's 2003 trial.
*  I started thinking back about all the things that I knew about that went on in the trial,
*  and I just realized, and I just finally came to the conclusion, he was an innocent man.
*  And I just, in good conscience, I could not live with myself thinking that I had a hand
*  in putting an innocent man to death.
*  The Texas House panel says they will seek alternatives to hear directly from Robertson
*  as they continue to consider his case.
*  In Guatemala, prominent journalist José Rubén Zamora has been transferred from prison to
*  house arrest after serving two of his six-year sentence behind bars.
*  Zamora is the founder of El Periodico, which was known for its investigative reporting
*  on corruption.
*  He was convicted in 2022 of money laundering charges as part of then-President Alejandro
*  Diamante's crackdown on the press and dissent.
*  Zamora spoke to reporters and supporters as he left Guatemala City Prison on Saturday.
*  And I think they're going to try to lock me up again.
*  And I want you to be certain that it may be that they are bluffing or it may be true.
*  And if they are going to bring me back, I will wait for them at my house again.
*  And I will come back here.
*  I think that kind of actions are affecting them, not me.
*  You can see our past coverage of this case and our interview with Zamora's son at DemocracyNow.org.
*  And the legendary singer and activist Barbara Dayne has died in her Oakland home.
*  She died Sunday.
*  She was 97 years old.
*  In the 1950s, Dayne became a popular blues singer, performed with many leading musicians
*  of the time, including Louis Armstrong, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon and others.
*  She eventually largely dropped out of the commercial music world to focus on social
*  justice, becoming involved in the civil rights movement as well as the GI resistance movement
*  during the Vietnam War.
*  She and her husband Erwin Sober started the record label Paradon to release music from
*  freedom struggles across the globe.
*  She was one of many artists the FBI surveilled because of their activism.
*  In 2018, Barbara Dayne stopped by the Democracy Now! studios to talk about her remarkable
*  life and to perform a few songs.
*  With parking lots filled up, with playgrounds and schools, we can do what we like, because
*  we like what we do.
*  We build gardens and hospitals in every mall, and we'll stop the wars once and for all.
*  What?
*  Stop the wars once and for all.
*  What?
*  Stop the wars once and for all.
*  Yes, be reasonable and demand the impossible now.
*  Yes, be reasonable and demand the impossible now.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  Thank you.
