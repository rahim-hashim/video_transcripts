In a 6-3 decision on Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s ban on puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender youth, paving the way for other bans on trans healthcare to remain in effect in 24 other states. According to the ACLU, over 100,000 transgender people under the age of 18 now live in a state with a ban on their healthcare. “This is a fight that extends back 100 years, and we will keep fighting for 100 more years,” says Chase Strangio, the first openly trangender attorney to make oral arguments before the Supreme Court and the co-director of the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBTQ & HIV Project.

# "Harming Young People": Chase Strangio on SCOTUS Trans Heathcare Ban & End of LGBTQ Suicide Hotline
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg)
*  In a 6-3 decision Wednesday, the Supreme Court upheld Tennessee's ban on puberty blockers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=0.0s)]

*  with a ban on their healthcare. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=20.8s)]
*  The court's right-wing justices rejected arguments on behalf of Tennessee trans kids [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=23.84s)]
*  and their parents, which claimed the ban on those treatments discriminated on the basis [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=28.64s)]
*  of sex because they remained permitted for other medical treatments for non-trans youth. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=33.6s)]
*  In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused her conservative colleagues of, quote, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=41.84s)]
*  "...contorting logic and precedent and abandoning transgender children and their families to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=47.84s)]
*  political whims." [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=52.58s)]
*  Unquote. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=53.84s)]
*  These activists rallied at a Washington, D.C., church after the ruling. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=55.08s)]
*  They can say I'm a woman, but I live as a man. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=59.08s)]
*  I live as a man. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=63.08s)]
*  I live through this world as a man. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=65.08s)]
*  Let me be saying, the legislature will ever change that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=74.08s)]
*  We're joined now in studio by Chase Strangio, the ACLU attorney who argued the case known [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=78.08s)]
*  as United States v. Skirmety before the Supreme Court in December. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=83.84s)]
*  Chase made history by becoming the first openly trans attorney to argue at the high court, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=87.84s)]
*  a story captured in the new documentary, Heightened Scrutiny. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=93.76s)]
*  Chase, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=97.84s)]
*  Thanks so much for being with us. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=99.84s)]
*  Explain what happened. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  Explain the decision of the Supreme Court this week. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=103.0s)]
*  Thanks, Amy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=105.44s)]
*  So in the decision, the Supreme Court in essence said that Tennessee's law, which bans puberty [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=106.44s)]
*  blockers and hormone therapy when they are prescribed in a way that is inconsistent with [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=112.44s)]
*  an adolescent's sex, that's what the statute says, is not discriminatory. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=117.32s)]
*  It doesn't discriminate based on sex or transgender status, and therefore the government of Tennessee [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=121.32s)]
*  has wide latitude to regulate in this area. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=127.16s)]
*  Now I think Justice Sotomayor got it exactly right in her dissent that they had to contort [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=130.72s)]
*  logic and precedent in order to reach the conclusion that a law that says you can do [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=135.46s)]
*  something consistent with your sex but you can't do something inconsistent with your [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  sex is not a form of sex discrimination, but ultimately the 6-3 conservative majority said [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  that it was not discriminatory. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=150.8s)]
*  As you noted, paving the way for the 24 laws that ban this care for adolescents in the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  United States to remain in effect. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  Tell us the story of the family that's at the core of this case. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so one of the most heartbreaking things about this moment is just thinking about the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=164.36s)]
*  families and the parents and as a parent what it means to watch your child suffer. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=169.36s)]
*  So we represent three families. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=174.68s)]
*  LW is one of the adolescents and her parents who we sued Tennessee on behalf of. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to interrupt for one sec just to read about this case, an excerpt from a New [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=181.8s)]
*  York Times opinion piece written by Samantha Williams, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=187.24s)]
*  challenging Tennessee's ban on gender affirming care. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Her daughter has only been identified by the initials LW. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=195.38s)]
*  The op-ed is titled My Daughter was at the Center of the Supreme Court Case on Trans [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=199.98s)]
*  Care. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=204.66s)]
*  Our Hearts are Broken. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=205.66s)]
*  She writes, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=207.5s)]
*  My daughter LW came out as transgender late in 2020. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=208.5s)]
*  She was just shy of 13. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=212.14s)]
*  Four and a half years later she's thriving, healthy and happy after pursuing evidence-based [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=214.3s)]
*  gender affirming care. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=220.22s)]
*  I've devoted myself to finding our daughter consistent care in one state after another. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=221.7s)]
*  The nightmare of our disrupted life pales in comparison with the nightmare of losing [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=227.54s)]
*  access to the healthcare that's allowed our daughter to thrive. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=232.45999999999998s)]
*  If one thing gives me hope, it's my daughter. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=236.83999999999997s)]
*  Even after all the emotions of today, LW has been texting me all day about her plans for [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=240.62s)]
*  how to continue the fight for young people like her. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  Tell us more, Chase. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=251.02s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean, I think Samantha hits it on the head is these are parents who watched [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=252.02s)]
*  their children suffer tremendously for many years, looking for a solution, doing their [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=256.94s)]
*  own research, talking to medical experts. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=262.0s)]
*  And then what they found was that their children who were experiencing this intense distress [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=264.58s)]
*  began to thrive when they had access to gender affirming medical care like hormones and puberty [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=270.74s)]
*  blockers. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=275.06s)]
*  And these are not rushed decisions. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=276.06s)]
*  These are careful decisions that parents are making with their children and their doctors. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=278.02s)]
*  And what Tennessee did, what these other governments have done, is come in and displaced the judgment [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=282.28s)]
*  of parents and adolescents and doctors and substituted their own ideological preferences [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  for how people live and identify. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=291.5s)]
*  Clearly a blow to the transgender community. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=293.94s)]
*  It was a 6-3 ruling. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=296.7s)]
*  Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority, opening, quote, saying, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=298.62s)]
*  This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=303.34s)]
*  efficacy and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=308.9s)]
*  The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=313.26s)]
*  The implications for all are profound. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=316.38s)]
*  The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=318.9s)]
*  And again, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the High Court, quote, abandons transgender children [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=323.62s)]
*  and their families to political whims, as well as undermines the Constitution, saying [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=330.14s)]
*  the decision causes, quote, irrevocable damage to the Equal Protection Clause and invites [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=335.58s)]
*  legislators to engage in discrimination by hiding blatant sex classifications in plain [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=340.34s)]
*  sight. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=346.21999999999997s)]
*  In sadness, I dissent, Justice Sotomayor said. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=347.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think Justice—Chief Justice Roberts' language there is just wrong in [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=350.46s)]
*  so many different ways. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=356.14s)]
*  First, the medical debate that he is referencing was not a debate that the district court found [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=357.54s)]
*  in the court's factual findings. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=364.46s)]
*  It was a Trump-appointed district court judge who looked at the evidence and concluded that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=366.26s)]
*  the Tennessee's arguments in support of their ban just did not bear—did not hold up to [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=370.34s)]
*  scrutiny. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=376.22s)]
*  But even more importantly, the question of whether or not the law discriminates based [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=377.22s)]
*  on sex on its face does not consider that medical debate. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=381.58s)]
*  Looking at the plain language of the statute, it says you can do something consistent with [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=385.58s)]
*  your sex. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=389.58s)]
*  You can't do something inconsistent with your sex. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=390.58s)]
*  If the court starts importing their own ideas about what's a good or bad sex-based distinction, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=392.38s)]
*  we're back to 50 years ago when they're allowing all sorts of discriminatory laws [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=397.18s)]
*  to stand. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  What's Bostock and explain how it's affected by this? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so as much as this is a devastating decision, I think it's important to make [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=405.46s)]
*  sure people understand that it does not do some of the damage that people feared. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=409.86s)]
*  So Bostock is a 2020 Supreme Court decision in which the court held that Title VII of [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=414.5s)]
*  the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits sex discrimination in employment, also prohibits [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=420.14s)]
*  discrimination against LGBTQ people. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=424.28s)]
*  And that decision was a 6-3 decision from Justice Gorsuch. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=427.42s)]
*  And in the Scrametti case, the court explicitly leaves intact that decision, and the court [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=432.34s)]
*  says that they are declining to address whether that decision applies outside the context [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=439.14s)]
*  of Title VII. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=444.28s)]
*  And that's important because it means that litigation over things like discrimination [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=445.34s)]
*  in school, other forms of discrimination by the government, remain open to fight another [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=450.08s)]
*  day. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  Can you talk about the other cases in the last few weeks that have gone actually both [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=457.78s)]
*  ways? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=464.32s)]
*  But before you do, I mean, the irony of conservative justices and conservative states or states [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=465.32s)]
*  run by Republicans that have always insisted, for example, when it comes to abortion, a [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=472.52s)]
*  kid has to tell their parents when it comes to parental consent, et cetera. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=477.78s)]
*  You have LW's parents with a doctor in a room with LW. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=483.08s)]
*  They're all hashing this out. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=489.4s)]
*  Yes, you have this aligned judgment of parents, adolescents and doctors, and the government [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  is coming in and imposing their preference. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=497.44s)]
*  that in every other context are spouting how important parental rights are, parental right [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=501.06s)]
*  to not mask your child, parental rights to not have your child learn about LGBT people [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=506.78000000000003s)]
*  in school or the history of racism in the United States. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=511.5s)]
*  So this is hypocrisy at its most clear point, and I think we should really be watching for [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=514.52s)]
*  when the Supreme Court upholds the parental rights of parents to, for example, stop their [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=520.28s)]
*  children from accessing contraception or abortion. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=526.2s)]
*  But when it's the parents who love and support their trans children, all of a sudden, their [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=528.88s)]
*  parental rights don't matter. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=532.96s)]
*  Separately on Wednesday, Trump's Health Department ordered the National Suicide Hotline [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=535.96s)]
*  for LGBTQ-plus youth to shut down. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=542.48s)]
*  In its announcement, HHS omitted reference to the transgender population using the term [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=547.4s)]
*  One advocate called the move a potential death sentence for thousands of LGBTQ-plus youth. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=554.64s)]
*  It reminded me of a racing from the federal website around Stonewall, which is a federal [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=564.88s)]
*  monument now, that was led by trans women that launched the modern-day LGBTQ movement, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=570.1999999999999s)]
*  taking out the T there. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=578.88s)]
*  What about here? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=580.92s)]
*  And what about the hotline itself? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=582.48s)]
*  What it means? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=583.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is a population that has unique vulnerability to suicidality. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=584.76s)]
*  This service was vital for LGBTQ young people. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=589.64s)]
*  And what the administration is doing is making abundantly clear that their systematic attacks [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=593.1s)]
*  on the LGBTQ community are not about protecting anyone. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=598.9s)]
*  They are about harming young people, taking away vital services. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=602.84s)]
*  If you put this in conversation with the bans on trans people serving in the military, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=606.2s)]
*  the bans on people going to the bathroom, participating in sports, and now the decision [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=612.0400000000001s)]
*  in Scrimetti, you have a country that is prepared to not only fully attack us across all areas [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=616.08s)]
*  of life, but take away our lifelines, quite literally. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=622.24s)]
*  Can you talk about Judge Young and the decision that came out of Boston? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so this is a decision in a challenge to the government's attempts to cut off [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=632.6s)]
*  NIH grants any time they reference LGBT people or people of color. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=637.68s)]
*  And Judge Young issued an injunction, in essence, forcing the government to reissue those grants [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=643.24s)]
*  and said from the bench that in his 40 years on the bench, he has not seen such rank discrimination [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=648.6s)]
*  on the basis of race and that this is plain as plain can be, that this government is invested [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=656.04s)]
*  in discriminating against people of color and LGBT people and ordered them to restart [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=661.16s)]
*  those vital grants. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=666.3199999999999s)]
*  Because not only are we living in a moment that is anti-people of color, anti-LGBT people [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=667.6s)]
*  from this administration, but they are also anti-science and cutting off vital research [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=673.4s)]
*  avenues that judges thankfully are stepping in and trying to restore as much as possible. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=678.04s)]
*  And Young was a Reagan-appointed judge. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=684.3199999999999s)]
*  He said he's never seen discrimination like this. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=686.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=689.76s)]
*  And there's another Reagan-appointed judge in the district of D.C. that ordered the administration [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=690.84s)]
*  to stop banning gender-affirming medical care for trans people in the Bureau of Prisons. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=695.64s)]
*  This is an administration that is attacking us in every aspect of life. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=701.04s)]
*  And judge after judge across the political spectrum, going back to Reagan-appointed judges, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=705.92s)]
*  are stepping in and saying, absolutely not. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=710.68s)]
*  Can you respond to the New York Times piece that just came out, major hit piece against [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=712.88s)]
*  you, Chase, that was written by Nicolas Confessori? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=717.36s)]
*  It's headlined, How the Transgender Rights Movement Bet on the Supreme Court and Lost. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=720.48s)]
*  Confessori writes, quote, Strangio and other advocates for trans rights have cast scrimmety [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=727.48s)]
*  as the case they had to bring and may also have set back their movement back a generation. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=733.08s)]
*  Well, I think that's just absolutely wrong. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=739.44s)]
*  This is a fight that extends back 100 years, and we will keep fighting for 100 more years. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=742.64s)]
*  The piece absolutely gets it wrong in terms of what this decision does and doesn't do. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=748.56s)]
*  It's a narrow decision. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=753.48s)]
*  It leaves open many other avenues to fight back against discrimination on behalf of trans [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=754.48s)]
*  people. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=758.68s)]
*  But for everyone who is saying that the movement got ahead of public opinion, that litigators [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=759.68s)]
*  got ahead of public opinion, the very purpose of the Equal Protection Clause, the very purpose [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=764.16s)]
*  of the Reconstruction Amendments is to be a check on majoritarian discrimination. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=769.0799999999999s)]
*  If the public's opinion is that you deserve to have your constitutional rights infringed, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=774.1800000000001s)]
*  then the very purpose of the Constitution is to step in. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=779.3000000000001s)]
*  That is the role of the federal courts and that is the role of civil rights advocates, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=781.62s)]
*  and we will keep fighting. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=784.94s)]
*  The hit piece comes at the same time as a major documentary on you, Chase. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=786.1800000000001s)]
*  The documentary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=791.3000000000001s)]
*  It was also at DC Docs, the new film festival in Washington, D.C. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=794.7s)]
*  It's called Heightened Scrutiny. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=799.58s)]
*  It shows you addressing trans community members and supporters outside the Supreme Court after [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=802.86s)]
*  you made history as the first openly trans lawyer to deliver oral arguments in front [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=808.3000000000001s)]
*  of the court. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=813.66s)]
*  The hearing back in December was for this case. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=815.3000000000001s)]
*  We are the defiance of everything. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=819.58s)]
*  OK. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=824.58s)]
*  Peppermint loves to give me advice about how to project. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=825.58s)]
*  This is how I'm going to work on it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=828.58s)]
*  We are collectively a reputation of everything they say about us. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=832.3000000000001s)]
*  And our fight for justice did not begin today. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=840.3000000000001s)]
*  It will not end in June, whatever the court decides. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=846.1s)]
*  We are in this together. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=848.7800000000001s)]
*  We are in it together. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=851.1s)]
*  Our power only grows. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=852.1s)]
*  I love being trans. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=854.22s)]
*  I love being with you. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=857.0600000000001s)]
*  And we are going to take care of each other. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=860.3000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=863.3000000000001s)]
*  I felt it inside. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=865.3000000000001s)]
*  That's Chase Strangio, a clip from the new film Heightened Scrutiny that will also premiere [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=870.3000000000001s)]
*  in Los Angeles next week at the Hammer Museum. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=877.98s)]
*  Talk about what you're hoping to accomplish with this film. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=882.7800000000001s)]
*  Well, I think one of the really important things about this film is that it offers a [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=885.7s)]
*  critique of mainstream media coverage of transgender people in our health care in addition to the [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=889.82s)]
*  verite parts that are me preparing for oral argument. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=895.14s)]
*  And one of the things the film really highlights is the ways in which the media's outsized [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=898.86s)]
*  fixation on transgender people contributes to anti-trans policymaking. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=903.34s)]
*  Media Matters reported that in the last four months, Fox News ran 400 segments on transgender [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=908.7s)]
*  athletes. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=913.58s)]
*  If you think about the fact that we are less than 1% of the population, transgender athletes [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=914.58s)]
*  must be one hundredth of a percent of the population, and yet this outsized fixation [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=919.82s)]
*  with us and our lives is what is driving so much of the anti-trans policies that we're [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=924.46s)]
*  seeing. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=929.98s)]
*  And so it's so important that we challenge those narratives, that we make people aware [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=930.98s)]
*  of the misinformation that they are receiving, because if we don't, we're going to continue [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=934.5s)]
*  to see these attacks. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=938.58s)]
*  And finally, the decision also this week around passports. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=939.98s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's really important for people to know that we're still getting good decisions [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=943.5s)]
*  in the lower courts. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=946.94s)]
*  The judge said that in essence, Trump's policy of forcing people to have passports listing [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=948.7800000000001s)]
*  their sex assigned at birth is blocked, not just for our six-name plaintiffs, but for [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=952.62s)]
*  everyone across the country. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=956.82s)]
*  People can reapply for both binary passports and ex-passports under the policy. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=958.46s)]
*  Explain what you mean. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=963.0200000000001s)]
*  Either your male or female doesn't have to match your... [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=964.0200000000001s)]
*  Your sex assigned at birth. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=966.5s)]
*  Or you can do ex. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=967.5s)]
*  Or you can do ex. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=969.46s)]
*  And that was the policy on January 19th, and in essence the court says we're back to January [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=970.46s)]
*  respect to the policy, and transgender people, non-binary people and intersex people can [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=975.42s)]
*  apply for the M, F and ex-passports that match who they are, not what their sex was at conception, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=979.6999999999999s)]
*  which is the Trump administration's preference. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6A_rhLIRg&t=985.42s)]
