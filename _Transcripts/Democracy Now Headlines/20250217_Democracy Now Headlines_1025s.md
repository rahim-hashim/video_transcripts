The Oscar-nominated documentary _Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat_ recounts the events leading up to Black American jazz musicians Abbey Lincoln and Max Roach's 1961 protest at the United Nations of the CIA-backed killing of Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba. The first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lumumba was an icon of the pan-African and anti-colonial movements. He was tortured and killed shortly after the formation of the first government of independent Congo following a military coup supported by Belgium, the United States and powerful mining interests. _Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat_'s Belgian director Johan Grimonprez explains that Lumumba's assassination was "the ground zero of how the West was about to deal with the riches of the African continent."

*  through our Carvel footage, the film's sweeping story of the events leading up to the pivotal [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=12.96s)]
*  chapter in Congo's history, the 1961 assassination of the Congolese president, the independence [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=17.28s)]
*  leader, Patrice Lumumba, the film tracing the long, brutal history of mineral exploitation [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=24.0s)]
*  in Congo from the time when Congo was a possession of the Belgian king Leopold II, all the way [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=28.64s)]
*  to the conflict minerals of today, showing the power of the mining industry, highlighting [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=34.28s)]
*  the role of the Belgian mining company Union Minier in the overthrow and murder of Lumumba. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Soundtrack to A Coup d'état features several key leaders at the time, including President [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=44.2s)]
*  Eisenhower, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, former U.N. Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=48.28s)]

*  and Louis Armstrong. This is a trailer. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=57.32s)]
*  We were to go to a little bit of jail to attend a concert given by Louis Armstrong. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=88.16s)]
*  How much money do the Central Intelligence Agency has poured into the Congo? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. Are you prepared to say? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=97.55999999999999s)]
*  I certainly, of course, don't know. I wonder if it's quite honest to represent our policy [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=99.08s)]
*  as completely angelic. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=103.8s)]
*  And seated out on the terrace was a man I recognized. He said, well, you have to assassinate Lumumba. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  He used those words. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=114.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=116.32s)]
*  But who ordered him? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=117.32s)]
*  He said President Eisenhower. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=120.32s)]
*  In the U.N., when Khrushchev took off his shoe and was beating that shoe and the interpreter [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=122.32s)]
*  said, oh, Mary! Talk about America. Khrushchev was saying, I love you, but it was the interpreter [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=129.32s)]
*  who hated America. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=138.32s)]
*  But did he have rhythm? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=139.32s)]
*  Rhythm is my business. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=147.32s)]
*  Death to colonial slavery. Bury it. Bury it deep in the ground. The deeper, the better. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=161.32s)]
*  The trailer for Soundtrack to a coup d'état, nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=167.32s)]
*  I just interviewed the director of the film, the Belgian filmmaker Johan Grimamprey, and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=182.32s)]
*  began by asking him why he made it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=188.32s)]
*  Well, it roots back in the ignorance, not knowing and growing up in Belgium, but not [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=190.32s)]
*  learning that story in school. And so here we have war being privatized and a template [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=194.82s)]
*  of a corporatocracy that is dictating what sort of happens in the war industry. You could [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=200.82s)]
*  actually project that template exactly on what was going on with that pivotal moment [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=207.82s)]
*  when Congo became independent. And so it's the mining industry, specifically in your [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=211.82s)]
*  mini-era, going back to Société Générale, that was actually composite in the overthrow [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=216.82s)]
*  of Patrice Lumumba and ultimately subsequently its assassination. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=221.82s)]
*  Tell us the story of King Leopold and the Congo and then Congo's independence. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=225.82s)]
*  Well, for example, Union Minier de Otkatanga was a private company by Leopold II. He actually, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=232.82s)]
*  the free state of Congo was his personal property. And so what we see in that sort of moment [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=240.82s)]
*  towards independence, still sort of a lot of stuff is lingering. Union Minier was actually [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=247.82s)]
*  holding, having a huge hold over the country. And so when Patrice Lumumba became the first [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=252.82s)]
*  independent leader of the Congo, Union Minier concocted, actually succeeded in the province [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=258.82s)]
*  of Katanga installing a marionette, President Moshe Chambe, to actually get back at Patrice [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=263.82s)]
*  Lumumba reconquering the Congo in a sort of a neo-colonial grab. You know, people talk [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=271.82s)]
*  about post-colonialism, but actually it's a misnomer. What was sort of the ground zero [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=276.82s)]
*  of how the West was about to deal with the riches of the African continent was actually [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=280.82s)]
*  the assassination of Patrice Lumumba. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=284.82s)]
*  And talk about what the black U.S. jazz musicians have to do with the Democratic Republic of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=286.82s)]
*  the Congo. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=294.82s)]
*  Well, the context is that we have the 15 General Assembly, right? 16 African countries are [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=296.82s)]
*  admitted to the world body, and it actually causes a global shift, a political earthquake [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=303.82s)]
*  within that world body, where 16 African countries actually make that the global shift, sort [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=308.82s)]
*  of the Afro-Asian bloc suddenly gains the majority vote in the United Nations. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=313.82s)]
*  They become independent countries, these African countries. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=317.82s)]
*  They are admitted to the world body as independent countries, and it shifts the global vote. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=320.82s)]
*  The Afro-Asian bloc is actually gaining the majority vote. And so we have East and West [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=325.82s)]
*  sort of trying to wrestle control over the United Nations General Assembly. Nikita Khrushchev [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=331.82s)]
*  would introduce the decolonization resolution to get the global south on his case. Nikita [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=336.82s)]
*  Khrushchev, the then Soviet premier of Russia. And then we have the United States ruled by [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=341.82s)]
*  President Eisenhower, would send in arm twisters to actually buy up votes within the United [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=347.82s)]
*  Nations General Assembly. But also subsequently, one month later, they would send black jazz [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=353.82s)]
*  ambassadors into the Congo. It was the United States Information Agency already before we [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=358.82s)]
*  were sending black jazz ambassadors out. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=363.82s)]
*  So USIA, the US Information Agency, is sending black jazz musicians to the Congo. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=365.82s)]
*  It was a strategy that was already mid-50s. It was a way to actually win the hearts and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=373.82s)]
*  minds of the global south. But I discovered that, for example, DGG Lesby was sent to Syria [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=379.82s)]
*  underneath. You had actually the CIA buying up the Syrian government. Like with Louis [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=384.82s)]
*  Armstrong arriving in the Congo one month after the General Assembly, the United States [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=390.82s)]
*  15th General Assembly, you see that actually the United States, in cohorts with the Belgian intelligence, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=394.82s)]
*  is actually plotting to overthrow the Lumumba government and also subsequently [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=399.82s)]
*  assassinating Patrice Lumumba. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=405.82s)]
*  I want to actually go to that moment at the end of the film. It's announced that Patrice [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=407.82s)]
*  Lumumba has been assassinated, and we'll talk about who is involved with his assassination. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=413.82s)]
*  But it's from February 15th, 1961, when protesters led by the jazz great, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=418.82s)]
*  Abby Lincoln, led by Max Roach and the great writer Maya Angelou, stormed the UN Security Council [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=427.82s)]
*  to protest the murder of Patrice Lumumba. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=435.82s)]
*  Shall the United Nations survive? Shall the attempt to bring about peace by the concerted [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=439.82s)]
*  power of international understanding be discarded? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=445.82s)]
*  It's an incredible moment. You bigoted MFers. They're yelling. They're comparing them [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=468.82s)]
*  to the KKK. And that was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai Stevenson, under [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=478.82s)]
*  John F. Kennedy. He was giving his maiden speech. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=484.82s)]
*  And it was immediately interrupted by 60 protesters and the lead by Abby Lincoln, the jazz singer, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=488.82s)]
*  in sort of conjunction with the Women's Writer Coalition in Harlem, amongst Maya Angelou [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=496.82s)]
*  and Rosa Guy. And they crashed to secure the council to protest the murder. This is three days. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=502.82s)]
*  You have to know that Patrice Lumumba was murdered three days before President Kennedy became [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=507.82s)]
*  president as well. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=512.8199999999999s)]
*  He was elected, but it was January 17th, so it's before his inauguration, right? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=514.8199999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=521.8199999999999s)]
*  So this is under Eisenhower, this took place. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=522.8199999999999s)]
*  Exactly. But the protest, because they kept it quiet one month, and then it was announced [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=524.82s)]
*  at the Security Council, 15th of February, 1961. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=529.82s)]
*  So the soundtrack, of course it's called Soundtrack to a Coup d'état, the soundtrack [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=533.82s)]
*  of this documentary, the jazz greats of the United States, and as you talked about, recruited [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=541.82s)]
*  by the USIA, the US Intelligence Agency, to play in Africa. So talk about their role, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=547.82s)]
*  like Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, and what they understood they were being used for. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=554.82s)]
*  When you see that actually the black jazz investors were sent out as a cover for actually [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=561.82s)]
*  coup d'état that were plotted underneath, hence also the title, Soundtrack to a Coup d'état. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=566.82s)]
*  So you have Louis Armstrong actually upon invitation by Strolens, who was the CEO of [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=571.82s)]
*  Union Minier, the company that actually propped up Moshe Chombey, the then marionette president [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=576.82s)]
*  in Katanga, which was used to secede from Lumumba's sort of greater Congo and to actually cause [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=581.82s)]
*  a rift. We have Patrice Lumumba, Louis Armstrong arriving third week of October, and then he [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=587.82s)]
*  comes back in Katanga third week of November. You have to know, actually he was staying [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=592.82s)]
*  at Moshe Chombey's, the then marionette president in Katanga, and his house. And so that night [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=597.82s)]
*  we have dinner, Larry Devon, Louis Armstrong, US Ambassador Timberlake. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=603.82s)]
*  Explain who Larry Devon was. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=608.82s)]
*  Larry Devon was head of the CA, but unbeknownst to Louis Armstrong, to him he was an agricultural [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=609.82s)]
*  advisor. That was his cover name. And there is also US Timberlake, and we have the Belgian [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=615.82s)]
*  advisors, that's Ramon Linden, who was the African minister, Belgian African minister, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=620.82s)]
*  and he's sitting at the table. But still, you know, you would think that they would be [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=625.82s)]
*  sent out as passive instruments of promoting democracy, which is very schizophrenic, because [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=631.82s)]
*  back home they were not allowed to vote. They were still second-rate citizens. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=637.82s)]
*  You mean the jazz musicians were not allowed to vote in the United States. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=640.82s)]
*  Exactly. It's very schizophrenic. But it's not because they're used as propaganda instruments [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=644.82s)]
*  to promote democracy. They actually were very much also, you know, not passive agents. You [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=650.82s)]
*  know, he would grill Moshe Chamet, say, you're in bed with big money. You know, you have [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=658.82s)]
*  to take some and give some. Or he would refuse to go play for an apartheid audience in South [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=662.82s)]
*  Africa. Or he would change the lyrics. I think that's very subtle. He would change the lyrics [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=667.82s)]
*  in the song that he also sung when he visited Ghana and sung for Kwame Nkrumah, the first [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=671.82s)]
*  independent leader of Ghana. The black and blue label, he would sing instead of I'm White [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=676.82s)]
*  Inside, he would change the words I'm Right Inside. Or even at one moment with the Little [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=681.82s)]
*  Rock, he would be very outspoken and refuse to go as a diplomatic ambassador to Russia [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=687.82s)]
*  and say, you know, and it's quoted from the New York Times, you know, he said the government [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=692.82s)]
*  can go to hell. So he was very outspoken in 1957. Later on, it was a bit more tricky because [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=696.82s)]
*  his concert was still being bombed, for example, in Knoxville after he came back from Africa [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=702.82s)]
*  by white supremacists. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=706.82s)]
*  One of the people who worked as an advisor on this film worked on Raoul Peck's great [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=708.82s)]
*  2000 film, Lumumba. That was like a quarter of a century ago. What new information has [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=716.82s)]
*  come out? You mentioned Larry Devlin, CIA, Eisenhower, the president of the United States [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=725.0200000000001s)]
*  at the time. What did the CIA and Eisenhower have to do with Lumumba's murder? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=731.7s)]
*  Well, a lot of new data came out with the publication of Ludwig Wittes' book, The Assassination [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=737.82s)]
*  of Patrice Lumumba in 1999, that actually also the United Nations and more specifically [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=742.98s)]
*  Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld was complicit in this whole affair of the downfall of Patrice [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=748.24s)]
*  Lumumba. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=752.9200000000001s)]
*  So Dag Hammarskjöld was the UN secretary general at the time. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=753.62s)]
*  At the time. He was complicit with the downfall of Lumumba and ultimately the capture but [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=758.0600000000001s)]
*  then also the assassination. Then also the monarchy was in the know about what was going [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=762.22s)]
*  on, that Lumumba was about to be sent over to Katanga. Mobutu was in the know. The Belgian [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=767.46s)]
*  Surrethia at the time was called, the Belgian intelligence was involved and they actually [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=772.58s)]
*  labeled Patrice Lumumba as a communist to get actually the United States and their camp [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=776.5400000000001s)]
*  on the coast. So President Eisenhower was afraid that the NATO, the western union of [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=780.74s)]
*  countries that would fall apart, he actually sided with the colonial countries in essence. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=788.0200000000001s)]
*  And so he, at the time, that came out in the church committee in 1976. There was a hearing [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=795.6999999999999s)]
*  in the mid-70s where a lot of that stuff came out. First there was actually the plotting [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=802.6999999999999s)]
*  to actually get rid of Fidel Castro but then they changed gear and then Patrice Lumumba [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=807.14s)]
*  became a priority because they were afraid he would become sort of siding with Nikita [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=812.22s)]
*  Khrushchev, the then Soviet premier. And so they all banded together to actually assassinate [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=816.66s)]
*  him. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=823.06s)]
*  And this was the first democratically leader of the Congo. And why? Because at the beginning [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=825.02s)]
*  of the film you hear Patrice Lumumba literally saying, I'm not a communist or a socialist, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=830.9s)]
*  I'm actually African. I'm first of all a sovereign leader who actually chooses that the riches [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=835.22s)]
*  of the country also benefit the country. And at the end of the film you see the conclusion [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=839.98s)]
*  of Malcolm X as well. He says, you know, it's not socialism, Marxism or communism they're [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=844.52s)]
*  afraid of, it's Africanism. It's actually either choosing to stand up and choosing that [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=848.5s)]
*  the riches would also come back to the population. But if you look at sort of what it's the Congolese [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=853.58s)]
*  algorithm, the Belgian Congolese writer in Colleges-en-Bouffan, he would sort of, what [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=859.1800000000001s)]
*  he would call the template, the Congolese algorithm that actually all conflicts that [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=864.9000000000001s)]

*  Congo? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=890.9s)]
*  It was ultimately a deal with Henry Spock because, you know, Belgium was overrun by [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=891.5s)]
*  the Germans and so we had a Nazi government at that time. So the King fled and then Spock, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=897.5s)]
*  the Prime Minister, fled to London and together with Churchill and Roosevelt, the President [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=904.26s)]
*  of the United States, they actually sort of made a deal that all uranium from the Belgian [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=910.3s)]
*  Congo would actually be part of the Manhattan Project basically. And, you know, that was [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=914.8599999999999s)]
*  3,000 tons, 70% high-grade uranium. Half of that was still above ground when Lumumba took [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyjm7AKfAE&t=921.38s)]
