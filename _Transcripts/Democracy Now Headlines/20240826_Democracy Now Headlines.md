# Top U.S. & World Headlines — August 26, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRO-6QCJDQA)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is calling for an immediate de-escalation
*  after Israel and Hezbollah exchange heavy fire over the weekend.
*  Early on Sunday morning, over 100 Israeli warplanes struck about 40 sites in Lebanon.
*  Hezbollah responded by launching hundreds of drones and rockets at Israel.
*  Three deaths were reported in Lebanon, one in Israel.
*  Israel described its attacks as preemptive, saying the raid was conducted to blunt an
*  imminent attack by Hezbollah.
*  But Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah rejected that claim.
*  HASSAN NASRALLAH, Hezbollah Leader
*  What happened was an aggression, not a preemptive action.
*  And if we were to assume this was a preemptive action, it left no impact whatsoever on our
*  military operations today, neither on its missiles, nor on its drones, nor on its fighters.
*  We'll have more on this story after headlines.
*  Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of arbitrarily detaining and torturing Palestinian healthcare
*  workers.
*  Eight doctors, nurses and paramedics recently held in Israeli prisons have described being
*  blindfolded, beaten, held in forced dress positions and handcuffed for extended periods
*  of time.
*  They also reported torture, including rape and sexual abuse, by Israeli forces.
*  Over the weekend, Israel bombed another school in Gaza, sheltering displaced Palestinians.
*  Meanwhile, on Saturday, an Israeli strike on Holmach and Yunis killed 11 members of
*  the same family, including two children.
*  Israeli forces have withdrawn from the Hamad city portion of Khan Yunis, leaving the neighborhood
*  largely destroyed.
*  Rescue workers recovered 16 bodies from the rubble.
*  Residents say they have no safe place to go.
*  RANDI RUBIK, Israeli President
*  We are a safe area.
*  There is no safety.
*  Where is safety?
*  We flee every day.
*  We get displaced every day under the rockets, under the bombing.
*  I am alone with my little children.
*  I flee with them every day from a place to another.
*  I don't know where to go.
*  They tell you about safe areas.
*  Where is safety?
*  Make me feel safe.
*  Make the little child feel safe.
*  We are tired people.
*  It's enough.
*  Have mercy on us.
*  AMY GOODMAN, The Washington Post
*  Hostage talks were held in Cairo, Egypt, over the weekend, but a deal has not been reached.
*  Egyptian officials said neither Hamas nor Israel agreed to a number of compromises
*  put forward by a mediator.
*  Hamas has said any deal must include a permanent ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from
*  Gaza.
*  At least three people died overnight in Ukraine as Russia launched a barrage of drone and
*  missile strikes targeting critical infrastructure, including power and water supplies across
*  Ukraine.
*  The attacks come a day after five Russian civilians were killed in a Ukrainian strike
*  on the Russian city of Belgarod.
*  Meanwhile, in the Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk, a safety adviser working for the Reuters
*  news agency was killed, and four Reuters journalists were injured in a Russian strike on their
*  hotel on Saturday.
*  Ryan Evans was a 38-year-old British citizen.
*  In a statement, Reuters said, quote,
*  "...Ryan has helped so many of our journalists cover events around the world.
*  We will miss him terribly," unquote.
*  The injured journalists are reportedly from Ukraine, the United States, Latvia and Germany.
*  Two of them were hospitalized.
*  Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with President Volodymyr Zelensky
*  in Kiev on Friday.
*  Modi called for peace talks to end the war.
*  No conflict can be resolved on the battlefield.
*  The road to resolution can only be found through dialogue and diplomacy.
*  And we should move in that direction without wasting any time.
*  Both sides should sit together to find ways to end this crisis.
*  In news from Iraq, two journalists were killed on Friday in a Turkish drone strike.
*  The journalists, Gulistan Tara of Turkey and Hira Bahadin of Iraq, worked for the Kurdish
*  outlet Starik TV.
*  A third journalist was seriously wounded.
*  Another journalist working for a Kurdish outlet was killed last month.
*  Without Borders says Iraqi Kurdistan is becoming one of the most dangerous areas in the world
*  for reporters.
*  In U.S. election news, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has suspended, though not ended, his independent
*  presidential campaign and endorsed Donald Trump.
*  The two campaigned together on Friday in Arizona.
*  Kennedy's brothers and sisters have publicly criticized his decision.
*  They said, quote,
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the son of Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of President John F.
*  Kennedy, both of whom were assassinated in the 1960s.
*  On Friday, Donald Trump vowed, if elected, to launch a commission on presidential assassinations
*  and attempts.
*  And they will also conduct a rigorous review of the attack last month.
*  But I tell you, I have never had more people ask me, please, sir, release the documents
*  on the Kennedy assassination.
*  And we're going to do that.
*  In other election news, Kamala Harris's campaign is reported she set a new record by raising
*  $540 million over the past month since President Biden suspended his reelection bid.
*  Harris and her running mate Tim Walz will launch a Georgia bus tour on Wednesday.
*  Donald Trump's golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, is hosting a January 6 awards
*  gala next week, when organizers plan to honor 20 defendants arrested for taking part in
*  the deadly January 6 insurrection.
*  Donald Trump is listed as an invited speaker to the gala.
*  Meanwhile, a Maryland man who threw a smoke bomb at police on January 6 has been convicted
*  on a number of charges, including civil disorder and assaulting police.
*  Justin Lee, who became a police officer after the insurrection, will be sentenced on November
*  6.
*  The U.S. Department of Justice and eight states have sued the property management software
*  company RealPage, accusing the firm of helping landlords collude to drive up the cost of
*  rent.
*  The firm collects rental information from competing corporate landlords and then uses
*  algorithms to set rents.
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland accused the firm of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act.
*  When the Sherman Act was passed, an anti-competitive scheme might have looked like robber barons
*  shaking hands at a secret meeting.
*  Today, it looks like landlords using mathematical algorithms to align their rents.
*  In Kentucky, a federal judge has thrown out felony charges against two former Louisville
*  police officers connected with the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor in her own home
*  over four years ago.
*  The two officers had been accused of falsifying a warrant that led to the fatal police raid
*  on Taylor's apartment.
*  The officers, Joshua Janes and Kyle Meany, were not at the scene of the shooting in March
*  2020.
*  We'll have more on this later in the broadcast.
*  We'll be speaking with Taylor family attorney Ben Crump.
*  In Tennessee, a second former Memphis police officer is pleaded guilty in the police killing
*  of Tyree Nichols, a 29-year-old black father who died after a brutal police beating.
*  The former officer, Emmett Martin, pleaded guilty to federal civil rights violations
*  and could face up to 40 years in prison.
*  In Florida, a sheriff's deputy has been charged with manslaughter in connection with
*  the killing of Roger Fortson, a 23-year-old black Air Force member who was shot to death
*  in his own home.
*  According to the Associated Press, former Ocaloosa County Deputy Eddie Duran is just
*  the fourth Florida police officer in the past 35 years to be charged for an on-duty
*  killing.
*  French authorities have detained the founder and CEO of the popular news and messaging
*  service Telegram.
*  Pavel Durov was detained at a Paris airport on an arrest warrant related to allegations
*  that Telegram has been used for illegal activity.
*  Durov is a dual French-Russian citizen.
*  Telegram posted a message online saying, quote,
*  "'It's absurd to claim that a platform, or its owner, are responsible for abuse of
*  that platform.
*  Almost a billion users globally use Telegram as means of communication and as a source
*  of vital information,' unquote.
*  The app has a history of refusing to cooperate with law enforcement."
*  Embraquina Faso, a militant group with links to Al-Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for
*  to 200 people and injured 140.
*  According to the Norwegian Refugee Council, attacks in Embraquina Faso this year have
*  killed more than 8,400 people.
*  At least 13 migrants are dead after their boats sank off the coast of Yemen.
*  Authorities are searching for over a dozen others who've been missing since last week,
*  according to the International Organization for Migration, the IOM.
*  The boat had departed from Djibouti in East Africa, carrying 25 Ethiopian and two Yemeni
*  migrants.
*  Annually, tens of thousands of migrants depart from the Horn of Africa, fleeing conflict,
*  extreme poverty and the impacts of the climate crisis, setting off on a dangerous journey
*  across the Red Sea, many with the hope of reaching wealthier nations in the Gulf.
*  In Norway, climate activists with the group Extinction Rebellion blocked an oil terminal
*  at a major gas processing plant Saturday.
*  Now we are outside the Karstø Oil Terminal.
*  We've just begun a blockade of one of Norway's largest processing plants for gas in the North
*  Sea.
*  So, we demand a plan for a phasing out of oil and gas production in Norway, because
*  oil and gas are killing the planet and several billion people are in danger of losing their
*  lives if we cannot manage to remain under the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming.
*  Here in New York, dozens of feminist climate activists were arrested outside the Manhattan
*  home of city CEO Jane Fraser.
*  The action was part of Summer of Heat, a season-long series of civil disobedience targeting the
*  funders of the climate crisis.
*  And the Biden administration has been dealt a setback in its efforts to use the Civil
*  Rights Act of 1964 to fight environmental injustice in Louisiana.
*  On Friday, a federal court ruled the Environmental Protection Agency is barred from using the
*  federal civil rights law to prevent Louisiana from issuing permits to new fossil fuel facilities
*  in an area known as Cancer Alley, a predominantly black community.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
