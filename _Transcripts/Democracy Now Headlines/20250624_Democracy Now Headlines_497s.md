Today’s mayoral primary in New York City features two very different frontrunners, the scandal-ridden former governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, and the young Democratic Socialist state assemblymember, Zohran Mamdani. Mamdani’s ascendant grassroots campaign has taken the Democratic establishment by surprise. He last appeared on Democracy Now! in October, as he launched his campaign centered on bringing down the high cost-of-living for working-class New Yorkers. On the campaign trail today, he joins us again as polls place him neck-and-neck with Cuomo, to share why his campaign and candidacy has resonated with so many. “This race is one way in which we can show that we can actually deliver a city that New Yorkers can afford, and we can do so by building a movement the city has never seen before.”

# NYC Mayoral Primary Day: Zohran Mamdani on Building a Movement & Campaigning for an Affordable City
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Juan González. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=3.06s)]
*  Today, New York City Democrats are voting in an historic mayoral primary. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=5.28s)]
*  For much of the race, the 67-year-old former governor, Andrew Cuomo, was seen as the clear [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=10.84s)]
*  frontrunner. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=16.48s)]
*  Cuomo resigned four years ago over allegations he sexually harassed at least 11 women while [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=17.48s)]
*  in office. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=23.46s)]
*  But polls show the race has become extremely tight. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=24.64s)]
*  The possible new frontrunner, according to some polls, is a 33-year-old Democratic Socialist [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=28.88s)]
*  State Assembly member, Zohran Mamdani. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  He has risen to the top tier of a crowded field of 11 candidates in which voters will [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=39.2s)]
*  use a rank-choice voting system to choose five candidates in order of their preference. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  A coalition of progressive groups has called on voters to not rank Cuomo. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=50.4s)]
*  Last October, Mamdani joined Democracy Now! as he launched his mayoral campaign and laid [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=56.24s)]
*  out the platform he's now known for. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  Today, he joins us on the phone from the campaign trail for a few minutes before we look broadly [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=64.08s)]
*  at this historic race. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=71.2s)]
*  Zohran Mamdani, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=74.08s)]
*  You held a news conference this morning in your home district of Astoria at sunrise? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=77.28s)]
*  Yes, yes, I did, because that's the time that many New Yorkers are getting up to go [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=84.16s)]
*  to work so they deserve a mayor who will be ready just like they are. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=88.0s)]
*  And so, talk about what your message is today and how you think it is that you have eaten [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=91.52s)]
*  into something like a 40 percent lead that the disgraced former governor, Andrew Cuomo, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=97.88s)]
*  had, and now some polls are putting you ahead. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=103.76s)]
*  Well, Amy, it's the same message that we've had since we launched this campaign on October [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=107.16s)]
*  23rd, eight months ago, and it was such a pleasure to do so at Democracy Now! and sharing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  our vision for a city that New Yorkers can actually afford. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  Affordability is the crisis of this five boroughs across our city, where we live in the wealthiest [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  city in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, and yet one in four New Yorkers [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=128.08s)]
*  are living in poverty. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  Five hundred thousand children are going to sleep hungry every night, and the rest are [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=133.32s)]
*  in a permanent state of anxiety as to whether they can continue to afford to pay their rent, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=138.44s)]
*  to pay their child care, to even afford the cost of groceries. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=143.04s)]
*  And ultimately, what has powered our campaigns rise from one percent in the polls to being [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=146.68s)]
*  just a hair's breadth away from City Hall. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=152.8s)]
*  Is this focus on an economic agenda that will deliver a New York City that working and middle [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=155.64s)]
*  class New Yorkers can actually afford? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=161.04s)]
*  And how have you been able to build such a large campaign apparatus, despite the fact [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=165.16s)]
*  that most of the, quote, establishment of democratic operators, the unions and the and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=170.36s)]
*  the political leaders have not backed you? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=176.8s)]
*  You know, I think it's been incredible to see how the very New Yorkers who have been [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  left behind by the politics of our city and of today have been the ones that are powering [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=185.88s)]
*  our campaigns rise. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=192.16s)]
*  I now speak to you with more than 50,000 volunteers. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  There was a point at the beginning of this race where there were some that doubted whether [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  we would receive even 50,000 votes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=201.12s)]
*  And yet this this campaign apparatus, of which I cannot think of a precedent in our city, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=202.92s)]
*  is one that has now knocked on one point five million doors, made more than five hundred [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=208.84s)]
*  thousand phone calls and ultimately is carrying a belief in politics that should require no [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  translation, a politics that speaks directly to working in middle class New Yorker struggles [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=219.48s)]
*  and one that so often is being shared directly by one New Yorker to another at a doorstep [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=224.76s)]
*  or a subway platform or in a park. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=230.92s)]
*  Because too often we've allowed politics to become something where we wait for New Yorkers [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=233.2s)]
*  to come to us or we lecture them instead of listen to them. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  And what we have done instead is reach out to New Yorkers wherever they are across these [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=240.48s)]
*  five boroughs. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  And of course, this is the Democratic primary that we're dealing with today. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=246.68s)]
*  And it looks like the general election in November will be a lot different as well, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=252.52s)]
*  given the fact that even Andrew Cuomo, if he were not to prevail, is going to run as [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=256.84s)]
*  an independent, that the current mayor, Eric Adams, is also running as an independent. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=261.16s)]
*  Do you see this as if you prevail today to be a guarantee of victory or you have a lot [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=266.28s)]
*  more campaigning to do in the months ahead? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=273.0s)]
*  We got here by never taking any day for granted. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=277.32s)]
*  And that's how we're going to run the rest of this race. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=280.2s)]
*  And we're confident that we'll win the primary and then we'll run the general in the same [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=282.2s)]
*  manner, just as hungry as New Yorkers are for a new city, a city that takes care of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=285.72s)]
*  each and every person. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=290.36s)]
*  And ultimately, I've been running against Eric Adams a second term from the beginning [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=292.04s)]
*  of this race. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=295.72s)]
*  And Andrew Cuomo is running for that same term. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=296.72s)]
*  It's the same corruption, the same donors, the same limited vision funded by the very [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=298.6s)]
*  corporations that are benefiting from this inequality crisis in the city. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  And we are on the brink of defeating that second term in the primary. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=308.44s)]
*  And we'll do it again in the general. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=311.32s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about the New York Times saying they weren't going to endorse anyone [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  in this primary and then went after you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=317.79999999999995s)]
*  They said, We do not believe Mr. Mamdani deserves a spot on New Yorkers ballots. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  He is experienced, is too thin. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=325.96s)]
*  His agenda reads like a turbocharged version of Mr. de Blasio's dismaying mayoralty. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  As for Mr. Cuomo, we have serious objections to with Essex and conduct, even if he would [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=333.8s)]
*  be better for New York's future than Mr. Mamdani. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  They went after you about controlling rent. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  They went after you about grocery stores. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=344.92s)]
*  Talk about what you have promised New Yorkers on all of these issues and why you think the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=348.04s)]
*  Times is wrong. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  And do you actually think them going after you helps you? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=354.68s)]
*  You know, I think that their opinions are those of, you know, about a dozen New Yorkers, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  and they certainly have the right to it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=363.24s)]
*  And this is an election that will be decided by closer to a million New Yorkers. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=364.68s)]
*  And ultimately, I was proud that when the New York Times assembled a panel of experts, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=368.76s)]
*  they rated our campaign. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=374.04s)]
*  It came to house of life. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  And those are two of the issues at the forefront of most New Yorkers minds in this election. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  And ultimately, our platform has been one laser focused on that economic agenda in our [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  promises to freeze the rent for more than 2 million rent stabilized tenants, to make [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=390.2s)]
*  the slowest buses in the country fast and free, and to deliver universal child care. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=394.92s)]
*  Because ultimately, these are the ways in which city government can make life that little bit [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=399.24s)]
*  easier for each and every New Yorker and finally own up to the tools that it already has, as [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=403.8s)]
*  opposed to pretend that it is merely a spectator in a suffocating cost of living crisis. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=409.4s)]
*  And finally, in about a minute that we have left, the last few mayoral [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=414.52s)]
*  democratic primaries have been marked by a very low participation level. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=417.96s)]
*  What's your sense of the turnout for this election? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=422.59999999999997s)]
*  I can tell you just from the early voting numbers that it is very exciting to see so [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=427.96s)]
*  many more New Yorkers participate in this process. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=431.96s)]
*  From the beginning of this race, we've said we wanted to bring more people into our politics [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  such that our election is look more like the city that we love. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=438.84s)]
*  And we're seeing so many New Yorkers, be they younger New Yorkers or New Yorkers who've lived [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=442.03999999999996s)]
*  here for decades but have never registered to vote, finally seeing themselves in our politics, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=446.68s)]
*  in our policies. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=451.24s)]
*  And ultimately, we know the importance of this is because the democracy is not just under attack [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=452.44s)]
*  from an authoritarian administration in Washington. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=458.12s)]
*  It's also under attack from within in a withering belief in its relevance to the struggles of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  everyday people. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=465.8s)]
*  And ultimately, this race is one way in which we can show that we can actually deliver a city [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  that New Yorkers can afford, and we can do so by building a movement the city has never seen before. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VXGMNtkci0&t=472.44s)]
