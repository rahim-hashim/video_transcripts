The new documentary The Encampments, produced by Watermelon Pictures and BreakThrough News, is an insider's look at the student protest movement to demand divestment from the U.S. and Israeli weapons industry and an end to the genocide in Gaza. The film focuses on last year's student encampment at Columbia University and features student leaders including Mahmoud Khalil, who was chosen by the university as a liaison between the administration and students. Khalil, a U.S. permanent resident, has since been arrested and detained by immigration enforcement as part of the Trump administration's attempt to deport immigrants who exercise their right to free speech and protest. "Columbia has gone to every extent to try to censor this movement," says Munir Atalla, a producer for the film and a former film professor at Columbia. 

We speak with Atalla; Sueda Polat, a Columbia graduate student and fellow campus negotiator with Khalil; and Grant Miner, a former Columbia graduate student and president of the student workers' union who was expelled from the school over his participation in the protests. "Functionally, I was expelled for speaking out against genocide," Miner says. All three of our guests emphasize their continued commitment to pro-Palestine activism even in the face of increasing institutional repression. The Encampments is opening nationwide in April.

*  graduate student protest negotiator who was seized by federal agents three weeks ago and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=25.52s)]
*  remains locked up in an ICE jail in Louisiana. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=31.2s)]
*  There is a court hearing for him today in New Jersey. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=36.32s)]
*  This is a clip of Mahmoud Khalil from the documentary. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=39.92s)]
*  I was approached the night of the encampment that I would be the person communicating with [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=45.08s)]
*  the administration. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=51.96s)]
*  The organizers trusted me, given my background, in terms of like working in diplomacy, either [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=54.28s)]
*  at the British Embassy or here at the UN. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=60.0s)]
*  We discussed who's best to support me and we felt that Swede is the perfect person. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  The university wanted to shut down the encampment in any way that it could. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  When it first started, they were like, let's not let them bring in water, let's shut down [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=75.08s)]
*  all of the gates, let's not let them bring in tents, let's not let them bring in blankets, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=78.32s)]
*  because it was cold, it was freezing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=82.64s)]
*  They underestimated the will of the students. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=85.08s)]
*  They literally like feel that these are just kids. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  Through my conversation, I just felt how much the university is detached from reality. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=92.48s)]
*  What university in the world want to invest in weapon manufacturers? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=98.24s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=101.6s)]
*  You're concerned with education. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=102.6s)]
*  Like we're literally giving you back the university to be a moral university. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=104.84s)]
*  Every time in the negotiations, when we told them that, they would say like, oh, you're [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=111.08s)]
*  overestimating your power or your influence. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=114.96s)]
*  But then after the fourth day, they were just like so silent, because clearly it's a global [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=117.64s)]
*  movement. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=123.28s)]
*  I remember like telling him like, at this point, there are 60 universities sitting up [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=124.28s)]
*  encampments across the United States. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=129.0s)]
*  They're just like waiting to hear what would happen at Columbia. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=131.04s)]
*  It was Mahmoud Khalil, the graduate student protest organizer and negotiator with the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=136.04s)]
*  university, who's in this film featured in the encampments. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=143.88s)]
*  We're joined now by three guests. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=148.24s)]
*  Munir Attala is the producer of the encampments, head of production acquisitions at Watermelon [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=150.12s)]
*  Pictures. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=154.16s)]
*  He was a Columbia adjunct professor of film last spring. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  Grant Miner is also with us, the president of the Student Workers of Columbia, UAW 2710, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=160.16s)]
*  He was expelled by Columbia for taking part in the pro-Palestine campus protests. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=166.2s)]
*  He was fired as a graduate worker one day before his union entered bargaining talks. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=172.0s)]
*  He's president of the local UAW at Columbia. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=178.0s)]
*  And Sueda Polat is with us, graduate student in human rights at Columbia University, along [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=181.52s)]
*  with Mahmoud. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=186.26s)]
*  She negotiated between the student activists and the Columbia administration. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=187.5s)]
*  Sueda, I want to begin with you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=191.0s)]
*  It's also where the film begins, very movingly, as you talk about why you even came to Columbia [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=192.96s)]
*  as a graduate student in human rights, that that's not a common major. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=198.8s)]
*  It most definitely isn't a common major. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  This is my graduate degree. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=206.68s)]
*  Prior to that, I was in sociology. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=208.4s)]
*  But before starting at Columbia University, I spent some time in Palestine, particularly [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=210.12s)]
*  in the West Bank. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=214.08s)]
*  And I think it was just seeing the strangulation of life in Palestine, the squashing of people [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=215.8s)]
*  and the regular indignities that they've been exposed to in their everyday life, I think [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=222.88000000000002s)]
*  was a very transformative political moment for me. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=228.72s)]
*  And upon returning from the West Bank, I knew I wanted to work on the Palestinian liberation [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  movement. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=235.84s)]
*  And in the United States, Columbia University had the strongest record, particularly for [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=236.84s)]
*  Palestine, with the Center for Palestine Studies, as well as being a host for so many scholars [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  of Palestine, of Edward Said, of Joseph Masad, and so many other professors. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  And it was also known as being a protest school. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=251.24s)]
*  And I felt that it would be the right fit, but I was sorely mistaken. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=253.84s)]
*  So how did you end up being a chief negotiator between the students and the university, along [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=258.04s)]
*  with Mahmoud? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=264.36s)]
*  So the two of you worked side by side as you met with the administration. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=265.36s)]
*  I think the first few days of the encampment particularly were very confusing for a lot [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=270.36s)]
*  of people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=274.02s)]
*  On the first night of the first encampment prior to the arrest is when the administration [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=276.64s)]
*  first reached out wanting to talk about what our demands were. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  At the time, like Mahmoud said in the documentary, he had a lot of experience in diplomacy, but [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=285.44s)]
*  he didn't want to go in alone. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=289.32s)]
*  And some of my friends recommended me to meet with the administration with him. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=291.28s)]
*  And what do you mean he had experience in diplomacy? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=294.64s)]
*  I mean, he's been working at the Palestine Mission at the United Nations. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=296.44s)]
*  He's at SIPA, where he studies a lot of diplomacy, international relations. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=301.08s)]
*  The School of International Affairs at Columbia. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=305.47999999999996s)]
*  Yes, the School of International Affairs at Columbia University. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=307.84s)]
*  And he's also, you know, he's 30 years old. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=309.64s)]
*  He's very experienced. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  He's a diplomat through and through, so he was a good choice. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=314.08s)]
*  So I want to go to another clip from the film, Encampments. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=317.44s)]
*  The genocide didn't start on October 7th. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=324.08s)]
*  Neither did the pro-possity movement generally on campus. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=326.76s)]
*  The police had already pushed like divestment referendums. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=329.6s)]
*  In previous years, we had voted on divestment referendums at various colleges within Columbia. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=331.64s)]
*  All of them passed. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=337.0s)]
*  The guys have it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=338.76s)]
*  Immediately, the president sent out an email saying, we don't have actual general consensus [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=345.76s)]
*  amongst the student body or amongst our community, in which they include in the community the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=350.52s)]
*  Columbia alumni. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=356.28s)]
*  Free, free Palestine! [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=358.0s)]
*  Free, free Palestine! [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=360.0s)]
*  Free, free, free Palestine! [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=362.0s)]
*  Free, free, free Palestine! [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=364.0s)]
*  What do we want? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=366.0s)]
*  Justice! [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=368.0s)]
*  What do we want? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=370.0s)]
*  Now! [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=372.0s)]
*  We had done everything we could think of. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=373.0s)]
*  We did peaceful protest that was ignored. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=375.0s)]
*  We did strategic interruptions that was ignored and punished. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=377.0s)]
*  Students had written up this whole divestment proposal saying that it is not only possible [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=381.0s)]
*  but would be easy and that was just dismissed out of hand. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=386.72s)]
*  They changed all the protest rules. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=389.72s)]
*  They wouldn't approve any of our events. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=391.72s)]
*  They would just criminalize anyone who would participate in a protest. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=394.72s)]
*  If they were just going to ignore us, then we had to do something that couldn't possibly [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=399.72s)]
*  be ignored by the administration. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=402.72s)]
*  Another clip from the encampments, and one of the voices there was Grant Miner, the president [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=405.72s)]
*  of Student Workers of Columbia, U.A.W. 2710. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=410.72s)]
*  He's been fired and expelled. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=413.44000000000005s)]
*  A fifth-year grad student, Grant. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=415.44000000000005s)]
*  You're also Jewish-American. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=417.44000000000005s)]
*  Can you talk about why you've participated in this and address directly the issue of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=419.44000000000005s)]
*  somehow the encampments creating an anti-Semitic environment? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=425.44000000000005s)]
*  When Democracy Now! went to cover it, so many of the students involved were Jewish students. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=429.44000000000005s)]
*  Yes, I mean, why I participated in it, I mean, there's a number of reasons. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=435.44000000000005s)]
*  I'm a labor organizer. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=439.44000000000005s)]
*  It's really important to our members that we had a firm stance on this. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=441.16s)]
*  It's our social justice union, U.A.W. more broadly, practices social justice unionism. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=446.16s)]
*  And you're a graduate instructor. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=452.16s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=454.16s)]
*  And so it was important that we were there. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=455.16s)]
*  I think as a Jewish person as well, it was important to me that we be visible in the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=457.15999999999997s)]
*  Palestine movement. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=465.15999999999997s)]
*  And I guess to address the sort of specter of anti-Semitism in the encampments, I mean, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=466.88000000000005s)]
*  to be honest with you, it's just not something I've ever experienced in the Palestine movement. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=471.88000000000005s)]
*  The encampments in particular were enormously welcoming. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=476.88000000000005s)]
*  We had services. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=479.88000000000005s)]
*  The encampments coincided with Passover. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=481.88000000000005s)]
*  There were actually members of the Jewish Studies faculty that would come into the encampment [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=483.88s)]
*  and speak and be in community with Jewish students. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=489.88s)]
*  I wanted to go to another clip of the encampments with the Jewish student protesters at Columbia [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=493.6s)]
*  and their allies taking part in a havdalah service. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=498.6s)]
*  The clip features the Israeli-American rabbi, Avie Stein. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=500.6s)]
*  We are here, and if anyone here disagrees with me, you can't tell me. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=513.6s)]
*  But I think we are here because we are Jews, not just because we happen to be, because [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=516.6s)]
*  we are Jews. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=522.32s)]
*  We are Jews who are part of who we are. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=523.32s)]
*  To fight for liberation of every human being, to know that every human being is a divine [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=525.32s)]
*  image. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=529.32s)]
*  That is what we're doing right now. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=530.32s)]
*  And we are separating ourselves from people who are somehow incapable of seeing that. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=532.32s)]
*  We are fighting for the divine spark for the tel ameluhim in every person. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=537.32s)]
*  You are all so amazing. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=543.32s)]
*  And it's an honor to be here with you. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=545.32s)]
*  If you're familiar with the havdalah service, please sing loudly and proudly. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=548.0400000000001s)]
*  If you're not, please sing loudly and proudly. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  It's very Jewish to not know the words and not know everything, but you'll catch on. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=554.0400000000001s)]
*  Another clip from the encampments. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=572.0400000000001s)]
*  Grant, you have just been expelled. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=575.76s)]
*  That's not just losing your job. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=578.76s)]
*  That's your five years that you've been a graduate student. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=580.76s)]
*  You are not getting your Ph.D. On what grounds were you expelled? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=584.26s)]
*  I was expelled for participating in pro-Palestinian protests. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=588.26s)]
*  I mean, functionally, I was expelled for speaking out against genocide. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=592.26s)]
*  And, you know, it was really shocking. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=595.26s)]
*  I mean, I learned this as I was away doing research on a departmental grant. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=598.26s)]
*  And it was tough to learn that Columbia was more than willing to just totally concede to Trump [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=603.48s)]
*  to throw its students under the bus, to throw international students, especially under the bus, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=610.48s)]
*  just to get back some money and to please the administration. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=615.48s)]
*  I mean, this is a very frightening time. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=620.48s)]
*  You not only have Mahmoud, who is jailed in Louisiana. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=622.48s)]
*  You have another student who has left the country because her visa was revoked, this star student. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=627.7s)]
*  Munir Attala, you are the producer of the encampments. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=635.7s)]
*  It's opening in New York, Los Angeles next week and beyond? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=639.7s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=644.7s)]
*  This is a film that's going to be opening here in New York this weekend, and then we'll take it nationwide next weekend. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=645.7s)]
*  Already, the demand has been very strong. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=651.7s)]
*  I think people are eager to see the encampments from within, from the student perspective. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=653.9200000000001s)]
*  Most of the coverage of the encampments to date has been from people who actually never even set foot on the encampments. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=658.9200000000001s)]
*  Whereas for us, you know, I was an adjunct professor at Columbia last spring, and we witnessed the student movement. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=664.9200000000001s)]
*  So you're teaching film there. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=671.9200000000001s)]
*  Right, yeah, exactly. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=673.9200000000001s)]
*  Actually a lab and documentary production. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=674.9200000000001s)]
*  And some of our students even chose to cover this as part of their work. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=676.9200000000001s)]
*  But, you know, what we witnessed... [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=680.9200000000001s)]
*  We saw many of the Columbia journalism students say it was quite something what they were doing. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=683.14s)]
*  They had a little more access than other reporters because the university had shut down the campus. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=687.14s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean Columbia has gone to every extent to try and censor this movement and be really a leader in repressing it as well. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=693.14s)]
*  Let's not forget this was the largest student movement in U.S. history. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=701.14s)]
*  And, you know, the students have always been on the right side of history. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=705.14s)]
*  Columbia's own history shows that. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=709.36s)]
*  They were on the right side in the 1960s during the Civil Rights Movement. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=711.36s)]
*  They were on the right side in the 90s in the fight against apartheid. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=714.36s)]
*  I wish Juan was joining me in this conversation. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=717.36s)]
*  Juan Gonzalez, our co-anchor of Democracy Now!, because he participated in the Columbia 1968. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=720.36s)]
*  Basically you could say encampment, occupation, and you go back and forth in the film. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=728.36s)]
*  That's right, you know. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=733.36s)]
*  Just as the students stood on the right side of history in the past, so too are they standing on the right side of history today. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=735.58s)]
*  And their demands for a disclosure of financial assets, their demand for Columbia to invest its multi-billion dollar endowment from arms companies, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=741.58s)]
*  is not only a righteous and just demand, but it is inevitable. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=750.58s)]
*  And the sooner Columbia sees that, the more embarrassment and shame it can save itself. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=754.58s)]
*  You know, can you even call Columbia a university anymore? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=759.58s)]
*  A university has the obligation to protect its students. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=762.8000000000001s)]
*  A university has the obligation to stand by the core values of academic institutions, freedom of expression and speech. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYd_CWiuv8&t=765.8000000000001s)]
