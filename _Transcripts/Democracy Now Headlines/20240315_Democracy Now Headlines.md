# Top U.S. & World Headlines — March 15, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [March 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISt386mYfvY)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israeli forces killed at least 29 people in Gaza on Thursday in two separate attacks as
*  they waited for humanitarian aid.
*  The latest massacre struck Palestinians in northern Gaza City and at the Al Nusraath
*  camp in central Gaza.
*  Today, with no warning, they attacked this warehouse.
*  Though the center is empty of militants or security guards or police even that may threaten
*  Israel's security, we got the aid and we distribute to people.
*  The people need to come and get their Ramadan meals.
*  Today, they hit the warehouse and burnt all the aid, including the dates.
*  Also, the blood of the people who work here fill the place.
*  Even before yesterday's massacre, Gaza officials reported Israeli forces have killed more than
*  400 Palestinians as they wait for aid deliveries.
*  Hamas has reportedly proposed a ceasefire deal, which includes the release of hostages
*  in exchange for 700 to 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza and the
*  return of forcibly displaced Palestinians to their homes.
*  Elsewhere, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas appointed longtime economic adviser Mohammed
*  Mustafa as the Palestinian Authority's new prime minister Thursday.
*  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer offered his most scathing condemnation of Prime Minister
*  Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right government, calling for new elections in Israel.
*  He spoke from the Senate floor.
*  If Prime Minister Netanyahu's current coalition remains in power after the war begins to wind
*  down and continues to pursue dangerous and inflammatory policies that test existing U.S.
*  standards for assistance, then the United States will have no choice but to play a more
*  active role in shaping Israeli policy by using our leverage to change the present course.
*  Senator Schumer is a staunch defender of Israel and the highest-ranking elected Jewish American
*  lawmaker.
*  Meanwhile, the Biden administration imposed sanctions on two Israeli settler outposts
*  and three individual settlers in the occupied West Bank who have harassed and attacked Palestinians.
*  In South Africa, Naledi Pandur, minister of international relations and cooperation,
*  warned South African citizens they will face prosecution if they serve in the Israeli military
*  as it commits war crimes in Gaza.
*  Pandur said,
*  When you come home, we're going to arrest you.
*  Here in New York, over 100 activists were arrested Thursday after occupying the lobby
*  of The New York Times in the latest protest against the paper's coverage of Israel's
*  war on Gaza.
*  One man was filmed harassing a group of protesters and ripping away a banner that read,
*  Lies.
*  This came just hours after a separate early morning protest which blocked trucks from
*  accessing and picking up newspapers at the Times printing facility in Queens.
*  Some of the demonstrators laid out a pile of rubble on the road and placed a sign that
*  read,
*  Consent for genocide is manufactured here.
*  In Canada, a growing list of over a thousand alumni, faculty, staff and others from Montreal's
*  McGill University signed an open letter in solidarity with students on hunger strike
*  to demand McGill divest from companies arming Israel and impose an academic boycott in Israel
*  over its genocide in Gaza and occupation of Palestinian land.
*  This is hunger striker Shadi explaining why they joined the peaceful action despite facing
*  personal health challenges.
*  I see and hear about all the people in Gaza who are disabled and chronically ill and they
*  don't get to opt out of the starvation of the bombs and of the genocide.
*  I think of Yazan al-Kafarna who was starved by the I.O.F. right?
*  And I think of Gaza's deaf children's center that got destroyed a few days ago and
*  I don't think I can sit this one out.
*  In more protest news, prominent writers including Naomi Klein, Michelle Alexander, Hisham Mattar,
*  Isabel Lechamad and Zehna Arafat announced they will not participate in this year's
*  Penn World Voices Festival for failing to appropriately respond, they said, to Israel's
*  genocide in Gaza.
*  The authors write, quote,
*  Israel's killed nearly 100 academics and writers.
*  If organizations like PEN America cling to the illusion of political neutrality in the
*  face of a clear effort to destroy Palestinian lives and culture, one can only wonder whether
*  there will be any writers left in Gaza to tell the story of their apocalypse or to trust
*  words and speech when the killing finally ends or any record left of the history they've
*  lived, they wrote.
*  At least 60 people, including children, are feared dead in the Mediterranean Sea after
*  departing Libya on a migrant vessel that went adrift en route to Europe.
*  The engine reportedly broke down, leaving the group lost at sea for days without food
*  and water.
*  Several others were rescued, many of them from Senegal, Mali and Gambia.
*  The humanitarian aid group SOS Mediterrane said it had rescued another 200 migrants headed
*  to Europe on a wooden boat in an overcrowded rubber dinghy.
*  According to the International Organization for Migration, 2,500 migrants died or went
*  missing in the Mediterranean last year as they attempted to reach Europe.
*  200 deaths have been recorded since the start of this year.
*  In Washington state, the immigrant rights group La Resistencia is reporting over 300
*  people have joined a hunger strike following the recent death of Charles Leo Daniel, a
*  61-year-old man from Trinidad and Tobago, and reports of several suicide attempts at
*  the troubled Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma.
*  Police have set up an encampment outside the jail as they and detained immigrants participate
*  in the peaceful action, demanding Northwest be shut down.
*  They're also calling for an independent investigation into Daniel's death, who was
*  found unresponsive while being held in solitary confinement earlier this month.
*  Northwest is run by the private company GeoGroup to see our recent interview with La Resistencia's
*  Marumoto Pibiel Pando, who's herself on hunger strike.
*  Go to democracynow.org.
*  Vice President Kamala Harris visited a Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Paul, Minnesota,
*  Thursday, in the first such official visit by a president or vice president.
*  The visit was part of Harris' Fight for Reproductive Freedom store, as the Biden campaign seeks
*  to capitalize on voter anger over the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade.
*  This is Vice President Harris.
*  The stories abound.
*  I have heard stories of—and have met with women who had miscarriages in toilets, women
*  who were being denied emergency care because the health care providers there at an emergency
*  room were afraid that because of the laws in their state that they could be criminalized,
*  sent to prison for providing health care.
*  We'll have more on Vice President Harris' visit after headlines.
*  In Michigan, a jury found James Crumbly guilty of involuntary manslaughter for failing to
*  prevent his teenage son from going on a shooting spree, which killed four students at Oxford
*  High in 2021.
*  James Crumbly's wife, Jennifer, was convicted on the same charges last month after prosecutors
*  successfully argued the couple ignored obvious warning signs and bought the gun for their
*  son.
*  It's the first time parents have been directly charged for deaths caused by their child in
*  a mass shooting.
*  They'll both be sentenced next month.
*  In California, authorities have released bodycam footage showing the moments before deputies
*  killed 15-year-old Ryan Gaynor, a black child with autism, holding a gardening tool at the
*  time.
*  Video of the second deputy to arrive shows just eight and a half seconds passed from
*  when he exited his vehicle to when he shot the teen.
*  Distraught family members can be heard asking,
*  "'Why did you shoot my baby?' and,
*  "'Where is your taser?'
*  The family's lawyer said at least two of the officers on the scene were familiar with
*  Ryan Gaynor and would have known he did not pose a threat.
*  And Senator Bernie Sanders has introduced legislation calling for a 32-hour work week.
*  Sanders said the proposal is not a radical idea and has countries and companies around
*  the world increasingly adopt shorter work weeks and record the same or, in many cases,
*  higher rates of productivity.
*  Sanders said technological advances have benefited corporations and CEOs while leaving out workers
*  and that AI threatens to further deepen this inequality.
*  On Thursday, a Senate panel held a hearing on the issue.
*  This is UAW President Sean Fain, who pushed for a 32-hour work week in his union's initial
*  contract demands to the Big Three automakers last fall.
*  But time, just like every precious resource in our society, is not freely given to the
*  working class.
*  Since the Industrial Revolution, we've seen productivity in our society skyrocket.
*  With the advance of technology, one worker is now doing what 12 workers used to do.
*  More profit is being squeezed out of every hour, every minute, and every second.
*  Who's going to act to fix this epidemic of lives dominated by work?
*  Are the employers going to act?
*  Will Congress act?
*  How can working-class peoples take back their lives and take back their time?
*  And those are some of the headlines.
