House Republicans have successfully pushed forward President Trump's budget proposals to slash Medicaid and food stamps, putting millions of low-income Americans at risk. Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a healthcare consumer advocacy organization, says the $715 billion reduction is "literally the biggest cut to the Medicaid program in history."

# The GOP War on Medicaid: 14 Million Could Lose Healthcare to Fund Tax Breaks for Rich

*  We'll be talking about that in a moment. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=16.68s)]
*  But first, we're going to turn to the issue of Medicaid, the massive Medicaid cuts that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=19.44s)]
*  are being proposed in the House. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  House Republicans have successfully pushed through proposals—have successfully pushed [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=28.24s)]
*  through proposals for Medicaid and nutrition assistance cuts as part of Trump's budget, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=35.0s)]
*  making his 2017 tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans permanent by taking away essential [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=43.56s)]
*  services for the rest of the country. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=50.32s)]
*  The changes would disproportionately impact children and people living under the poverty [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=52.68s)]
*  The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities estimates over 14 million people could be [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=56.76s)]
*  at risk of losing Medicaid over the next decade under the proposed requirements for recipients [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=61.92s)]
*  to work, volunteer or be enrolled in school for at least 80 hours a month. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=66.36s)]
*  For more, we're joined by Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a healthcare [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=70.64s)]
*  consumer advocacy organization. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=75.4s)]
*  Tell us, Anthony Wright, what has—what have the Republicans come to at this point? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=78.24s)]
*  What is this bill and the level, the number of millions of people who will be cut off [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  from Medicaid? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=91.28s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=92.28s)]
*  The proposal that passed the Energy and Commerce Committee just a day or two ago would cut [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=94.68s)]
*  $715 billion out of the Medicaid program over the next 10 years. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=100.92s)]
*  It's literally the biggest cut to the Medicaid program in history, which would—just the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  Medicaid cuts alone leave around 9 million Americans without coverage, and on top of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  other cuts and inaction and actions with regard to the Affordable Care Act would leave about [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=118.36s)]
*  14 million, at least 14 million Americans without coverage at the end of the term. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  So this is a massive cut. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=130.36s)]
*  It is—it removes people from coverage largely through bureaucratic barriers that, again, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=133.04s)]
*  the way of people getting on and staying on coverage, things like having to reapply not [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=139.56s)]
*  just every year but twice a year, things like work reporting requirements that tend to be [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=144.44s)]
*  so bureaucratic that people who are eligible, who are working, fall off the program, but [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=150.84s)]
*  also increase costs in terms of copays and just additional cuts to states and to providers [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=155.8s)]
*  that mean that that will impact the healthcare system that we all rely on. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=162.56s)]
*  I wanted to turn to the Republican Senator, Trump ally Josh Hawley. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=167.6s)]
*  Among those interestingly criticizing Republicans who want to cut Medicaid, he was speaking [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=173.08s)]
*  on MSNBC's Morning Joe. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=178.0s)]
*  Well, the right thing to do is not to cut Medicaid, so I'm glad to hear him say that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=179.8s)]
*  Manu, it ought to be just a basic foundational principle. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=184.4s)]
*  It is wrong to cut healthcare for the working poor. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=187.56s)]
*  And that's what we're talking about here with Medicaid. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=190.44s)]
*  My state is a Medicaid expansion state. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=192.2s)]
*  Over 20% of Missourians, including hundreds of thousands of children, are on Medicaid. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=194.66s)]
*  And Manu, they're not on Medicaid because they want to be. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=198.94s)]
*  They're on Medicaid because they cannot afford health insurance in the private market. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=201.54s)]
*  These are working people and their children who need healthcare. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=205.94s)]
*  And it's just wrong to go and cut their healthcare when they're trying to make ends meet, trying [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=210.1s)]
*  to help their kids, trying to make sure that they're able to provide for their families. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  So I hope that the House GOP and the Senate GOP will get the message here. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=217.66s)]
*  By the way, President Trump has said the same thing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=221.58s)]
*  No Medicaid benefit cuts. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=224.06s)]
*  So that was Josh Hawley actually speaking to Manu Raju on CNN. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=226.34s)]
*  This is Independent Senator Bernie Sanders calling the proposed cuts to Medicaid a, quote, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=230.22000000000003s)]
*  death sentence for millions who rely on it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=235.94s)]
*  He was on MSNBC. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=238.42000000000002s)]
*  We're going to be looking at $715 billion in cuts to Medicaid and to the Affordable Care [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=239.42000000000002s)]
*  Act. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=249.02s)]
*  That means, Chris, that over 13, according to the CBO, over 13 million Americans are [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=250.42s)]
*  going to lose their health insurance. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=257.3s)]
*  And then on top of that, what the Republicans are proposing is a $35 co-payment for many [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=259.7s)]
*  Medicaid recipients. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=268.18s)]
*  If you are making $16,000 a year, you know what? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=270.18s)]
*  You can't afford that 35 bucks. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=274.53999999999996s)]
*  You are not going to go to the doctor. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=276.86s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, very interesting that Hawley sounds like Sanders, who is a close [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=279.62s)]
*  Trump ally. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=284.74s)]
*  What is the significance of this divide in the Republican Party, Anthony Wright? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=285.94s)]
*  It is clear that there's many Republicans who understand the devastating impacts that [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=291.46000000000004s)]
*  this would have on their districts. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=297.94s)]
*  Many House Republican members have 25, 30 percent, and in some cases 50, even 60 percent, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=299.58000000000004s)]
*  of their constituents that get health coverage through the Medicaid program, and that would [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=307.7s)]
*  be cut. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=312.9s)]
*  A lot of Republican members represent rural areas, where rural hospitals will be particularly [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=313.9s)]
*  hard hit if one of the major financing streams is cut. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=318.82s)]
*  But they need money to pay for the tax cut that they're trying to move through in quick [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=324.02s)]
*  order. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=329.14s)]
*  We're talking about a $4.5 trillion tax cut for the wealthiest Americans? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=330.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=334.7s)]
*  And they're going to pay for that, part by increasing the deficit, but in part by [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=336.65999999999997s)]
*  making this massive cut, the biggest cut in history, to the Medicaid program, which is, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=340.46s)]
*  again, a key funding source for the healthcare system we all rely on—hospitals, clinics, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=346.53999999999996s)]
*  nursing homes, maternity wards—that all are at risk of scaling back services. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=351.38s)]
*  Some may even close as a result. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=357.26s)]
*  So, how are you organizing to stop something like 14 million Americans from losing Medicaid? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=358.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so, again, 14 million people will lose coverage. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=365.86s)]
*  But they have been activated. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=371.38s)]
*  There have been letters and protests of hundreds of organizations against these cuts. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=374.06s)]
*  There was an all-night marathon session where Democrats were proposing a series of amendments [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=379.9s)]
*  against these cuts. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=384.65999999999997s)]
*  They all were rejected. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=386.09999999999997s)]
*  But there was protesters in the hallways, folks in wheelchairs getting arrested. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=387.62s)]
*  And there's been protests across the country in front of Congressmembers' offices making [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=393.66s)]
*  this case that we should not be cutting healthcare for low- and working-class folks in order [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=399.22s)]
*  to pay a tax cut for the wealthiest in corporations. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=405.54s)]
*  And that's a message that needs to be breakthrough in the next few days, because literally they're [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=410.22s)]
*  planning to vote on this in the full House next week. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=416.42s)]
*  And the Republican message is they're trying to hone it as they lose around the issue of [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=420.09999999999997s)]
*  giving money from the poorest to the richest. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=424.7s)]
*  They're trying to say, we're just trying to rout out fraud. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=426.97999999999996s)]
*  Your final comment, Anthony Wright? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=431.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they say that they're going after waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=433.5s)]
*  But if they were doing that, this would look—this bill would look very different. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=438.97999999999996s)]
*  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has been very clear. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=443.97999999999996s)]
*  Americans would lose coverage. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=448.26s)]
*  More people would have increased costs in their premiums and cost sharing, both in Medicaid [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=450.34000000000003s)]
*  and through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=456.06s)]
*  And at the end of the day, we are cutting the hospitals, the clinics, the nursing homes [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=458.7s)]
*  that we all rely on. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=463.22s)]
*  And that's why folks need to tell their congressmember what they think about these [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=465.54s)]
*  cuts in the next few days. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lysPQ-t5hLk&t=469.9s)]
