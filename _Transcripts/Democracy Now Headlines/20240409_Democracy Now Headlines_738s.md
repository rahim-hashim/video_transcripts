**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EnRx7lJHo8)
*  AMY GOODMAN, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Palestinian media say airstrikes hit two homes in Gaza City's Zaitoun neighborhood earlier
*  today, killing and injuring dozens of people.
*  Other attacks were reported in other Gaza City neighborhoods, including Shijaya and
*  Sabra.
*  This comes as negotiations in Egypt continue.
*  Hamas says the latest ceasefire proposal does not meet its demands, but that it's
*  continuing to review the plan, which includes a six-week pause in fighting and the exchange
*  of 40 Israeli hostages for at least 700 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
*  While Hamas is demanding Israel end its assault on Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*  warned on Monday that Israel has set a date to invade Ra'a.
*  Today, I received a report on the talks in Cairo.
*  We are constantly working to achieve our goals, first and foremost, the release of all of
*  our hostages and achieving a complete victory over Hamas.
*  The victory requires entry into Ra'a and the elimination of the terrorist battalions
*  there.
*  It will happen.
*  There is a date.
*  Displaced Palestinians have been returning to Chanyounis, after Israel withdrew from the
*  decimated southern city.
*  One woman, Um Ayed Al-Najjar, said normally she would be preparing for Eid celebrations
*  at this time of year as she took in the ruins of her home.
*  Our house was good and had everything.
*  I lacked nothing.
*  I lived happily with my husband, and our daughter's children used to live with us, too.
*  There's no Eid for me.
*  I have no desire to celebrate or do anything.
*  I'll just sit in front of my house like this.
*  We won't go anywhere.
*  And many of our family members were martyred.
*  They're still uncovering the bodies.
*  Praise God.
*  Who wants to celebrate?
*  Every house has wounded or martyrs.
*  The U.N. Security Council will make a formal decision on Palestine's bid for full U.N.
*  membership this month.
*  Palestine initially submitted its application for U.N. admission in 2011.
*  This is the Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour speaking Monday.
*  It was a historic moment then, and now that historic moment has been revived again.
*  And we sincerely hope, after 12 years since we changed our status to an observer state,
*  that the Security Council will elevate itself to implementing the global consensus on the
*  two-state solution by admitting the state of Palestine for full membership.
*  But the U.S., one of five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, is expected
*  to use its veto power.
*  U.S. representatives say Palestine needs to negotiate statehood with Israel before it's
*  granted statehood at the U.N.
*  Meanwhile, in The Hague, the International Court of Justice is holding its second day
*  of hearings into Nicaragua's case against Germany.
*  Germany's denied Nicaragua's charge that it violated the Genocide Convention by providing
*  military and financial aid to Israel.
*  Here in the U.S., Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she believes Israel's assault
*  on Gaza meets the legal definition of genocide.
*  Warren made the remark as she visited a mosque and was asked by constituents if she believed
*  Israel is committing genocide.
*  Warren said, quote, If you want to do it as an application of law, I believe that they'll
*  find that it is genocide and they have ample evidence to do so, she said.
*  Ireland's incoming Prime Minister Simon Harris has called for an immediate ceasefire,
*  saying in a speech Sunday the famine in Gaza is a, quote, specter no Irish person can bear,
*  referencing Ireland's historical famines, including the Great Famine of the mid-19th
*  century.
*  Harris, who is being sworn in by Ireland's parliament today, had a message for Israeli
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu, let me say this to you this evening.
*  The Irish people could not be clearer.
*  We are repulsed by your actions.
*  Ceasefire now and let the aid flow safely.
*  Iran's foreign minister opened a new diplomatic site in the Syrian capital Damascus Monday
*  one week after Israel bombed the Iranian consulate, killing at least seven Iranian officers.
*  Hossein Amirabdollahian renewed Iran's vow to retaliate and accused the U.S. of giving
*  Israel the green light for the attack.
*  HOSSEIN AMIRABDOLLAHIAN, Iranian Foreign Minister
*  I want to say from here in Damascus with a loud voice, America is responsible for this
*  terrorist attack and it must take responsibility.
*  Meanwhile, Iranian press is reporting Tehran told the Biden administration it will refrain
*  from attacking Israel if the U.S. can secure a ceasefire in Gaza.
*  The report has not been confirmed that Tehran and Biden administration has denied it.
*  The University of Michigan has come under fire over its proposed disruptive activity
*  policy, which was issued by the university president, Santa Ono, after Palestinian rights
*  activists interrupted a speech he was giving.
*  The ACLU of Michigan warns the policy will have a chilling effect and likely lead to
*  violations of the First Amendment.
*  Elsewhere, Vanderbilt University in Tennessee has expelled, suspended and issued disciplinary
*  probations to a group of students who engaged in a sit-in protest demanding Vanderbilt divest
*  from companies complicit in Israel's occupation and killing of Palestinians.
*  Special counsel Jack Smith is urging the Supreme Court to dismiss Donald Trump's bid for
*  immunity in his federal election interference case, arguing presidents are subject to criminal
*  law.
*  Supreme Court justices are scheduled to hear arguments in the case April 25th.
*  In other Trump news, the GOP frontrunner said Monday abortion rights should be decided by
*  states.
*  Trump has refrained from endorsing a national abortion ban, but has taken credit for the
*  Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade, which has led to a cascade of abortion bans
*  in Republican-run states, including Florida, where a six-week ban is set to go into effect
*  May 1st.
*  The trial for 27 people charged in connection with the Panama Papers scandal began Monday
*  in Panama City, eight years after the massive data leak.
*  In 2016, an international team of journalists published millions of documents exposing how
*  the Panama-based Mo'zak Fonseca law firm set up a global network of shell companies
*  for some of the wealthiest people in the world, heads of state and other elites, to hide money
*  offshore, avoiding taxes and oversight.
*  The leak prompted the resignation of Iceland's prime minister and implicated other world
*  leaders, including former British Prime Minister David Cameron and Russian President Vladimir
*  Putin.
*  Those currently on trial include the founders of the now-defunct Mo'zak Fonseca law firm.
*  The Panama Papers represent just a fraction of the trillions of dollars hidden away, often
*  illegally, in offshore tax havens.
*  About 100 people were killed, including children, after an overcrowded makeshift ferry sank
*  off the northern coast of Mozambique.
*  Some 20 others are missing.
*  The group of 130 people had fled from Nampula on mainland Mozambique, reportedly after hearing
*  news of a cholera outbreak.
*  Mozambican authorities blamed their deaths on the spread of misinformation about the
*  spread of the disease.
*  President Biden announced new plans to cancel student debt for about 23 million people.
*  Some of those to benefit include borrowers who now owe more than their original loan
*  amount due to out-of-control interests, those who have had debts for over 20 years, borrowers
*  who were enrolled in so-called low-value school programs and those facing economic hardship.
*  The new plan would completely erase student debt for around 4 million borrowers.
*  Biden announced the debt relief in a speech in Madison, Wisconsin, Monday, as he made
*  another pitch for re-election in the key swing state.
*  I also want to make—and I've been pushing this, and if I'm re-elected, I'm going
*  to push it hard, and we're going to get it done next time—is I want to make community
*  college tuition free.
*  So you won't need loans at all.
*  We're cutting half the cost of going to college.
*  In Strasbourg, France, the European Court of Human Rights handed out one victory and
*  two defeats for the climate justice movement today, as it ruled on three historic climate
*  cases.
*  The court ruled in favor of over 2,000 senior women from Switzerland who argued their rights
*  were violated by governmental inaction on the climate crisis.
*  The court finds that there were some critical lacunae in the Swiss authorities' process
*  of putting in place the relevant domestic regulatory framework.
*  This included a failure to quantify, through a carbon budget or otherwise, national greenhouse
*  gas emissions limitations.
*  Furthermore, as recognized by the relevant authorities, the respondent state had previously
*  failed to meet its past greenhouse gas emission reduction targets by failing to act in good
*  time and in an appropriate and consistent manner.
*  The Swiss women hailed their historic victory, but the celebration was tempered by the court's
*  dismissal of similar cases by six youth activists in Portugal and a former French mayor.
*  Activist Greta Thumbiri, who was at the courthouse for the verdicts, weighed in on those verdicts.
*  And the Brazilian state issued a historic apology for the atrocities committed against
*  indigenous peoples during its military dictatorship.
*  The unprecedented move came as Brazil marked last week the 60th anniversary of the 1964
*  U.S. Baku that ushered in the military dictatorship, which ruled for the next two decades.
*  Brazil's National Truth Commission found 8,300 indigenous people were killed during
*  the dictatorship.
*  Others were thrown off their land, imprisoned in internment camps and tortured.
*  The apology came after the Guarani, Kiowa and the Crenac indigenous groups requested
*  a collective apology from the Brazilian government's Amnesty Commission.
*  During a ceremony last Tuesday, the commission's chairwoman, Inaya Destutz, kneeled in front
*  of indigenous leaders to ask for their forgiveness.
*  Here she addresses Janira Crenac.
*  I'm asking for forgiveness for the persecution that in the last 524 years your people, as
*  well as all the other original peoples, suffered due to the invasion that the non-indigenous
*  people on this land that belongs to you.
*  So you as leader, as the matriarch of the Crenac people, please bear our respect, our
*  tributes and our sincere apologies so that this never happens again.
*  Also last week on Friday, prominent journalist, author and environmentalist Alton Crenac became
*  the first indigenous member of the prestigious Brazilian Academy of Letters.
*  Crenac vowed to use a seat to open the elite academy to the more than 200 indigenous languages
*  in Brazil.
*  He also reflected on the government's apology issued days earlier, saying, quote, saying
*  Sorry afterwards means very little in terms of reparation.
*  What we need is real reparations for native peoples, he said.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
