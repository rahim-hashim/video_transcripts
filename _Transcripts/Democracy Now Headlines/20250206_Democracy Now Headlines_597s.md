World leaders are rebuking Donald Trump's proposal for the United States to take over the Gaza Strip, ethnically cleansing the region of Palestinians. "There's no question that even though the entire region would reject it â€¦ the fundamental reality is that we are heading to the complete destruction of Palestinian society in Gaza as a matter of status quo," says our guest Omar Baddar. Baddar, a Palestinian American political analyst and member of the National Policy Council of the Arab American Institute, also discusses Trump's recent statements signaling a potential breakdown of the official ceasefire in Gaza.

# "Trump Does Not See Palestinians as Human Beings": Plan for U.S. to "Take Over" Gaza Faces Outcry
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds)
*  Fallout continues to grow over President Trump's proposal for the United States to take over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=0.0s)]
*  Gaza and displace the entire Palestinian population in order to turn Gaza into what he called, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=4.42s)]
*  quote, the Riviera of the Middle East. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=9.96s)]
*  Trump made the shocking announcement at the White House Tuesday while meeting with Israeli [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=12.6s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=15.96s)]
*  The Trump administration has since tried to walk back some of the president's comments. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=18.36s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Palestinians would only be temporarily removed from Gaza. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=22.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, has ordered the Israeli army to create [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=28.2s)]
*  a plan for what he calls the, quote, voluntary departure of Palestinians from Gaza. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=32.6s)]
*  On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned against any call for the ethnic [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  cleansing of the territory. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=42.68s)]
*  Palestinians have widely condemned Trump's proposal. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  This is Qasem Abu Hassan, a displaced Palestinian living in Ra'afah. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=48.0s)]
*  No matter what the Israeli defense minister says about the displacement of the people [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=54.48s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip, this is not possible. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  This is our country, our land. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  We will hang on to it until the last moment. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=63.28s)]
*  We've been waiting for a year and a half, just like the baby waits for food and water. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=65.92s)]
*  We have waited for the ceasefire to start to come back to our homes, despite that we [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=70.22s)]
*  don't have houses or homes anymore. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=73.96s)]
*  So we got displaced to the rubble, and we built tents and stayed. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=75.84s)]
*  We're joined now by Palestinian-American political analyst Omar Bada'r. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=80.84s)]
*  He's a member of the National Policy Council of the Arab American Institute. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=85.72s)]
*  Omar, thanks so much for being with us. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=89.56s)]
*  Respond to what President Trump laid out and Netanyahu underscored as they stood at a joint [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=92.12s)]
*  news conference in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=99.88s)]
*  He talked about Gaza being rebuilt by the United States as a Riviera on the Mediterranean [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=104.36s)]
*  and again is pushing Arab countries to accept the Palestinian population. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=112.24s)]
*  He said America would own Gaza. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=118.12s)]
*  You know, Amy, everything Trump says and does is a little bit extreme, but the lunacy of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=121.08s)]
*  this particular proposal is really in a class of its own. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=127.48s)]
*  Now, we've heard a lot of comments from Washington of politicians who glibly say racist things [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=130.44s)]
*  like flatten Gaza and turn it into a parking lot or whatever else. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=135.32s)]
*  But what Trump has done different is that he's put this forward as a serious proposal, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=139.88s)]
*  essentially making it official U.S. policy, the destruction of Palestinian society, the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=144.08s)]
*  scattering of Palestinian neighboring countries. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=148.32s)]
*  And on top of that, for the U.S. to just come and take Palestinian territory over and make [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=150.32s)]
*  it part of the United States, I mean, this is just, it's difficult to find the words [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=155.16s)]
*  to really describe how absurd that is. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=158.6s)]
*  But the most despicable part of it is that it was framed as concern for Palestinians. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=160.8s)]
*  That's why we're doing this at a time when he's standing directly across the podium from [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=165.6s)]
*  another man who's smirking, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court because [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=170.2s)]
*  he is responsible for the destruction of Gaza and the devastation of a civilian population, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=175.0s)]
*  the slaughtering of tens of thousands of children and making it unlivable. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=179.8s)]
*  All you would need in this case is for the U.S. to tell Netanyahu to stop destroying [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  Gaza and allow it to be rebuilt so that Palestinians can live there as a free people in their [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=188.12s)]
*  own country. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=193.68s)]
*  And yet that seems to be not on the table because Trump does not see Palestinians as [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=195.6s)]
*  human beings. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=200.64s)]
*  He thinks they can be moved around like cattle. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=201.64s)]
*  And that's where this insane pronouncement actually comes from. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  And the fact that Netanyahu sitting there with glee in his face, you could see it, the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=206.6s)]
*  dream of the right wing in Israel for a very long time has been to drive Palestinians completely [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=211.32s)]
*  out of the area so that Israel can just expand and take over all over that territory. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=216.04s)]
*  It's difficult to imagine that we'd be living in a moment in which the president of the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  United States is openly advocating that position and facilitating one of the worst crimes that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=225.2s)]
*  we would have ever seen in history if Israel is allowed to complete it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=230.04s)]
*  So Omar, what do you think the impact of these statements will be? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=233.68s)]
*  One of the other things that Trump said is that he's discussed this plan with leaders [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=237.76s)]
*  in the region and they all, quote, love it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=241.76s)]
*  So if you could say what do you think the impact will be and how have leaders in the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=244.2s)]
*  region actually responded? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Trump is basically lying. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  I mean, there's nobody who lies more than he breathes, probably, than Trump does. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=252.64s)]
*  And everybody in the region actually wants an end to this absolute horror show that has [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=257.48s)]
*  been put on for the past 15 months of Israel's genocide in Gaza. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  They want a way to defuse the situation. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  And instead, Trump is proposing to exacerbate it, make it worse, and to also impose a refugee [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  crisis on neighboring countries. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  All of it, nobody wants this, with the exception of Israel and some of Trump's high-dollar [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=276.68s)]
*  donors who are pushing for this idea that Israel should control the land from the river [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  to the sea. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=286.18s)]
*  That's who wants this plan. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  And there's no question that even though the entire region would absolutely reject it, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=289.36s)]
*  I'm worried about because there's been a lot of commentary of, of course, he's just bluffing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=294.0s)]
*  He would never send the US military to try to do that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  I think all of that is true. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=300.56s)]
*  But if all Trump does is simply allow Netanyahu to continue what he's been doing for the past [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  15 months indefinitely, Gaza is already unlivable. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=306.84s)]
*  There is no infrastructure. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  There is no clean water. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=311.76s)]
*  And if you prevent it from being rebuilt and allow Netanyahu to just continue treating [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  it as a killing field, just this concentration camp with millions of people in it being devastated [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  over and over again, the fundamental reality is that we are heading to the complete destruction [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=321.96s)]
*  of Palestinian society in Gaza as a matter of status quo. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=326.23999999999995s)]
*  And the world really has a choice to make right now of whether we have to stand up collectively [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  and say that never again meant something. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=334.68s)]
*  And this is absolutely the time to stand up and say this has to come to an end or whether [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  we're just going to sit there and watch as Netanyahu continues decimating that concentration camp [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=341.14s)]
*  endlessly in the hopes that we can eventually get Palestinians either to die or to leave. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=346.56s)]
*  Omar Bader, it's clear the U.S. is pushing very hard, especially Jordan and Egypt. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=352.16s)]
*  I mean, you haveâ€”the president has just invited the king of Jordan to the White House [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=357.44s)]
*  within the next few weeks, and the State Department announcing it's approved a potential foreign [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=364.08s)]
*  military sale to Egypt for the acquisition of what's called ANTPS-78 long-range radar [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  systems. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=375.48s)]
*  It's more than $300 million worth of weapons in that system alone. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=376.48s)]
*  Yeah, there isâ€”Trump continues to be under the impression that you can buy people. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=382.48s)]
*  And there are some things in which you can't just buy people. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=389.72s)]
*  You can bribe your way however you want. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=392.8s)]
*  But the question of Palestine is oneâ€”it's the lens through which the entire Arab world [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=395.44s)]
*  views international relations. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=401.08000000000004s)]
*  The entire region understands that there is a very, very deep grievance in the fact that [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=403.28s)]
*  Palestinians have not been allowed to be a free people in their own country, and the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=407.28s)]
*  fact that Israel's atrocities and occupation and apartheid and just the endless list of [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=411.2s)]
*  crimes that has been imposed on them that is live-streamed on people's phones and computers [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=416.91999999999996s)]
*  throughout the entire region is a source of deep resentment. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=422.23999999999995s)]
*  People are furious watching all of this. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=426.35999999999996s)]
*  And I don't think that any amount of money is going to convince these governments to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=428.35999999999996s)]
*  say, risk being in complete disalignment with your people. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=432.08s)]
*  I mean, let's be serious. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=435.6s)]
*  Those are not particularly democratic regimes, but they understand that they can't go so [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=437.76s)]
*  far out of step with where their people are because that makes those regimes on shaky [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=441.16s)]
*  ground as well. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=445.88s)]
*  And I think that Trump is going to discover that no amount of money in the world is going [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=447.48s)]
*  to convince these governments to essentially risk committing suicide. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=450.52s)]
*  And whether he might be able to convince them to take on a small symbolic number, a few [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=455.4s)]
*  thousand here and there just so Trump can brag and pretend that his plan worked in some [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  way, I don't know about that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=464.8s)]
*  But certainly the plot of complete and total displacement of Palestinians from Gaza is [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=466.28000000000003s)]
*  not going to be something that anybody in the region is going to agree to. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=470.84000000000003s)]
*  We understand what this is. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=474.0s)]
*  We know it's an attempt at destroying Palestine and Palestinian society. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=475.7s)]
*  Everybody in the region understands that. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=479.6s)]
*  And it's not going to be something that anybody is going to accept or stand by and watch happen. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=481.04s)]
*  So Omar, could you say finally, what do you think the impact of this is going to be on [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=485.08s)]
*  the ceasefire, which so far is holding? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=488.32s)]
*  Yeah, I worry deeply about that ceasefire because Trump's tone has changed significantly [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=492.0s)]
*  on it. He came in talking about the importance of the ceasefire, threatening to unleash hell [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=497.55999999999995s)]
*  if it were not to come about. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  And now he's saying he has no confidence that the ceasefire is going to hold. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=503.55999999999995s)]
*  And judging by the glee on Netanyahu's face, it seems clear that Netanyahu is about to [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=506.84s)]
*  be given a free hand to continue the slaughter in Gaza in order to, quote unquote, complete [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=511.52s)]
*  and achieve the aims of the war. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=516.0s)]
*  And by the way, the aims of the war are not achievable. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=517.68s)]
*  The forcible retrieval of hostages through violence has actually killed infinitely more [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=520.0799999999999s)]
*  hostages than it has rescued. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=524.4s)]
*  And the alternative of also defeating Hamas is also a nonstarter. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=525.96s)]
*  The real aim of that war is something that Netanyahu said early on in a private conversation [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=529.56s)]
*  that was reported in Israeli press, which is to thin the population in Gaza down to [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=533.84s)]
*  a minimum. That is the real aim. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=538.96s)]
*  And that is precisely what Netanyahu hopes to continue doing in order to get rid of what [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=540.88s)]
*  Israel views racially as a demographic problem. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=546.4399999999999s)]
*  The fact that there are too many Palestinians who exist on the land that Israel wants, that's [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=549.56s)]
*  always been the problem because it gets in the way of establishing this Jewish supremacist [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=553.6s)]
*  state. It makes it a permanent apartheid state to have a Palestinian majority. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=557.84s)]
*  And that is precisely what Israel is fighting tooth and nail to undo. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=561.6s)]
*  And no matter what the cost is to the lives of literally tens of thousands of children [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=565.72s)]
*  killed so far and possibly millions impacted if this project continues. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhJzpag-ds&t=571.24s)]
