*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Al Jazeera is reporting Israel has killed more than 100 people in Lebanon so far today
*  in a wave of extensive airstrikes, hitting more than 300 targets.
*  Lebanon's Health Ministry reports the dead include children, women and paramedics.
*  More than 400 people have been wounded.
*  Earlier today, Israel instructed residents of southern Lebanon to leave their homes if
*  they live near any site used by Hezbollah.
*  Israel sent text messages, made phone calls to tens of thousands of people in what Lebanese
*  officials decried as a form of psychological warfare.
*  Israel's also hacked into Lebanese radio stations.
*  On Friday, Israel killed at least 45 people in a massive airstrike on a densely populated
*  residential neighborhood of Beirut.
*  The dead include 16 members of Hezbollah, including two senior commanders, Ibrahim Akil
*  and Ahmed Wahbi.
*  Lebanon's transportation minister, Ali Hamiya, condemned the Israeli attacks.
*  The Israeli enemy, with all its continued crimes, with the excuse of pursuing Hezbollah,
*  has targeted a residential compound.
*  It has committed a massacre to a residential building against unarmed children, women at
*  their homes.
*  The Israeli enemy is taking the region to war.
*  Hezbollah responded to Friday's attack by firing a barrage of rockets into Israel targeting
*  an air base and weapons factories.
*  Meanwhile, former CIA Director and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has accused Israel
*  of committing an act of terrorism by rigging thousands of walkie-talkies and pagers that
*  exploded in a coordinated attack last week that killed at least 37 people, injuring thousands
*  in Lebanon.
*  Panetta spoke to CBS News.
*  I don't think there's any question that it's a form of terrorism.
*  This has gone right into the supply chain.
*  Yeah.
*  It's gone right into the supply chain.
*  And when you have terror going into the supply chain, it makes people ask the question, what
*  the hell is next?
*  In Gaza, Israel is continuing to target schools and shelters housing displaced Palestinians.
*  On Saturday, an Israeli attack on a school in Gaza City killed 22 people, including 13
*  children and six women.
*  One of the victims was a three-month-old baby.
*  Survivors said there are no safe places to go in Gaza.
*  We got displaced and came to this school.
*  I left from my house after it was targeted and my husband and my two children were martyred.
*  And we came to this school and thought it was safe.
*  We thought this was a safe place.
*  Then they target us.
*  Where are we supposed to go if at a school we're not safe?
*  We got displaced seven or eight times, and I'm all alone with my two remaining children.
*  An Israeli airstrike earlier today in Dar al-Bala killed a mother and four of her children.
*  Meanwhile, heavy rain has flooded makeshift camps in Al Mawasi and other areas of Gaza.
*  Press freedom groups have condemned the Israeli military for raiding and shutting down Al
*  Jazeera's Ramallah office in the occupied West Bank.
*  Heavily armed Israeli troops were seen on live TV entering the office, confiscating
*  equipment while ordering the office closed for 45 days.
*  Israeli troops also tore down a poster of Shereen Abu Akhla, the Al Jazeera journalist,
*  Palestinian-American, who was fatally shot by Israeli forces while covering a raid on
*  Jenin two years ago.
*  This is Al Jazeera's West Bank bureau chief, Waleed Al Omari.
*  This is a blatant attack on the Al Jazeera channel and Al Jazeera network and those who
*  are working with them, as well as on the freedom of speech and the task of delivering the truth.
*  This is an attack that aims to obscure the truth.
*  The raid and closure comes months after Israel banned Al Jazeera from broadcasting inside
*  Israel.
*  In Sri Lanka, Anura Kamara Desanayake was sworn in as president today, becoming the
*  country's first leftist leader.
*  He won Saturday's election after campaigning to renegotiate a deeply unpopular IMF bailout
*  signed during Sri Lanka's worst economic crisis.
*  He's a Marxist and former student leader who's vowed to fight corruption and anti-austerity
*  measures.
*  We have a deep understanding that we have got a challenging country.
*  Our politics must be cleaner than this.
*  There is a need for a political culture that people expect.
*  We will commit ourselves to that.
*  The public have a very negative view of politicians and politics.
*  In the United States, voting for the presidential election began Friday in Virginia, South Dakota
*  and Minnesota.
*  Voting rights advocates are expressing alarm after the Georgia State Election Board, which
*  is controlled by Trump supporters, approved a new rule to require election workers hand
*  count the number of ballots cast on election night in a move that could significantly delay
*  the reporting of results.
*  Critics include many top Republican officials in Georgia.
*  Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris has agreed to take part in a CNN presidential
*  debate on October 23rd, but Donald Trump has not agreed to debate again.
*  Over the weekend, Donald Trump campaigned in North Carolina, but he made no mention
*  of the scandal involving his hand-picked candidate for North Carolina governor, the
*  state's lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson.
*  Last week, CNN revealed Robinson had described himself as a black Nazi on a pornographic
*  website a decade ago.
*  He'd also expressed support for reinstating slavery.
*  Much of Robinson's senior campaign staff has resigned after he refused to drop out
*  of the race.
*  In other election news, the U.S. Supreme Court's declined a request to put Green Party presidential
*  candidate Jill Stein on the presidential ballot in Nevada.
*  The Democratic Party had sued to keep Stein off the ballot for failing to submit the proper
*  forms.
*  In Sudan, the U.N. is calling for an immediate halt to intensified fighting in the western
*  Darfur city of Al-Fasher, which has been under siege by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces
*  for five months.
*  Activists have targeted black Sudanese communities in Al-Fasher as fears mount of more widespread
*  ethnically motivated attacks.
*  Famines have been declared in a refugee camp near Al-Fasher amidst a spiraling humanitarian
*  catastrophe.
*  This is Martha Pobi, assistant secretary general for Africa, speaking at the U.N. last week.
*  Even while millions of lives are at risk across Sudan, hundreds of thousands of civilians
*  trapped in Al-Fasher are now at risk of the consequences of mass violence as fighting
*  engulfs the city.
*  The stakes could not be higher.
*  The risk of the escalation of fighting, fueling a dangerous ethnic dimension of this conflict,
*  is well known.
*  So are the destabilizing effects for the entire region.
*  On Friday, a group of Democratic lawmakers sent President Biden a letter voicing concerns
*  over the UAE's support of the RSF ahead of Biden's meeting today with the Emirati
*  President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed at the White House.
*  World leaders are gathering in New York for the United Nations General Assembly and the
*  U.N. Summit of the Future.
*  U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres spoke on Sunday.
*  Conflicts are raging and multiplying from the Middle East to Ukraine and Sudan with
*  no end in sight.
*  Our collective security system is threatened by geopolitical divides, nuclear posturing
*  and the development of new weapons and theaters of war.
*  Resources that could bring opportunities and hope are invested in death and destruction.
*  At the end of the U.N. meetings, President Biden hosted the leaders of Australia, India
*  and Japan at his Delaware home for the final Quad Summit of Biden's presidency.
*  The meeting came just days after Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell testified that China
*  has become, quote, the most significant challenge, unquote, the U.S. has ever faced.
*  Climate weeks kicked off here in New York, coinciding with the start of the U.N. General
*  Assembly.
*  On Friday, protesters took to the streets around the world to launch the global climate
*  strike ahead of the U.N. meetings.
*  This is 16-year-old Lena Goings, an organizer with Fridays for Future in New York.
*  Since climate week is coming up, we really want to keep our message on top of mind for
*  everyone who's attending.
*  We want to make sure that people are remembering justice, equity and ending the era of fossil
*  fuels.
*  We have to beat around the bush with this.
*  We have to make sure that we are prioritizing real solutions, prioritizing communities.
*  The state of South Carolina executed Freddie Eugene Owens by lethal injection Friday.
*  He'd been convicted of killing a convenience store clerk in 1997.
*  Hours before the execution, Owens' co-defendant signed a statement saying Owens, who is black,
*  was not at the store at the time of the shooting.
*  In a statement, Owens' mother said, quote,
*  The legal errors, hidden deals and false evidence that made tonight possible should shame us
*  all, unquote.
*  It was the first execution in South Carolina in 13 years.
*  And the site of the worst nuclear disaster in U.S. history, the Three Mile Island Nuclear
*  Power Plant in Pennsylvania, may reopen to help Microsoft fuel its artificial intelligence
*  ambitions.
*  The nuclear plant has been closed since 2019.
*  The plant's owner, Constellation Energy, is seeking to reopen it by 2028, after Microsoft
*  agreed to buy energy needed for its growing fleet of data centers powering its artificial
*  intelligence operations.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
