In his first live broadcast interview since being released from ICE detention, Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil tells Democracy Now! about his experience behind bars, the ongoing threat of deportation that hangs over him and why he continues to speak out against the U.S.-backed Israeli war on Gaza. The Columbia University graduate was the first pro-Palestinian campus protester to be jailed by the Trump administration. Khalil is now reunited with his wife Noor and newborn son Deen, after he was released on bail last month by a federal judge. Khalil says the Trump administration's attempts to silence him are "a distraction from the genocide in Palestine."

# EXCLUSIVE: Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian Activist Jailed by ICE for 104 Days, in First Live Interview
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=6.24s)]
*  Officials in Gaza say Israeli attacks have killed over 300 Palestinians over the past [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=8.72s)]
*  48 hours. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=14.88s)]
*  One strike on the home of the renowned cardiologist Marwan al-Sultan at Indonesian Hospital killed [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=16.56s)]
*  the doctor, along with his mother, sister and aunt. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=23.36s)]
*  He's at least the 70th healthcare worker killed by Israel in the past 50 days. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=25.56s)]
*  This comes as Palestinians say at least 33 people were slaughtered today as they lined [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=30.68s)]
*  up for aid at militarized aid distribution sites run by the U.S. and Israeli-backed so-called [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=35.6s)]
*  Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=42.08s)]
*  The reportedly unprovoked killings came as the Associated Press published recent videos [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  contractors at GHF sites firing live ammunition and stun grenades at starving Palestinians [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=50.48s)]
*  as they scrambled for food. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=58.72s)]
*  The AP says it received the footage from two U.S. contractors who wished to remain anonymous [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  in order to blow the whistle on abuses. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  The contractors report security staffers were often unqualified, unvetted, heavily armed [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=69.96s)]
*  and seemed to have an open license to do whatever they wished. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=76.19999999999999s)]
*  In this clip, published by the AP, contractors erupt in cheers as shots ring out. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=80.19999999999999s)]
*  At that moment, bursts of gunfire erupt close by, at least 15 shots. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  This comes as the Trump administration continues its crackdown on pro-Palestinian demonstrators, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=93.4s)]
*  especially universities across the United States. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=106.84s)]
*  In a moment, we'll be joined by the first pro-Palestinian campus protester to be jailed [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=111.2s)]
*  by the Trump administration, Columbia University graduate and Palestinian student protest leader [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=116.4s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  Video shows his arrest on March 8th when he was detained by plainclothes officers who [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  did not identify themselves. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=131.12s)]
*  The video was filmed by his eight-month pregnant wife, Noor Abdullah, whose voice you're [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=133.52s)]
*  hearing in this clip. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  Can you please specify what agency is taking him, please? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=141.12s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=146.12s)]
*  They're not talking to me. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=147.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=148.12s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=149.12s)]
*  The lawyer would like to speak to somebody. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=150.84s)]
*  Oh my God, they're literally running away from me. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=153.84s)]
*  That was March. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=157.88s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil has now reunited with his wife and newborn son after he was released on bail [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=158.88s)]
*  less than two weeks ago by a federal judge following over 100 days in the Louisiana [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=167.28s)]
*  ICE jail. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  Khalil spoke outside the jail in Gina, Louisiana, when he was freed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  No one is illegal. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  No human is illegal. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=183.23999999999998s)]
*  That's the message. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  The message is justice will prevail no matter what this administration may try to portray. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=187.23999999999998s)]
*  Two weeks ago on Saturday, Democracy Now! was at Newark Airport when Mahmoud Khalil [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  was reunited with his wife and his son. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=203.68s)]
*  I just want to go back and just continue the work that I was already doing, advocating [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=210.68s)]
*  for Palestinian rights, a speech that should actually be celebrated rather than punished, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=219.4s)]
*  as this administration wants to do. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil was standing next to the New York Congressmember, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  On Sunday, the following day, the Palestinian student leader, now graduate of Columbia University, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=237.4s)]
*  stood next to his wife, Noor Abdullah, and addressed over a thousand supporters, as well [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=246.0s)]
*  as the press, on the Upper West Side outside the Cathedral of St. John the Divine here [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=252.5s)]
*  in Manhattan, blocks from his campus of Columbia University. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=259.0s)]
*  I would like to salute the courage of all the students at Columbia and across the nation. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=266.0s)]
*  These students who continue to protest, I want to honor especially my friends at Columbia [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=278.96s)]
*  University, especially those who are currently battling expulsion and suspension for their [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=286.32s)]
*  consciousness stand. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=298.68s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil is a lawful permanent resident, green card holder, who has not been charged [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=301.76s)]
*  with any crimes, yet he was held in a Gina, Louisiana, ICE jail for 104 days. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=309.12s)]
*  This all comes amidst growing calls for Israel to be held accountable for alleged war crimes [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=318.58s)]
*  in Gaza, including attacks on hospitals. Mahmoud Khalil joins us now for his first live global [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=324.78s)]
*  broadcast since his release. Mahmoud, welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=332.78s)]
*  Thanks, Amy. Thanks for having me. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=339.78s)]
*  So, I want to start with the same question I asked you at the airport. How does it feel [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=344.78s)]
*  to be free? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=351.78s)]
*  I mean, absolutely it goes without saying. It feels good just to be reunited with the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=355.78s)]
*  family and with my baby son. But at the same time, it feels difficult watching the Palestinian [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=365.53999999999996s)]
*  people, like, being massacred right now in Gaza. And this really adds more to the feeling [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=375.94s)]
*  of responsibility on me to continue advocating for the rights of the Palestinians. And this [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=384.94s)]
*  is what we should focus on right now, because my freedom is nothing compared to the suffering [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=391.78s)]
*  that the Palestinian people are going through right now in Palestine. And this is what the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=405.73999999999995s)]
*  message should be, that whether it's my arrest, whether the focus right now on immigration [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=413.74s)]
*  is just like a distraction of what's really happening in Palestine, that this administration [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=422.74s)]
*  is investing and funding war crimes in Gaza, that this administration is unconditionally [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=427.74s)]
*  supporting Israel, whether politically or militarily. This is what we should focus on, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=435.74s)]
*  rather than individual cases, I believe. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=443.74s)]
*  Mahmoud, I'm wondering if you can take us back to March 8th. That day, when you were [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=448.74s)]
*  taken by Homeland Security or federal agents, I don't even know, at this point, do you [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=456.74s)]
*  know who it is that you were taken by and what happened on that day, where you were? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=463.74s)]
*  Yeah. So the Trump administration basically illegally ripped me away from my family, because [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=472.74s)]
*  they are simply trying to silence anyone speaking out against Israel, atrocities against the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=480.74s)]
*  Palestinians. The officers or the agents who kidnapped me did not introduce themselves. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=488.62s)]
*  They said at first it's police, then DHS, without giving any details, without even presenting [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=497.7s)]
*  an arrest warrant, which is the most basic thing that any law enforcement, any law enforcement [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=505.5s)]
*  should do in a country that proclaims justice and due process, which unfortunately did not [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=514.46s)]
*  happen. So they basically kidnapped me and for more than 30 hours kept moving me from [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=522.14s)]
*  one place to another, literally moving me more than 1,400 miles across the country. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=530.14s)]
*  Can I ask you something? One of the men who abducted you in your Columbia University housing, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=538.14s)]
*  is it true that he was the Homeland Security agent who was honored by President Trump in [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=545.14s)]
*  his first term in office, Elvin Hernandez? To be honest, I don't have concrete information [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=553.14s)]
*  about that. It has been only two weeks since my release. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=565.78s)]
*  And you didn't know at the time who these men were? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=568.66s)]
*  I didn't. No, no, I didn't. To be honest, the story [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=575.66s)]
*  that the government presented was once over, one time over another, changed to sort of [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=581.66s)]
*  serve their part of the story. At the beginning they said, well, we had an arrest warrant [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=592.86s)]
*  and we arrested Mahmoud outside of Columbia, of his Columbia residence. But then when we [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=598.26s)]
*  presented the video evidence, they said, oh, he tried to flee. So these agents are trained [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=604.92s)]
*  to lie, are trained to just instigate violence with those who they are seeking to detain. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=615.68s)]
*  So we have played over and over the video of your wife, Dr. Noor Abdullah, on the phone [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=625.96s)]
*  with the lawyer, desperately trying to figure out what was happening and where you were [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=632.24s)]
*  being taken. In fact, can you talk about when you had emailed the president of Columbia [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=637.64s)]
*  University, Dr. Armstrong at the time, because you were so concerned about what was happening [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=645.04s)]
*  to you, you wanted some kind of protection? Yeah. I mean ICE acts as a protection system [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=652.76s)]
*  against Trump's militia arm. That's the way that now they are functioning, and we [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=662.44s)]
*  can see this evident, not only in my case, and just like cases across the country. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=670.36s)]
*  And the weeks leading up to my arrest, I noticed a more vicious, coordinated smear campaign [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=678.96s)]
*  against me online, the same accounts mentioning Rubio, the White House, mentioning also like [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=686.48s)]
*  just baseless claims about Mahmoud Kharil, who he is, like an international student, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=698.2s)]
*  a Hamas agent, and all these labels. So I felt that since I didn't have the opportunity [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  to speak to him, I didn't have any legal at that point representation. I wanted Columbia [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=716.2800000000001s)]
*  to first to protect me, because these actors are Columbia students and faculty, the ones [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=723.2800000000001s)]
*  who were waging this smear campaign against me online and calling for the administration [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=730.2800000000001s)]
*  to deport me. So this is the minimum that Columbia should have done, is to protect the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=737.76s)]
*  hostile actors. So, and that was not, I mean, I sent the email the morning of my arrest, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=743.08s)]
*  I believe, and this was not the first email that we sent to Columbia and don't answer. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=750.08s)]
*  Unfortunately Columbia did not and does not until now treat all students as equal. What [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=756.08s)]
*  they care about is basically money and protecting their brand rather than going and listening [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=763.72s)]
*  to their students, protecting their students with their legitimate concerns, not to have [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=771.36s)]
*  any special treatment for the Palestinian or the students supporting Palestine on campus. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=782.0s)]
*  But Columbia failed to do that. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=787.24s)]
*  I'm wondering if Columbia, did Columbia University support you in any way? I remember [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=788.88s)]
*  in the case of Rameza Alsturk, who is a Tufts Fulbright Scholar and graduate student, also [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=792.76s)]
*  abducted by federal agents, Tufts wrote a statement of support. And then Sudeikhan, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=798.56s)]
*  the Dr. Sudeikhan at Georgetown, Georgetown also spoke out. What about Columbia University [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=806.8399999999999s)]
*  on your behalf? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=813.88s)]
*  Columbia did not offer any sort of support when it comes to the legal case. I think that [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=819.16s)]
*  and this is shameful on a university that claims to support international students and [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=829.2399999999999s)]
*  to support the right of freedom of speech. But this was not surprising. Columbia has [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=837.8399999999999s)]
*  capitulated to the Trump administration, but before then they capitulated to the Zionist [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=845.5999999999999s)]
*  donors and politicians in this country. So to see them not offer this kind of support [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=853.52s)]
*  absolutely was not surprising, unfortunately. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=862.96s)]
*  Can you talk about your time in the Jena ICE jail? You were held for over a hundred days [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=867.64s)]
*  there. Can you talk about the other prisoners, the conditions under which you were held? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=875.6s)]
*  Then I want to get to the day your baby, your baby Dean, was born without you there. But [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=881.12s)]
*  talk about the jail until that point. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=886.92s)]
*  In jail you spend 24-7 with the same people. So one of the things that we do is to just [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=894.16s)]
*  share stories from people from around the world. And every day it's just a more hard [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=903.92s)]
*  breaking story than another with people being snatched off the streets or during their court [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=911.0799999999999s)]
*  hearings or ICE check-ins. These people were trying to fix their documentation. They committed [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=920.52s)]
*  no crimes whatsoever. So you have this shock with everyone who's coming in around why [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=930.04s)]
*  they are there. I shared the dorm with over 70 men. And the stories are really heartbreaking, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=937.04s)]
*  Amy, with people leaving their family outside without any kind of support, people who don't [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=947.76s)]
*  have their rights, don't know their rights, don't know their rights. And I think that [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  people don't know if they have any rights in fact. And with ICE, who basically don't [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=967.04s)]
*  tell anyone what their rights are and just deport people. I've seen people who unknowingly [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=976.56s)]
*  sign their deportation documents because ICE agents tricked them into doing so, which [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=986.48s)]
*  is a blatant violation of any rule of law or due process. And just like to say that [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=993.48s)]
*  the conditions inside were horrible. The food was horrible. The sleep quality equally bad. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1005.28s)]
*  And just the atmosphere where people were being snatched off the streets and being [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1015.16s)]
*  taken away. Where you are inside, you don't know what's happening and you're just [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1023.6s)]
*  expecting to follow orders and wait for an ICE officer to come and update you on your [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1027.3600000000001s)]
*  case. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1034.48s)]
*  Unfortunately, a lot of these detainees don't have legal representations. And I was very [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1035.08s)]
*  privileged to have an amazing legal team fighting on my behalf. And that took us three months [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1042.92s)]
*  for me to be released despite me being a legal resident in the United States. So imagine [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1049.92s)]
*  for a lot of these individuals who don't have this kind of representation and who have [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1057.3200000000002s)]
*  like more complications in their documentation. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1062.3200000000002s)]
*  Mahmoud, can you talk about the day of Dean's birth, your first born son? How did you learn [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1066.3200000000002s)]
*  that Noor had given birth? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1073.32s)]
*  That day was absolutely one of the most difficult days that I had to endure in my life. Being [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1081.4399999999998s)]
*  away from my wife and not having the opportunity to support her. And I was very fortunate to [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1093.04s)]
*  have Noor during this moment. And I was over the phone, so I would call every hour just [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1103.56s)]
*  to see if Noor is in labor or no. And the moment of the delivery, I spent like over [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1116.04s)]
*  three hours over the phone from 1, I think 1.30 in the morning until 4 or 4.30, just [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1123.04s)]
*  like trying to support Noor as much as I could because I did not want to miss that moment [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1138.3999999999999s)]
*  at all. And what made it very difficult is because like this could have been easily avoided [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1145.4s)]
*  where the Trump administration to follow the law or at least like to offer me for law, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1154.24s)]
*  like to go and be with my family for a few hours. But they refused that because they [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1162.24s)]
*  were not surprised. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1169.24s)]
*  And can you talk about the moment when you met Dean for the first time? I mean, as you [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1172.36s)]
*  describe it now, you really were with Noor then. Of course, you were separate, but you [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1180.28s)]
*  were there over the phone. You were there with Noor. You were there with Noor. You were [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1186.28s)]
*  there with Noor then. Of course, you were separate, but you were there over the phone. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1193.28s)]
*  You heard his first cries. But talk about holding him for the first time. I remember, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1199.28s)]
*  I mean, it was just weeks ago, why it was that your lawyers had to fight, a battery [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1206.08s)]
*  of lawyers for so many hours for Noor and Dean for you to be able to have a contact [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1211.68s)]
*  visit. I mean, you have not been charged with a crime, but in the jail, is that right where [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1219.68s)]
*  it was in Gina, Louisiana? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1225.68s)]
*  Yeah. As you said, I mean, it shouldn't take an army of lawyers to get a one-hour [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1230.68s)]
*  contact visit to let me hold my son. The first time I saw my son was, in fact, through a [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1240.8s)]
*  glass. So he was literally in front of me, but separated by glass. I couldn't hold [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1249.0s)]
*  him during the first time I saw him, which made me very, very angry about, like, a one [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1256.16s)]
*  centimeter or one inch of glass separating me from holding my son. And this is all by [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1266.8400000000001s)]
*  design, the cruelty of this administration, because their goal is to punish me as much [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1273.84s)]
*  as they could and in any way that they find, because what they want is they want to break [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1282.24s)]
*  me. They want to make an example out of me. And I think that's the only way to do that. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1293.56s)]
*  So the first time when we managed to get a court order, in fact, imagine getting a court [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1304.1599999999999s)]
*  order to force ICE to let me hold my son. And we had it for literally an hour, seven [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1309.52s)]
*  in the morning. So even when they agreed to do that, or not agreed, even when they were [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1320.32s)]
*  forced to allow me to hold my son, they chose to make an exception. So they made an exception. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1325.24s)]
*  Make it at seven in the morning in detention. So, I mean, the feeling, I don't think I [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1333.9199999999998s)]
*  can describe it. I was both very happy, but at the same time very angry and sad that it [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1341.9199999999998s)]
*  took us all this effort to have this one hour in detention. And basically I was really anxious. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1351.3999999999999s)]
*  And I was just looking at the clock when this hour would end. I just didn't want [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1358.4s)]
*  this hour to end. And the hour was the fastest hour in my life. Just like, you know, like [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1368.8000000000002s)]
*  it went like this. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1376.6000000000001s)]
*  And so you were released less than two weeks ago. And you were released in the first two [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1380.4s)]
*  years. And now you are living at home with your wife and your infant son. Do you feel [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1388.96s)]
*  safe? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1396.88s)]
*  I don't fully feel safe, to be honest, Amy. We all know the rhetoric that's currently [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1399.88s)]
*  going around in this country, the Islamophobia, the anti-Palestinian bigotry and racism, and [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1406.88s)]
*  this violence that was exported by Israel to this country, and being targeted by the [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1418.4s)]
*  people of Israel, the people of Israel, the people of Israel, the people of Israel, the [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1427.92s)]
*  Israeli government-affiliated groups here in the U.S. who are very dangerous, who would [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1437.8400000000001s)]
*  do anything to silence Palestinians, because for them, silencing is much more easier than [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1445.5200000000002s)]
*  dealing with the argument, because they have no argument about what they are doing in Palestine. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1452.0800000000002s)]
*  And this is why they want to shut down the conversation any way they can do, even if [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1459.64s)]
*  this would mean hurting or harming me and my family. And it's a huge concern. But [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1466.96s)]
*  it's a price that I need to accept for advocating for the rights of the Palestinian people, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1476.24s)]
*  because once again, this is always a distraction from the genocide in Palestine. And I think [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1488.92s)]
*  that these attempts to silence me are just one way for them to attack us and to cut, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1497.3600000000001s)]
*  just not to let the public know about what Israel is doing and how the U.S. is complicit [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1519.44s)]
*  in this genocide. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1524.8s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil, you led a march from the steps of St. John the Divine up to Columbia University [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1526.24s)]
*  wearing a Palestinian flag as a kind of cape with a thousand supporters there. And you [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1537.04s)]
*  were one of the leaders of the encampment at Columbia that led to so many protests and [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1543.08s)]
*  encampments around the country on university campuses. Many of the protesters were Jewish. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1549.08s)]
*  Many of the supporters for you who would march when you were detained were Jewish. I was [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1556.8s)]
*  wondering what did that level of Jewish support mean to you here in the United States? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1561.84s)]
*  First of all, just a correction. The student movement at Columbia doesn't have leaders. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1569.72s)]
*  I believe all the students equally contribute to the movement. And it's being mobilized [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1581.6s)]
*  by a large number of students, hundreds of students at Columbia University. But going [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1588.6s)]
*  back to your question, Amy, I mean Jewish students are an integral part of the student [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1600.36s)]
*  movement, whether at Columbia or in the United States. And this is very, very important because [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1606.1999999999998s)]
*  these Jewish students, they show the world that what Israel is doing is not in their [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1611.6399999999999s)]
*  name, is not in the name of Jewish safety, which is very important. And these also Jewish [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1616.52s)]
*  students are acting upon their values of protecting the weak or supporting justice. So it's [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1623.44s)]
*  really, to us, it's very important. This shows that the Palestinian cause goes beyond [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1636.76s)]
*  Palestinians, Arabs or Muslims. It's a universal cause for justice, for freedom and for human [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1644.32s)]
*  rights. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1652.24s)]
*  And finally, Mahmoud, as you are free now here in New York, you still face deportation? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1654.72s)]
*  I do. I mean, now I'm out on bail, which means that the court proceedings can continue [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1664.8s)]
*  while I am out. So I'm still facing deportation. However, a judge, a federal judge ruled that [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1674.48s)]
*  the Rubio determination on what Rubio did to me is likely unconstitutional. And that's [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1682.6s)]
*  why he ordered my release on bail. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1691.12s)]
*  So I'm confident that we will prevail in court, that this administration attempts to [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1696.08s)]
*  silence us, wouldn't succeed. And now I will seek accountability. I will seek accountability [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1703.08s)]
*  from this administration, from the individuals and actors who contributed to my arrest, and [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1711.32s)]
*  now exploring these options with my lawyer. Because in the first place, I was protesting [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1718.8s)]
*  for accountability, to hold Colombia and the U.S. government accountable for their complicity [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1726.8s)]
*  in war crimes and genocide against the Palestinians. And I will continue to do so, because what [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1737.1599999999999s)]
*  happened to me shouldn't have happened in the first place. I shouldn't have been prosecuted [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1745.3999999999999s)]
*  simply for my freedom of speech, simply for speaking up for Palestinian rights. And those [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1750.24s)]
*  who have contributed to that in any way should be held accountable. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1756.3600000000001s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1760.3600000000001s)]
*  Columbia University graduate, Palestinian student activist detained by ICE March 8th [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noq2HHqsLpc&t=1764.64s)]
