*  This is it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=58.92s)]
*  Dear Senators, Throughout the past year, people have asked for my thoughts about my cousin [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=59.92s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his presidential campaign. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=65.72s)]
*  I did not comment not only because I was serving in a government position as United States [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=69.64s)]
*  ambassador to Australia, but because I have never wanted to speak publicly about my family [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  members and their challenges. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=79.84s)]
*  We are a close generation of 28 cousins who have been through a lot together. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=82.64s)]
*  We know how hard it's been, and we are always there for each other. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=87.1s)]
*  But now that Bobby has been nominated by President Trump to be secretary of health and human [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=92.4s)]
*  services, a position that would put him in charge of the health of the American people, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=97.12s)]
*  I feel an obligation to speak out. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=103.6s)]
*  Overseeing the FDA, the NIH, the CDC, and centers for Medicare and Medicaid services, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=106.88s)]
*  agencies that are charged with protecting the most vulnerable among us, is an enormous [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=114.56s)]
*  responsibility and one that Bobby is unqualified to fill. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  He lacks any relevant government, financial, management, or medical experience. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=124.96s)]
*  His views on vaccines are dangerous and willfully misinformed. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=130.56s)]
*  These facts alone should be disqualifying. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=135.68s)]
*  But he has personal qualities related to this job, which for me pose even greater concern. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=139.68s)]
*  I've known Bobby my whole life. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=147.68s)]
*  We grew up together. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=149.1s)]
*  It's no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because Bobby himself is a predator. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  He's always been charismatic, able to attract others through the strength of his personality, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  his willingness to take risks and break the rules. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=164.42s)]
*  I watched his younger brothers and cousins follow him down the path of drug addiction. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=168.5s)]
*  His basement, his garage, his dorm room were always the center of the action, where drugs [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=173.42s)]
*  were available and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in a blender [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=178.54s)]
*  to feed to his hawks. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=185.82s)]
*  That was a long time ago and people can change. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=191.1s)]
*  Through his own strength and the many second chances he was given by people who felt sorry [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=194.5s)]
*  for the boy who lost his father, Bobby was able to pull himself out of illness and disease. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=199.64s)]
*  I admire the discipline that took and the continuing commitment it requires. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  But siblings and cousins who Bobby encouraged down the path of substance abuse suffered [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=211.54s)]
*  addiction, illness, and death. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  While Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=220.74s)]
*  Today, while he may encourage a younger generation to attend AA meetings, Bobby is addicted to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=227.14000000000001s)]
*  attention and power. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=234.68s)]
*  Bobby preys on the desperation of parents of sick children, vaccinating his own kids [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=237.5s)]
*  while building a following, hypocritically discouraging other parents from vaccinating [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=243.46s)]
*  theirs. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=247.46s)]
*  Even before he fills this job, his constant denigration of our health care system and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=249.46s)]
*  the conspiratorial half-truths he's told about vaccines, including in connection with [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=255.62s)]
*  Samoa's deadly 2019 outbreak of measles, have cost lives. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=261.7s)]
*  And now we know that Bobby's crusade against vaccination has benefited him in other ways [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=267.64s)]
*  too. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=271.86s)]
*  His ethics report makes clear that he will keep his financial stake in a lawsuit against [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=273.34s)]
*  an HPV vaccine. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=279.53999999999996s)]
*  In other words, Bobby is willing to profit and enrich himself by denying access to a [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  vaccine that can prevent almost all forms of cervical cancer and has already been safely [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=287.78s)]
*  administered to millions of boys and girls. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=294.14s)]
*  During my time in Australia, I worked on the Quad Cancer Initiative, and I learned that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=298.76s)]
*  cervical cancer is among the top three forms of cancer among women in a majority of countries. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=303.44s)]
*  Tragically, every year, more than 200,000 children lose their mothers. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=309.68s)]
*  They are orphaned due to a lack of vaccines and screening. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=316.2s)]
*  Those are the real-world consequences of Bobby's irresponsible beliefs. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  We are a close family, and none of that is easy to say. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=327.0s)]
*  It also wasn't easy to remain silent last year when Bobby expropriated my father's image [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=330.16s)]
*  and distorted President Kennedy's legacy to advance his own failed presidential campaign [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=337.28s)]
*  and then groveled to Donald Trump for a job. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=343.44s)]
*  Bobby continues to grandstand off my father's assassination and that of his own father. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=347.96s)]
*  It is incomprehensible to me that someone who is willing to exploit their own painful [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  family tragedies for publicity would be put in charge of America's life and death situations. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=359.64s)]
*  Unlike Bobby, I try not to speak for my father, but I am certain that he and my Uncle Bobby [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=368.28s)]
*  who gave their lives in public service to our country and my Uncle Teddy who devoted [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=375.26s)]
*  his long-sentimented career to the cause of improving health care would be disgusted. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=380.0s)]
*  The American health care system, for all its flaws, is the envy of the world. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=386.88s)]
*  Its doctors and nurses, researchers, scientists, and caregivers are the most dedicated people [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=392.24s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=397.76s)]
*  Every day, they give their lives to heal and save others. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=399.48s)]
*  They deserve a knowledgeable leader who is committed to evidence and excellence. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=403.28s)]
*  They deserve a secretary committed to advancing cutting-edge medicine to save lives, not [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=409.2s)]
*  to rejecting the advances we have already made. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  They deserve a stable, moral and ethical person at the helm of this crucial agency. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=418.88s)]
*  They deserve better than Bobby Kennedy, and so do the rest of us. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=425.28s)]
*  I urge the Senate to reject his nomination. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=429.44s)]
*  Sincerely, Carolyn Kennedy. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=432.64s)]
*  That was Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s cousin, Carolyn Kennedy, former U.S. ambassador to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=435.48s)]
*  Japan and Australia, daughter of President John F. Kennedy. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=440.6s)]
*  She sent that video and an accompanying letter to the Senate Finance Committee senators. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=444.12s)]
*  RFK's confirmation to be secretary of health and human services begins today in the Senate. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYbHnYhg4I&t=450.92s)]
