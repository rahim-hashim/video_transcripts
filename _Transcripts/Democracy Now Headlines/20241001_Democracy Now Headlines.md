# Top U.S. & World Headlines — October 1, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f7TTAR97nE)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, Democracy Now!
*  .org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The Lebanese Health Ministry says Israeli airstrikes killed at least 95 people and wounded
*  172 others on Monday, as Israel's army said it was carrying out what it called limited
*  and targeted raids into southern Lebanon.
*  Hezbollah, however, denied that Israeli forces had begun an invasion.
*  The conflicting accounts came as Hezbollah fighters fired salvos of rockets into Israel,
*  including attempting to attack the headquarters of Israel's intelligence service, Mossad,
*  outside Tel Aviv.
*  Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Makati says his nation is now facing, quote, one of the
*  most dangerous phases of its history and called on the United Nations to step up aid to one
*  million Lebanese people displaced by Israel's assault.
*  In Washington, President Biden said Monday he wants a ceasefire in Lebanon.
*  However, the Pentagon contradicted his remarks just hours later.
*  A readout of a call between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Israeli Defense Minister
*  Yoav Galant shows the two war leaders, quote, agreed on the necessity of dismantling attack
*  infrastructure along the border, unquote, after headlines will go to Beirut for the
*  latest.
*  Syrian media is reporting an Israeli airstrike on the Syrian capital Damascus killed three
*  civilians, wounded nine others.
*  It was reportedly the third such attack in recent days.
*  The Syrian Arab News Agency said its presenter, Safa Ahmad, was among those killed in Israel's
*  latest air raid.
*  In the Gaza Strip, an Israeli airstrike on a home in the Nusrat refugee camp late Monday
*  killed more than a dozen people.
*  Witnesses say at least seven of the dead were children.
*  They targeted 14 sleeping people, young, adults and children.
*  What can I tell you?
*  They were not doing anything.
*  They were sleeping.
*  On Monday, Israeli authorities released Palestinian surgeon Dr. Khaled al-Sair from prison, months
*  after he was abducted by Israeli forces during a raid on Gaza's Nasser Hospital in March.
*  He's among dozens of doctors, nurses and paramedics held by Israel who, according to
*  Human Rights Watch, have faced widespread torture and abuse in Israeli custody.
*  Half the population of Haiti is now experiencing acute hunger, according to the World Food
*  Program.
*  Roughly five and a half million Haitians are struggling to feed themselves and their families.
*  Millions of mostly displaced Haitians are suffering from catastrophic hunger.
*  This comes as the U.N. Security Council on Monday authorized another year of intervention
*  by an international security force in Haiti amid soaring gang violence.
*  This is World Food Program Haiti director Wanja Kariya.
*  Without food security, we will go into continuously being in that cycle of crisis, poverty, and
*  the cycle will continue.
*  And I don't see food security being given the same importance as, let's say, the security
*  sector.
*  Here in the United States, the death toll from Hurricane Helene has climbed to at least
*  133 people, with hundreds more still unaccounted for.
*  A White House Homeland Security adviser told reporters Monday the death toll could climb
*  as high as 600.
*  Rescue workers are racing to access communities completely cut off by floodwaters and landslides.
*  On Monday, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper toured areas around the mountain city of
*  Asheville, which endured its worst flooding in at least a century.
*  The devastation was beyond belief.
*  And even when you prepare for something like this, this is something that's never happened
*  before in Western North Carolina.
*  On Monday, Donald Trump made the baseless claim that Governor Cooper and President Biden
*  were not helping Republican areas.
*  Trump also falsely claimed Biden did not call Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp
*  to offer hurricane relief.
*  Kemp called out Trump's lie, saying he had spoken to President Biden and praised the
*  federal government's response in Georgia.
*  Meanwhile, in Mexico, at least 22 people have been confirmed dead after Hurricane John ravaged
*  coastal communities in southwestern Mexico last week.
*  In a major win for abortion rights, a judge in Georgia struck down the state's six-week
*  abortion ban Monday, ruling it unconstitutional, ordering authorities to return to laws that
*  were in place before 2022's overturning of Roe v. Wade.
*  Abortions are now legal in Georgia until around 22 weeks of pregnancy, though Monday's ruling
*  will likely be challenged and is expected to land before Georgia's Supreme Court,
*  before a final decision.
*  The Biden administration's further tightened restrictions on the right to apply for asylum,
*  authorities to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border if the number of immigrant apprehensions
*  exceeds a daily average of 1,500.
*  The new asylum ban, which takes effect today, is an expansion of a policy enacted in June
*  that sealed off the southern border when the number of asylum seekers exceeded a daily
*  average of 2,500.
*  As part of the tougher policy, Biden officials are also now counting on all migrant children
*  arriving at the border towards the daily average.
*  The ACLU said in response, quote,
*  Some 45,000 dock workers across the eastern United States and Gulf Coast walked off the
*  job this morning in the first strike of its kind in almost half a century.
*  The International Longshoremen's Association, which represents workers at 36 ports from
*  Maine to Texas, is demanding higher wages and guarantees that jobs won't be automated.
*  This is Daniel Amali, a worker who joined picket lines this morning at Port Elizabeth
*  outside New York City.
*  The ILA is fighting for respect, appreciation and fairness in a world in which corporations
*  are dead set on replacing hardworking people with automation.
*  Employers push automation under the guise of safety, but it is really about cutting
*  labor costs to increase their already exceptionally high profits.
*  On Sunday, President Biden told reporters he will not invoke the anti-union Tapped
*  Hartley Act, which would allow the president to break the strike by ordering an 80-day
*  cooling-off period.
*  We'll have more on the port strike later in the broadcast.
*  Hundreds of tenants in Kansas City, Missouri, have launched a rent strike to protest the
*  state of disrepair of their apartment buildings and demanding protections from corporate landlords.
*  The Tenant Union Federation says renters in North Carolina, Michigan, Illinois, South
*  Carolina, Kentucky, Montana and Illinois may soon start withholding their rents in
*  what could become a coordinated nationwide movement.
*  Rent strikers are also demanding the U.S. government take action, including imposing
*  a federal rent cap.
*  Democracy Now spoke with one of the striking Kansas City tenants.
*  What's happening down here to us in Quality Hill Towers isn't unique.
*  It isn't special.
*  It isn't one-off.
*  This is happening to people all across the country.
*  It's happening to people everywhere in federally backed buildings.
*  If anything, we're the first of a tenant reckoning.
*  There's people organizing all across the country, tenant unions organizing all across
*  the country to get what we need and get what we deserve.
*  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange addressed the parliamentary assembly of the Council
*  of Europe today in his first public remarks since he was released from London's Belmarsh
*  prison in June after pleading guilty to a U.S. charge of obtaining and disclosing national
*  security material.
*  I eventually chose freedom over unrealizable justice after being detained for years and
*  facing a 175-year sentence with no effective remedy.
*  Justice for me is now precluded as the U.S. government insisted in writing into its plea
*  agreement that I cannot file a case at the European Court of Human Rights or even a Freedom
*  of Information Act request over what it did to me as a result of its extradition request.
*  I want to be totally clear.
*  I am not free today because the system worked.
*  I am free today after years of incarceration because I pled guilty to journalism.
*  Julian Assange was speaking in Strasbourg, France.
*  We'll hear more of his comments later in the broadcast.
*  Tomorrow, European lawmakers will vote on a resolution focused on the political and
*  chilling nature of Assange's imprisonment, a draft resolution from the European body
*  also called on the U.S. to investigate the war crimes and human rights abuses revealed
*  by WikiLeaks.
*  And Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will be debating tonight in New York.
*  You can watch the CBS vice presidential debate live streaming at democracynow.org.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
