A last-minute addition to President Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget bill seeks to ban Affordable Care Act healthcare plans from covering abortion, in addition to defunding hundreds of Planned Parenthood clinics that provide reproductive healthcare throughout the United States. “Congress is literally walking us into a crisis of forced birth,” says Mini Timmaraju, president of the advocacy group Reproductive Freedom for All, which is launching a series of campaigns targeting key senators ahead of the Senate vote on the GOP-backed budget bill.

*  You've launched a series of TV ads targeting key senators ahead of the vote on this budget [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=80.9s)]
*  bill. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=87.38s)]
*  In light of what's happening now in Georgia, the six-week ban, give us the map of the country [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  and what this budget bill means. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=94.46s)]
*  Thanks, Amy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=96.9s)]
*  And thank you, Monica, for her incredible work and her team, not just in Georgia but [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=99.58s)]
*  across the country. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=103.22s)]
*  You know, we've got 21 states with extreme abortion bans and restrictions. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=104.22s)]
*  You layer on top of that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=108.98s)]
*  This is the post-Obs reality, right, the map. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=110.7s)]
*  In these states like Georgia, by the way, I want to mention Brian Kemp and Chris Carr, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=113.12s)]
*  they disbanded their statewide maternal mortality, maternal health review commission, and they [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=117.2s)]
*  stopped issuing public reports. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=122.44s)]
*  So you've got this perfect storm across the country of 21 states where they've banned [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=124.9s)]
*  abortion, they've already shut down critical health care systems and clinics, and they've [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  already created this chaotic situation like we're seeing in Georgia and in my home state [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=134.68s)]
*  of Texas. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=138.6s)]
*  Then you talk about gutting Medicaid and potentially defunding Planned Parenthood. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=139.92s)]
*  That would also impact clinics in blue states. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=144.72s)]
*  And this is really important because these blue states have been absorbing the patients. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  These are states that have democratic majorities, super majorities, democratic governors and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=151.76s)]
*  AGs, where they've been boosting up and plusing up, stockpiling Miffy Pristone, medication [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  abortion, telemedicine services, clinic infrastructure in the states. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=161.24s)]
*  But they would be gutted as well. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=165.72s)]
*  Many of them receive Medicaid or they fall under the provision that you mentioned that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=168.16s)]
*  would disconnect abortion care from Medicaid and Medicaid services. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=172.32s)]
*  So we're talking about completely dismantling family planning and abortion care services [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=177.44s)]
*  nationwide at a time where we know we already have a maternal health crisis that particularly [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  impacts women of color. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=190.04s)]
*  But we also have clinics across the country being attacked and patients who need that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=191.84s)]
*  critical care trying to travel from states with bans to other states, particularly the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=197.76s)]
*  blue states. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=202.48s)]
*  So we are literally walking ourselves into Congress, literally walking us into a crisis [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=203.68s)]
*  of forced birth when we have Medicaid services that cover the majority in many parts of this [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=209.48s)]
*  country of births, prenatal care and postpartum care. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=215.2s)]
*  And it's unconscionable and it is deliberate and it is by design. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=219.48s)]
*  And Minnit Tamaraju, what specifically in this so-called big, beautiful bill in terms [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=225.04s)]
*  of the cuts will affect it, especially when it comes to Medicaid, the poorest of our citizens? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=230.64s)]
*  I mean, look, the bill that came out of the House decimates Medicaid. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=240.44s)]
*  It cuts significant funding to provide tax breaks for billionaires. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=245.8s)]
*  There's a couple of things that are going to immediately happen. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=249.96s)]
*  You're going to see clinics, hundreds, Planned Parenthood estimates 200 of their clinics [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=252.84s)]
*  that provide not just abortion care but also general family planning services. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=257.76s)]
*  That's prenatal care, that's postpartum care, that's cancer screenings, that's STI screenings, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  that's well-women visits. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=266.48s)]
*  In many places it's general primary health care and the safety net for health care for [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=268.2s)]
*  many Americans, not just women but all families. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=273.92s)]
*  They're estimating 200 clinics to close nationwide should this bill go down. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=277.6s)]
*  Should this bill pass the Senate? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=283.12s)]
*  In addition, you've got hospital systems lobbying against this bill. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=284.12s)]
*  You've got insurance providers lobbying against this bill because this bill would also just [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=288.8s)]
*  decimate health care infrastructure well beyond family planning services. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=292.56s)]
*  When that happens, the poorest of Americans who need these services, but also a lot of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=296.88s)]
*  Americans who are getting these services who might not realize when they go to Planned [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=301.40000000000003s)]
*  Parenthood and they get the subsidized care, it's actually Medicaid, are going to be forced [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=305.04s)]
*  into our nation's ERs. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  They're going to be forced into other clinics. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=312.36s)]
*  They may not get care at all. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=314.92s)]
*  And that will have a dramatic impact on all Americans, regardless of where you get their [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=316.56s)]
*  health care, because it will decimate the larger health care system in this country. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=320.56s)]
*  We only have 20 seconds. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EFDG8X8fM&t=323.68s)]
