*  This is bird feed. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLzVd89bmA4&t=117.96s)]
*  It's not fit for human consumption. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLzVd89bmA4&t=118.96s)]

*  This was the criminalization of free speech. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLzVd89bmA4&t=312.23999999999995s)]
*  And today, the state of Michigan agrees that you still have the right to speak up. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLzVd89bmA4&t=314.15999999999997s)]

*  The Commission's findings come nearly a decade since his family filed a complaint in 2016. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLzVd89bmA4&t=579.76s)]
*  At the time, Democracy Now! spoke with international human rights lawyer Roxana Altols, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLzVd89bmA4&t=586.96s)]
*  who represented Rojas' wife, Maria Puga, and his family in the case. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLzVd89bmA4&t=592.88s)]
*  ROXANA ALTOLS, U.S. Border Patrol Agent Not a single agent in all of U.S. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLzVd89bmA4&t=597.12s)]
