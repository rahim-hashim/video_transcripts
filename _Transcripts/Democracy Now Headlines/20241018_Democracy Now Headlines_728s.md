# Top U.S. & World Headlines — October 18, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMQiWBfKzbo)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel announced Thursday it killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza.
*  Hamas stopped short of confirming the reports, but a senior member of Hamas' political
*  bureau told the AFP, quote, Israel believes killing our leaders means the end of our movement.
*  These leaders became an icon for future generations to continue the journey towards a free Palestine,
*  unquote.
*  The Israeli military released a video allegedly showing Sinwar's final moments, in which
*  he appears to throw a stick or piece of debris at the Israeli military drone-filming him.
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared, quote, this is not the end of the
*  war in Gaza, unquote, and that Israel would continue its assault until, quote, Hamas lays
*  down its arms and returns our hostages, unquote.
*  It appears Sinwar was not killed as part of a targeted strike, but in the course of Israel's
*  assault on the Gaza Strip.
*  President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris joined other leaders in calling for
*  Sinwar's death to propel a ceasefire.
*  But inside Gaza, Palestinians say past killings of Hamas and other resistance leaders has
*  not ended Israel's brutality.
*  They did not only assassinate Sinwar.
*  They also assassinated Hanye.
*  They assassinated Hassan Nasrallah, and the war did not stop.
*  We are urging for the war to stop.
*  We are not asking for them to assassinate this person or that.
*  They have assassinated most of our leaders, and the war has not stopped.
*  We are calling for the war to stop.
*  Yahya Sinwar became the chief of Hamas's political operations after Israel assassinated
*  his predecessor, Ismail Hanye, in Tehran in July, on the day the Iranian president was
*  inaugurated.
*  In other news from Gaza, Al Jazeera camera operator Fadi Al-Wahidi remains in a coma
*  after he was shot in the neck by an Israeli sniper while reporting in Jabalia earlier
*  this month.
*  Israeli authorities have blocked the evacuation of Al-Wahidi from Gaza, as well as that of
*  fellow Al Jazeera camera person Ali Alatar to receive urgently needed medical treatment.
*  Press freedom groups are demanding that the two Al Jazeera camera people be allowed out
*  of Gaza in order to survive.
*  In the occupied West Bank, mourners gathered for the funeral of Hanan Salameh, a 59-year-old
*  Palestinian woman who was shot dead by Israeli soldiers as she harvested olives on her land
*  in the village of Fakwa near Jenin.
*  At least 757 West Bank Palestinians have been killed by Israel since October 7th of last
*  year.
*  Hanan Salameh's son described his mother's killing.
*  We were picking olives, and Israeli authorities had previously given us a permit to harvest
*  the olives on the condition that we stay away from the fence 100 meters.
*  We were farther than around 100 meters.
*  And when they started shooting, we started packing our stuff and leaving.
*  She was martyred.
*  She was shot by the tractor.
*  We were by the end of the area, far from the fence, and they shot her in cold blood.
*  This is what happened.
*  Earlier today, the U.N. said it's recorded at least 32 attacks by Israeli settlers targeting
*  Palestinians harvesting olives since the start of October.
*  Thirty-nine Palestinians have been injured, and some 600 Palestinian olive trees and saplings
*  were quote, vandalized, sawed off or stolen, unquote.
*  UNIFIL, the U.N. interim force in Lebanon, has reiterated it will remain in place despite
*  ongoing deliberate attacks against its members by Israeli forces.
*  UNIFIL also said it found evidence of possible use of white phosphorus weapons near one of
*  its bases.
*  The use of white phosphorus is illegal.
*  This comes, as Hezbollah says, it's entering a new phase of its fight against Israeli forces
*  that have invaded Lebanon, including the introduction of new weapons.
*  Israel has killed at least 2,400 people in Lebanon and forcibly displaced over 1.34 million
*  people over the past month.
*  President Biden has arrived in Berlin for talks with Western leaders during brief remarks
*  after a meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
*  Biden said his trip was aimed at ensuring NATO remains strong and that Ukraine prevails
*  in its war against Russian occupation.
*  Biden also held Israel's assassination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.
*  Biden's final trip to Europe, as president, comes as several European lawmakers have called
*  for sanctions against Israel over its bloody assaults on Gaza and Lebanon.
*  On Tuesday, far-right Italian Prime Minister Giorgio Maloney revealed Italy has effectively
*  had an arms embargo against Israel in place since its invasion of Gaza last year, with
*  arms export licenses consistently denied.
*  Meanwhile, Ireland's leader, Simon Harris, said he's looking at ways to immediately
*  impose trade sanctions on Israel, following a call by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez
*  and the European Commission to suspend the bloc's free trade agreement with Israel.
*  of hypocrisy from some Spanish lawmakers, who pointed to Spain's weapons deals with
*  Israel since October 7th last year, worth 1 billion euros.
*  This is Spanish parliamentarian Aeoné Bélare, who addressed the Spanish parliament Wednesday
*  while holding a picture of the Palestinian student Shaban al-Alu, who is burned to death
*  in Israel's attack this week on the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Gaza.
*  Last Sunday, Israel did this.
*  They burned dozens of people alive in tents while they were taking refuge in a hospital.
*  What is the difference between this and the Nazi gas chambers?
*  I'm asking you all, Mr. President.
*  There is no difference.
*  And we are complicit as a country in this genocide.
*  Shaban al-Alu's younger brother, Abdulrahman, succumbed to his burn wounds earlier today.
*  We'll go to Dar al-Bala, outside the Al-Aqsa Hospital, where they died, to speak with the
*  Palestinian journalist Abu Bakr Abed about Shaban and his family.
*  Gaza solidarity protests are continuing across the United States, across college campuses
*  in Rhode Island.
*  Students from across the state are traveling to Providence today to join Brown University
*  students in a protest against their school's rejection of their call to divest from Israeli
*  companies complicit in war and occupation.
*  In Illinois, Northwestern University sent in campus police to tear down a sukkah set
*  up by Jewish students.
*  They dedicated to the people of Gaza a sukkah as a temporary booth or hut constructed during
*  the week-long festival of Sukkot.
*  Jewish Voice for Peace Northwestern said, quote,
*  In more protest news earlier this week, peace activists again blockaded the entrance to
*  the Creech Air Force Base in Nevada to oppose the role of U.S. drones in Israel's war
*  on Gaza.
*  A Syrian activist was arrested.
*  The Texas Supreme Court has temporarily halted the planned execution of Robert Robertson,
*  granting him a stunning 11th hour reprieve Thursday, the same day he was set to receive
*  a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.
*  The stay of execution came just hours after a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers voted
*  to subpoena Robertson to appear before a Texas House committee.
*  Their unprecedented move prompted Texas Supreme Court justices to delay Robertson's execution
*  while a lower court resolves a separation of powers conflict raised by the subpoena.
*  Robertson's reprieve came as prison officials in Alabama killed 36-year-old death row prisoner
*  Derek Dearman, forcing a lethal cocktail of three drugs into his veins.
*  He was the 20th prisoner to have been executed this year across eight U.S. states.
*  Ahead of the execution, Dearman's lawyers argued his trial counsel failed to present
*  the jury with information about his lifelong and severe mental illness.
*  A 125 organization sent a letter to the Biden administration asking the U.S. government
*  to end its, quote, diversion and mistreatment of asylum seekers by exiling them to Guantanamo
*  out of reach of their families' advocates, public consciousness and the law, unquote.
*  The letter was organized by the Haitian Bridge Alliance and the International Refugee Assistance
*  Project, which found detained asylum seekers, including children, were being held indefinitely
*  in prison-like conditions with insufficient healthcare and little access to legal assistance.
*  In election news, a federal judge has blocked Alabama's voter roll purge that targeted
*  over 3,000 people Alabama claimed were noncitizens and therefore ineligible to vote.
*  The Justice Department successfully argued the voter purge came too close to the November
*  25 election and included naturalized citizens who are, in fact, able to vote.
*  Meanwhile, Nebraska's Supreme Court has ordered state election officials to comply
*  with a new state law restoring voting rights to people with felony convictions who have
*  completed their sentences.
*  The law had been challenged by Nebraska Republicans, including the attorney general and secretary
*  of state.
*  The delay in implementing the law means thousands of newly eligible voters will have just days
*  to register to vote ahead of an October 25 deadline.
*  In Arizona, pro-Trump super PAC has been mailing older voters a false and misleading mailer
*  proclaiming Medicare cancellation notice, with a return address reading,
*  Department of Medicare Cancellation, Kamala Harris Administration.
*  The MAGA Inc. super PAC did not respond to a request by Mother Jones magazine asking if
*  intended for the mailer to look like an official notice as a scare tactic for seniors.
*  In Wisconsin, voting rights groups have asked the Department of Justice to investigate text
*  messages sent to college-age voters warning them about fines and hefty prison terms with
*  the admonition,
*  Don't vote in a state where you're not eligible, unquote.
*  The League of Women Voters of Wisconsin wrote to Attorney General Merrick Arland, quote,
*  Many students and other young voters are fearful they will face criminal prosecution if they
*  register and exercise their right to vote because of a malicious and accurate text
*  sent by an anonymous party, unquote.
*  And New York prosecutors could soon criminally charge the oil industry for its role in fueling
*  the climate catastrophe.
*  A prosecution memorandum that has been endorsed by elected officials across New York and published
*  by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen reads, quote,
*  Climate disasters are in large part the result of reckless conduct undertaken by major fossil
*  fuel companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron Shell and BP that are responsible for a substantial
*  portion of all the global greenhouse gas emissions that have caused our planet to heat up.
*  This conduct was not just immoral, it was criminal, unquote.
*  Forty cities and states have filed civil lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry in recent
*  years for causing, then covering up, the climate crisis.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
