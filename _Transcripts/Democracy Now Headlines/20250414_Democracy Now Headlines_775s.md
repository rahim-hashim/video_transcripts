As the Pulitzer Prize-winning podcast "Suave" returns for its second season, we speak with journalist Maria Hinojosa and David Luis "Suave" Gonzalez, the subject of the series. Gonzalez was sentenced to life in prison at age 17, but got an unexpected second chance when he was paroled in 2017 following a Supreme Court ruling that found sentences like his unconstitutional. The first season of the podcast followed Gonzalez's case, his decadeslong friendship with Hinojosa and his eventual release from prison. The second season looks at how his freedom is complicated by the long shadow of prison. "I'm on parole for the rest of my life. That's not freedom," Gonzalez tells "Democracy Now!," "If somebody makes a false phone call and says, 'He looked at me wrong, I feel a threat,' I could go back to prison. … When the United States Supreme Court said that it was unconstitutional to keep a juvenile in prison for life, then it should be unconstitutional to keep that same juvenile on parole for life."

*  This is the trailer. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=30.16s)]
*  Suave, so this is the first time that you've been back in the studio. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=31.96s)]
*  How are you feeling? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=38.16s)]
*  Let's get it done. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=39.16s)]
*  It's been seven years since David Luis Suave González was released from prison after being [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=42.16s)]
*  sentenced to serve life without parole as a teenager. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=51.48s)]
*  We're driving away. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=55.519999999999996s)]

*  Suave, we're driving away from greater pain. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  And it was his unexpected friendship with journalist Marielo Rosa that brought this [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=60.04s)]
*  story to a national spotlight. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=65.38s)]
*  Luis Suave González is working hard to give back. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  Do you like it when people call you Mr. Pulitzer? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=71.92s)]
*  Listen, I ain't gonna lie. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=74.08s)]
*  That s*** plays in my ego. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=76.72s)]
*  But not everything is what it seems. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  Being free is not what everybody think it is. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=84.12s)]
*  It's really not. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=87.32s)]
*  Everybody hype it up like, oh, your pains and misery are gone. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=90.32s)]
*  That's bulls***, man. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=94.92s)]
*  My miseries and pains are just starting. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=96.72s)]
*  Because life on the outside means a whole new set of problems. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=100.94s)]
*  From dealing with lifetime parole. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=105.72s)]
*  I can't drink. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=107.84s)]
*  I cannot smoke a little bit of weed. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=108.84s)]
*  I can't travel. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=111.2s)]
*  And I'm like, damn, damn near, everybody here got a gun. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=112.2s)]
*  And I'm like, I gotta get out of here. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  Trailer for season two of Suave. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  As we reported in 2021, the podcast came after Marielo Rosa met Suave while she was giving [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  a talk at the Greater Ford State Correctional Institution in Pennsylvania. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=130.08s)]
*  In fact, Suave was sort of the inspiration for her talk there. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  He was pushing people to get that great Latina journalist into the prison. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=139.32s)]
*  They stayed in touch after they met through letters, visits and phone calls that Marielo [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=145.48s)]
*  recorded. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=152.12s)]
*  Season one included dramatic exchanges like this one, when the Supreme Court ruled it's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=153.12s)]
*  unconstitutional to impose mandatory sentences of life without parole on juveniles. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=160.56s)]
*  The ruling was retroactive and gave thousands of people, including Suave, a chance at freedom. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=167.68s)]
*  This is a clip of the call. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=174.48s)]
*  This is Suave's call to Maria to announce the good news. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=176.44s)]
*  Thank you for using Securus. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=181.08s)]
*  You may start the conversation now. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=184.32s)]
*  Hello? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=186.32s)]
*  Hello? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=187.32s)]
*  Hello, Maria. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=188.32s)]
*  How are you doing this morning? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=189.32s)]
*  It is Friday, June 9th at 1044 in the morning. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=194.48s)]
*  I thought we were going to talk it too. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=195.48s)]
*  What happened? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=196.48s)]
*  I wanted to let you know that the judge told the lawyer this morning we don't have to wait [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=197.48s)]
*  no longer. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=202.48s)]
*  June 26th, 17 days from today, we bring him to court so he can go see Pedro in July. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=203.48s)]
*  What? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=213.48s)]
*  So, it's like totally not a normal day for you in prison after 30 years. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=215.48s)]
*  Today is— [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=222.48s)]
*  And last night, you won't even imagine, I had a dream that I was eating Chinese food. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=226.48s)]
*  What were you eating? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=232.48s)]
*  Egg roll and some pork fried rice. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=234.48s)]
*  And then I woke up and I'm in here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=237.48s)]
*  So, that's David Luis Suave González in Season 1 of the Pulitzer Prize-winning podcast [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=242.48s)]
*  Suave. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=248.48s)]
*  I mean, it's more than being in a podcast, that incredible moment when he learns after [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=249.48s)]
*  31 years he could be free. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=254.76s)]
*  Season 2 begins this week, and Suave is now an artist and author of a new book, Just Out, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=258.48s)]
*  titled From Prison to the Pulitzer Prizes. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=265.48s)]
*  He's joining us in our studio for more, along with Mariana Josa, co-executive producer [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=268.48s)]
*  of Suave, founder of Futuro Media, host of Latino USA. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=275.48s)]
*  We welcome you both back to Democracy Now! [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=280.48s)]
*  It's great to have you with us. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=283.48s)]
*  Congratulations on the Pulitzer Prize once again, that 2022 Pulitzer Prize. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=286.48s)]
*  Suave, in Season 1, I mean, this fact that we're following you for decades in prison, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=291.48s)]
*  and then you're free, but it hasn't been so easy. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=298.48s)]
*  Talk about what freedom means to you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=303.48s)]
*  Freedom means to me being off parole. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=307.48s)]
*  Currently I'm on parole for the rest of my life. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=310.48s)]
*  That's not freedom. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=313.48s)]
*  That's reporting to somebody, my move of being monitored by the DOC. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=315.48s)]
*  That's not freedom. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=320.48s)]
*  A lot of people think you home, you got a good job, you got good friends. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=321.48s)]
*  Yes, but I'm not really free. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=325.48s)]
*  You know, there was this thing that Maria used to tell me when I was in prison. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=328.48s)]
*  You're in the big prison and the little prison. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=331.48s)]
*  I was in the little prison when I was inside, because I expected to have all my phone calls monitored. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=334.48s)]
*  I expected to have every move monitored, but I come home, I wasn't expecting this. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=339.48s)]
*  I was expecting to report to somebody, I need to go across city lines. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=344.48s)]
*  Cannot go. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=349.48s)]
*  I need to go shopping. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=350.48s)]
*  This place cannot go. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=351.48s)]
*  I need to travel. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=352.48s)]
*  Cannot go. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=353.48s)]
*  And if they feel like they don't want to give you permission, they can say no. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=354.48s)]
*  You know, so that's not freedom. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=359.48s)]
*  To me, freedom means totally free, being able to do what I want to do in life. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=360.48s)]
*  If I want to drink, being able to have a beer if I want to have a beer, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=365.48s)]
*  being able to smoke a joint if I want to smoke a joint. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=369.48s)]
*  Even though I don't. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=371.48s)]
*  But if I want to, I can't, because I could get violated and get put back in prison. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=372.48s)]
*  If somebody make a false phone call and say, well, he looked at me wrong, I feel threatened, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=378.48s)]
*  I could go back to prison. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=383.48s)]
*  That's not freedom. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=384.48s)]
*  When the United States Supreme Court said that it was unconstitutional to keep a juvenile [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=385.48s)]
*  in prison for life, then it should be unconstitutional to keep that same juvenile on parole for life. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=390.48s)]
*  I want to go to another aspect of being out of prison, to a clip from season two with [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=395.48s)]
*  Maria and Suave exploring how to build friendships after being incarcerated for over three decades. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=403.48s)]
*  After years trying to decipher their relationship, pen pals, interviewer, interviewee, creative [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=409.48s)]
*  collaborators, Maria and Suave have been saying the F word openly now, friendship. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=417.48s)]
*  Although, what does it actually mean? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=424.48s)]
*  I recently asked both Suave and Maria to give me their own definitions of friendship. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=427.48s)]
*  Friends are basically someone who you would be prepared to take a bullet for. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=433.48s)]
*  A friend is somebody who you have deep communication with on multiple layers of your life and where [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=440.48s)]
*  there is deep love and respect. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=448.48s)]
*  First of all, I can't describe it because I don't know what friendship is. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=451.48s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=455.48s)]
*  I have a lot of people that I associate with, but when it comes to friends, I don't even know what that is [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=456.48s)]
*  because I come from a place where there is no friends. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=463.48s)]
*  In this friendship in particular between Maria and Suave, it's had some highs, but also it's had some really rough spots. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=469.48s)]
*  If you want to go there, you want to know what? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=478.48s)]
*  You didn't call me. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=490.48s)]
*  You're going to apologize to me. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=492.48s)]
*  I'm Maria and all of a sudden nobody goes to me. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=494.48s)]
*  And that's when I said to him, I was like, no one treats me this way Suave, no one. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=496.48s)]
*  Friendship or intimacy in general, for that matter, has been one of the biggest challenges for Suave since getting out of prison. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=503.48s)]
*  How to connect with someone, how to be vulnerable, how to be open. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=511.48s)]
*  All of these things that he never really had to think about because in prison it was so important to protect himself, to close himself off from other people. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=516.48s)]
*  Someone that's been in prison for decades, it's going to take a long time to gain that trust because in the back of my mind, always going to be, if I ever get locked up, will you stick by me? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=527.48s)]
*  That's Suave. It's the second season. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=545.48s)]
*  That voice also, Julieta Martinelli, who is the host of this series. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=548.48s)]
*  Maria, you did the first series. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=554.48s)]
*  You both won the Pulitzer Prize. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=557.48s)]
*  So why the second series? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=559.48s)]
*  And at the end of it, Suave is freed. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=561.48s)]
*  So we didn't know that there was going to be a season two to Suave. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=565.48s)]
*  And we never, I mean, I didn't expect to win the Pulitzer Prize and an IDA award. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=569.48s)]
*  Suave and I have this strange thing, which is that we record every single phone call that we make. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=575.48s)]
*  It's just part of who we are. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=581.48s)]
*  That is part of our relationship, journalist source and friends. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=583.48s)]
*  Maria, FBI and Hossa. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=586.48s)]
*  So we didn't know there was going to be a season two. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=588.48s)]
*  Thanks to the Mellon Foundation and the president, Elizabeth Alexander, the great poet, they believed in the project and they said we want a season two. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=596.48s)]
*  And we actually, season two, Amy, is so dramatic. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=605.48s)]
*  And as soon as I finished binging on season two, I called up Suave and I said, thank you. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=609.48s)]
*  Thank you for telling your story for everyone to hear. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=614.48s)]
*  It is incredibly dramatic. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=618.48s)]
*  Suave is incredibly vulnerable. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=620.48s)]
*  And we are asking that question about what is freedom? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=621.48s)]
*  What is happiness? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=625.48s)]
*  And what 31 years behind bars, seven of them in solitary confinement, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=627.48s)]
*  what it looks like when you get on the outside? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=633.48s)]
*  Seven of the 31 in solitary confinement. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=635.48s)]
*  You get out. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=637.48s)]
*  You are free. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=639.48s)]
*  People are saying, how does it feel to be free? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=640.48s)]
*  You don't feel free. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=642.48s)]
*  And you have a mental breakdown. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=644.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=646.48s)]
*  You're going to hear that in season two. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=648.48s)]
*  Yeah, because I really never had treatment. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=650.48s)]
*  I never really went to therapy after incarceration to deal with the trauma. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=654.48s)]
*  So I come home, you know, I'm living to other people's expectations, not my expectations. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=659.48s)]
*  I want to fit in. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=664.48s)]
*  And this is the problem of people that serve a lot of years in prison. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=665.48s)]
*  They come home, they want to fit in. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=669.48s)]
*  They say yes to everything. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=671.48s)]
*  And not knowing that what we're doing is re-traumatizing ourself. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=673.48s)]
*  A lot of us are not ready to fit in to normal society. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=677.48s)]
*  We need treatment. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=680.48s)]
*  The DOC, the Department of Correction, need to at least take ownership. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=682.48s)]
*  They need to take ownership for a lot of people coming home untreated. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=688.48s)]
*  And trauma is real. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=693.48s)]
*  And you're going to hear that in season two when my car was stolen, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=695.48s)]
*  that I was just triggered to a space that nobody wanted to be in. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=698.48s)]
*  And I realized that I need help. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=704.48s)]
*  And I went to therapy because it was affecting my life. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=706.48s)]
*  It was affecting my family's life, the people that love me. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=709.48s)]
*  And then I started getting phone calls from people. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=712.48s)]
*  It's like I'm going through the same thing. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=716.48s)]
*  But they're ashamed to speak about it because I don't want you to think I'm crazy [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=718.48s)]
*  because I'm going through a crisis. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=723.48s)]
*  You know, I want to live up to that expectation. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=725.48s)]
*  I'm a Pulitzer Prize winner. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=727.48s)]
*  I'm this. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=729.48s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I'm human. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=730.48s)]
*  And I'm a person that served 31 years incarcerated without ever seeing a therapist. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=732.48s)]
*  And we're going to do part two and post online at democracynow.org. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=737.48s)]
*  We're also going to do an interview in Spanish, where you can go to our Spanish website, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=742.48s)]
*  link to it at democracynow.org. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCMLbqLI2CE&t=746.48s)]
