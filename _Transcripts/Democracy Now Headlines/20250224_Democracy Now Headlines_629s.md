Friedrich Merz is poised to become the next German chancellor after his conservative Christian Democratic Union placed first in Sunday’s key election. Social scientist David Bebnowski, speaking from Berlin, tells Democracy Now! that Merz is likely to join with the diminished SPD of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz for another “grand coalition” of establishment parties, which has ruled Germany for much of the last couple decades. He also comments on the alarming rise of the “Nazi-curious” AfD party, which was endorsed by Elon Musk and made significant gains in the election, winning the second-most votes. “The AfD is a party that is definitely part of the extreme right in Germany,” Bebnowski says.

# Conservatives Win German Election, But Far-Right “Nazi-Curious” AfD Places Second in Historic Rise
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg)
*  Democracy depends on a free press. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=0.0s)]
*  Please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=2.4s)]
*  As the world marks three years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, we begin today's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=6.0s)]
*  show in Germany, where Friedrich Merz appears set to become the next German chancellor after [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=11.96s)]
*  his conservative Christian Democratic Union, CDO, placed first in Sunday's anticipated [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=17.32s)]
*  election. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=22.6s)]
*  Merz has vowed to back Ukraine in its defense against Russia's war and has signaled a [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=23.6s)]
*  seismic shift in Europe's relations with the United States and President Trump's second [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=28.84s)]
*  term and his government's growing rift with the European Union. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=33.08s)]
*  Merz spoke to German public broadcaster ARD Sunday. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=37.36s)]
*  My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that step [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  by step we can really achieve independence from the United States. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=49.1s)]
*  I never thought I would have to say something like this on a television program, but after [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=53.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's statements last week at the latest, it is clear the Americans, at least [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  this part of the Americans, this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=64.44s)]
*  Germany's election comes as the Trump administration has been in direct talks with Moscow to reach [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=70.16s)]
*  an agreement that would end the war in Ukraine without including representatives Ukraine [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=75.52s)]
*  or European nations at the table. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=80.64s)]
*  Trump's White House has also vowed to scale back U.S. military support and troop numbers [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=83.32s)]
*  in Europe. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=87.84s)]
*  Merz has questioned the future of NATO and has suggested Europe may need to devise a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=88.84s)]
*  new independent defense structure to replace the military alliance. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=93.36s)]
*  Ahead of Sunday's election in Germany, U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and Elon Musk came [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=97.96s)]
*  out in support of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AFD, party, which revels in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=102.4s)]
*  Nazi slogans and anti-immigrant racism. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  AFD placed second, nearly doubling its support since the 2021 German election, the strongest [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=112.04s)]
*  showing for a far-right party since World War II. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=118.76s)]
*  Musk reportedly congratulated the AFD on the results. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, Vance met with AFD's leader during a trip to Munich earlier this month. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=126.4s)]
*  The Socialist Democratic Party, led by outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, placed third. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=132.0s)]
*  Scholz urged no future government coalition should partner with AFD. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=137.56s)]
*  No cooperation with the extreme right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=142.2s)]
*  The Socialist Democratic Party stands by this clear course, and we hope and believe that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  all others will continue to show this attitude in the coming years. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=151.56s)]
*  That an extreme right party like the AFD gets such election results in this country, this [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  should never be something we will come to terms with. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=162.56s)]
*  I will never reconcile myself to this. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=165.44s)]
*  For more, we go to Berlin, where we're joined by David Bebnowski, contemporary historian [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=168.08s)]
*  and social scientist at the American Institute at the Ludwig Maximilian University Munich. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=173.24s)]
*  He's the author of a book about AFD. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=178.96s)]
*  Welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=181.84s)]
*  First, your response to the Sunday election in Germany. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=183.28s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=187.24s)]
*  Yeah, my response is that we saw, of course, a victory by the CDU, of the CDU. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=191.08s)]
*  We saw a strong showing by the AFD. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=199.32s)]
*  We saw a considerably stronger showing of the left party, really the surprise of this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=202.2s)]
*  election. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=206.8s)]
*  And I think the CDU and the AFD did not achieve completely what they wanted to achieve. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=208.12s)]
*  Of course, it's a complete washout almost for the SPD coming in with the weakest election [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=213.96s)]
*  results in federal elections in Germany and the Green Party as another member of the coalition [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=222.28s)]
*  of the traffic light coalition, as we say in Germany, given the colorings of the several [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=227.72s)]
*  parties that formed that coalition, also lost considerably. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=235.56s)]
*  And yeah, the FDP, the free Democrats, traditionally one of the parties that was often part of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=240.12s)]
*  governments in Germany, yeah, was lost considerably, was kicked out of the Bundestag, of the German [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=250.12s)]
*  parliament. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=257.04s)]
*  And the Bündnisarer Wagenknecht, another party that formed as a breakaway group of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=258.44s)]
*  the left party, did not make it to the Bundestag, which also was surprising to many. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=264.12s)]
*  I wanted to turn to the German parliament Green Party member, Renat Gronast, who responded [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=269.48s)]
*  to the incoming election results. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=277.64s)]
*  There is pressure and danger coming from Russia on the EU, so to speak. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=281.68s)]
*  The way U.S. President Donald Trump is acting now, and Vice President J.D. Vance and Elon [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=285.68s)]
*  Musk, it's like they want to turn us into vassals. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=291.12s)]
*  So the big challenge now is to build an independent Europe that is capable of acting relatively [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=294.48s)]
*  quickly, that sets its own goals again. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=299.4s)]
*  That is now the big challenge. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=302.36s)]
*  So the question is, who will the conservative party, Hubertz, form a government with? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=304.12s)]
*  The right or the left? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=310.84s)]
*  Well, the party will form a coalition, and this is pretty clear, as was the expected [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=313.32s)]
*  result actually from this election. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=321.4s)]
*  Most likely the government will be a grand coalition, as we say in Germany, between the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=323.92s)]
*  SPD, so the Social Democratic Party, and the CDU, so Friedrich Merz, who will most likely [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=330.36s)]
*  be in charge of the government, and who will be elected chancellor, most likely. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=335.68s)]
*  So we refer to this kind of coalition as a grand coalition, because traditionally, of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=341.92s)]
*  course, the SPD and the CDU were the greatest and the strongest parties in German parliament. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=348.24s)]
*  And the SPD is not anymore. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=354.04s)]
*  The SPD came in third last night. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=355.64s)]
*  The AfD came in second. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=358.04s)]
*  But there's no way that I think the public would allow for a government between the AfD [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=360.36s)]
*  and the CDU at that time. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=369.08s)]
*  And who would you compare? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=370.52s)]
*  Which party do you think is closest to the Trump administration, to Vance, who didn't [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=372.64s)]
*  meet with Schultz but did meet with the AfD, quite remarkably? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=378.44s)]
*  Of course, we know Elon Musk is Nazi salute and also supporting the AfD. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=382.68s)]
*  But you have Merz, who is the leader of the Christian Democratic Party, which has vowed [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=387.92s)]
*  to crack down on immigrants and business regulation. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=395.0s)]
*  Is the Trump-Vance-Musk administration closer to the Christian Democratic Union or the AfD? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=399.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, I think the Mager movement definitely is closer to the AfD. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=409.32s)]
*  And this is what we were able to see. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, on the show, you already referred to JD Vance meeting up with Alice Weidel and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=416.36s)]
*  not with Chancellor Olaf Scholz, which is, of course, a break of protocol. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=422.6s)]
*  Really, just going against traditional norms and against the just strong ties between the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=426.92s)]
*  US and Germany historically. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=434.36s)]
*  And the significance of this, David, the significance of this for people to understand that Vance [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=438.0s)]
*  spoke at the Munich Security Conference and he met not with the chancellor, but with the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=444.24s)]
*  far-right—you could either call it neo-Nazi or Nazi-curious party. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=449.72s)]
*  And this is 100 years after Hitler came out of prison and he held what was really considered [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=454.04s)]
*  his first huge rally, 3,000 people at a beer hall right there in Munich. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=460.76s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=468.36s)]
*  I mean, you can see all these symbols, all these things that happen in history, and you [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  can connect the dots if you like. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=475.16s)]
*  And yeah, it's good to remember these things and the significance of these acts. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=477.68s)]
*  And yeah, Nazi-curious, that's maybe the term we should stick to. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=483.08000000000004s)]
*  I think the AfD is a party that is definitely part of the extreme right in Germany, at least [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=488.6s)]
*  partially to a considerable degree. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=493.48s)]
*  There might be other members in the party that do not—that formally might not agree [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=495.64000000000004s)]
*  with everything that the extreme right in Germany, the far-right, would say, but still [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=501.88s)]
*  they tolerate how the party has evolved over the last years and what it stands for now. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=507.0s)]
*  So there's no doubt about that. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=511.96000000000004s)]
*  And David Babnowski, as we speak on this third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  of Ukraine, and Western leaders meet with Zelensky in Kiev. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=520.0s)]
*  Macron is meeting with President Trump at the White House, and he will be followed by [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=527.8000000000001s)]
*  Starmor, the British prime minister, on Thursday at the White House. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=534.2800000000001s)]
*  Can you talk about the stance of Germany now when it comes to Russia's war in Ukraine? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=539.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think in Germany there is strong support for Ukraine and supporting the Ukrainian defense [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=547.6s)]
*  against Russia. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=556.6s)]
*  And this is something that we would see in a coalition by the SPD and the CDU. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=558.6s)]
*  However, the AfD has definitely a different standpoint on that, and they would agree with [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=563.8000000000001s)]
*  Trump and Vance in coming to terms with Russia without having Ukraine or Europe at the table. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=571.72s)]
*  Actually, Alice Weidel, so the chairwoman of the AfD, came out yesterday and said that [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=577.52s)]
*  Trump was doing the right thing and that Trump was doing what the AfD was calling for all [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=582.9200000000001s)]
*  along. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=587.9200000000001s)]
*  And so from that point of view, you see that there's a really just a very, very decidedly [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=588.9200000000001s)]
*  standpoint towards Russia-Ukraine relations against the war, from the AfD then to almost [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=598.2s)]
*  every party from political mainstream in Germany. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=605.0s)]
*  David Bednowski, we thank you so much for being with us, contemporary historian, social [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFe_VDL6xg&t=608.8000000000001s)]
