# Top U.S. & World Headlines — August 28, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spVNHYr7FBE)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  At least nine Palestinians were killed overnight as Israel's military cowered out its largest
*  raid in the occupied West Bank in two decades.
*  Israeli soldiers, backed by armored vehicles, bulldozers, fighter jets and drones, launched
*  simultaneous raids on Jenin, Tukaram and Tubas.
*  The Palestinian Red Crescent Society reports Jenin's three main hospitals were besieged
*  with Israeli soldiers barring ambulances from transporting the wounded.
*  Other witnesses described Israeli bulldozers destroying roads, water and power infrastructure.
*  As the raid got underway, Israel's foreign minister, Israel Katz, called for the mass
*  displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank.
*  on social media, quote,
*  "'We need to deal with the threat exactly as we deal with terror infrastructure in Gaza,
*  including the temporary evacuation of Palestinian civilians and any other step needed.
*  This is a war for everything and we must win it,' Israel's foreign minister wrote.
*  Palestinian health officials say Israeli raids on the West Bank since October have killed
*  over 650 Palestinians, 148 of them children.
*  Their headlines will go to the occupied West Bank, to Ramallah for the latest.
*  Israeli attacks on the central and southern Gaza Strip have killed dozens of Palestinians
*  over the past day.
*  Among the dead are six people who were killed when an Israeli airstrike tore through residential
*  buildings in the city of Qanyunas.
*  A house was bombed, filled with residents.
*  It had about 100 people in it, displaced people who came from Ra'afa and the cities
*  around Qanyunas.
*  They were all bombed by F-16s.
*  They were all children and women, all children who have no relation to the resistance or
*  anything else.
*  The Israeli military is committing a genocide."
*  In another attack, Israeli forces struck a school sheltering displaced people in Dar al-Balakh,
*  killing eight Palestinians.
*  And earlier today, forces killed Palestinian photojournalist Mohammed Abderrabo and his
*  sister in an airstrike on their home in the Nusayrat refugee camp.
*  The Palestinian Journalist Syndicate says Israel has killed at least 161 media workers
*  since October 7.
*  On Tuesday, the United Nations warned Israel's continued assault on Gaza has severely hampered
*  aid efforts and is disrupting plans to launch a mass vaccination campaign against polio
*  next week.
*  Israeli forces in Gaza have rescued a Bedouin Arab Muslim man who'd been kidnapped on
*  October 7.
*  On Tuesday, Israeli soldiers said they found Qaid Faham al-Qadhi alone underground in a
*  tunnel.
*  He's the eighth hostage to be rescued.
*  In Ukraine, at least six people were killed Tuesday as Russia's military continued a
*  barrage of drone and missile attacks on critical infrastructure.
*  Ukrainian officials have called the recent strikes the largest aerial assault since Russia's
*  invasion in 2022.
*  Among the dead are four people who were buried under the rubble of a hotel flattened by a
*  Russian missile in the city of Krivivri.
*  On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he hoped to present President
*  Biden with a plan for victory next month when he visits the United States for the U.N. General
*  Assembly.
*  Zelensky said he'd also share the proposal with Vice President Kamala Harris and former
*  President Donald Trump.
*  But Zelensky ruled out any immediate ceasefire with Russia.
*  There can be no compromises with Putin.
*  Dialogue today is in principle empty and meaningless because he does not want to end the war diplomatically.
*  He does not want it.
*  He pretends to be ready for a diplomatic way, but under the condition of giving him 30 percent
*  of our land.
*  The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency is warning of the heightened risk
*  of a nuclear catastrophe after Ukrainian soldiers press their counteroffensive deeper into Russia
*  and close to the Kursk nuclear power plant.
*  On Monday, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said after a tour of the aging nuclear facility that
*  Ukraine and Russia must cease fighting around all nuclear sites, including Kursk, and the
*  Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine.
*  Grossi warned the Soviet-era Kursk nuclear plant's reactors are not protected by the
*  sort of containment domes typically found in modern nuclear facilities, making them
*  especially vulnerable to damage from missiles or artillery fire.
*  A comparison like this equating Chernobyl with Kursk, I think, is an exaggeration.
*  But, but, this is the same type of reactor, and there is no specific protection.
*  And this is very, very important.
*  In Afghanistan, the Taliban has approved a wide-ranging morality law that forces women
*  to completely cover their bodies and remain silent in public.
*  The law will be enforced by the so-called morality police, who work under the Ministry
*  for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Ice.
*  The law codifies many rules that have been in place since the Taliban returned to power
*  three years ago.
*  The law has been widely condemned.
*  This is Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
*  Human Rights.
*  These are partners who are being completely silenced, and they're attempting to render
*  them into shadows.
*  Their voices are no longer permissible.
*  Education is no longer permissible.
*  You cannot even see their faces.
*  This needs to stop, and we need to continue talking about it.
*  We need to continue advocating for it and putting pressure on the authorities to listen.
*  Afghan women have been defying the Taliban's edicts and videos posted on social media
*  or shared with human rights groups.
*  This is a woman living inside Afghanistan who concealed her identity as she recorded
*  herself singing,
*  You have silenced my voice until further notice.
*  You have imprisoned me in my home for the crime of being a woman.
*  In India, protests are continuing over the rape and murder of a young medical student
*  in a Kolkata hospital earlier this month.
*  On Tuesday, police fired water cannons and tear gases.
*  Thousands marched in Kolkata to demand the resignation of West Bengal's chief minister.
*  In news from Washington, D.C., special counsel Jack Smith has filed a revised indictment
*  against Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.
*  Trump faces the same criminal charges in the case, but Smith reworked parts of the original
*  indictment after the Supreme Court granted Trump broad immunity for official acts he
*  took as president.
*  The case is not expected to go to trial before the November election.
*  In campaign news, Donald Trump's added two former Democrats to his transition team,
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Hawaii congressmember Tulsi Gabbard.
*  Kennedy suspended his independent presidential campaign this weekend, but his name will likely
*  remain on the ballot in some states.
*  Kennedy is reportedly aiming to become secretary of health and human services if Trump is elected.
*  Kennedy, who was once a prominent environmental lawyer, is a leading figure in the anti-vaccine
*  movement.
*  He has endorsed Trump despite once calling him a, quote, terrible president.
*  And in Mexico, Presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador has paused relations with the U.S.
*  and Canadian embassies after the two countries criticized Mexico's efforts to reform its
*  judiciary system.
*  Part of the reform calls for judges to be elected by popular vote.
*  Mexico's president-elect, Claudia Sheinbaum, who will take office October 1st, defended
*  the proposed changes.
*  What's best, justices of the Supreme Court elected by the Senate and the Republic or
*  by the people of Mexico?
*  Who says the people of Mexico?
*  Raise your hand.
*  This is democracy, democracy to elect the president, democracy for lawmakers and democracy
*  for the judiciary, too, so that it is a judiciary at the service of the people.
*  Last week, U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar criticized Mexico's judicial reform proposal, saying,
*  quote, popular direct election of judges is a major risk to the functioning of Mexico's
*  democracy.
*  And those are some of the headlines.

*  I am Amy Goodman in New York, joined by Juan González in Chicago.
*  Hi, Juan.
*  Hi, Amy, and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around
*  the world.
