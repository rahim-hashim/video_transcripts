**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyKo8m-tV-U)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The U.S. Senate has approved a $95 billion foreign and military aid package to help Ukraine,
*  Israel and Taiwan.
*  The bill also included a provision that could lead to a ban on TikTok.
*  This is Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
*  Mr. President, today, the Senate sends a unified message to the entire world.
*  Israel will always defend democracy in its hour of need.
*  We tell our allies, we will stand with you.
*  We tell our adversaries, don't mess with us.
*  We tell the world, we will do everything to defend democracy and our way of life.
*  The final vote in the Senate was 79 to 18.

*  We are now in the absurd situation where Israel is using U.S. military assistance to block
*  the delivery of U.S. humanitarian aid to Palestinians.
*  If that is not crazy, I don't know what is, but it's also a clear violation of U.S.
*  law.
*  Given that reality, we should not today even be having this debate.
*  It is illegal to continue current military aid to Israel, let alone send another $9 billion
*  with no strings attached.

*  clarity and information, and that's where I'm at.
