A massacre of dozens of starving Palestinians waiting for aid occurred at a site operated by the shadowy Gaza Humanitarian Foundation over the weekend. It is exactly what many observers warned about when they expressed skepticism over the U.S.- and Israel-backed aid scheme. "It's not a real organization," says Eyad Amawi, a coordinator for local NGOs based in Gaza who accuses the Israeli military of using the slow trickle of aid it allows into southern Gaza "as a tool to increase suffering."

*  here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=66.48s)]
*  As you mentioned, and I mentioned in my piece in The Guardian, the GHF organization, it's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=67.48s)]
*  not a real organization, from my observation as an expert in the NGOs and coordination [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=73.4s)]
*  here. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  They made chaos, creative chaos, that they use it as a tool to increase the suffering. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=80.6s)]
*  What I have seen yesterday, and the casualties that come from the Rafah and from the Nisarim [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=88.52s)]
*  Access Point also, a lot of casualties, they have served for more than 90 days, and they [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=96.52s)]
*  went there to seek foods, and they are surprised by the airplanes and the drones and the bombing [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=103.24s)]
*  of smoking. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=111.6s)]
*  That's a horrible time, as I witnessed here with a lot of people. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=112.6s)]
*  The testimony is horrible. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=117.28s)]
*  Look, they use—nothing exists over the ground. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=119.08s)]
*  When we compare their works with another UN organization that is related to the international [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  community, nothing here exists over the ground. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=130.56s)]
*  From my observation, this is—they use this as a tool to increase suffering. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=134.16s)]
*  You can imagine when the elderly people and the child here cannot achieve that long, far [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=141.2s)]
*  paces and with the danger and the threat in their life to go to get some foods from there. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=149.36s)]
*  A lot of—thousands of people here will not get a chance to achieve any amount of foods. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  Even thought what they announce in the media and Facebook pages, our people here have recognized [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=165.52s)]
*  reality, and there's no choice without the UN organization to intervene directly with [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=174.08s)]
*  unconditional aid to come into the Gaza. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=185.2s)]
*  We have in time. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  From my statistics, I have the indication that more 60,000 children will die by this [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=190.56s)]
*  increase in suffering and by famine. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=201.28s)]
*  There is no sweet-waters here, so there is no time to accept the claimings for the GHF [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=203.76s)]
*  or other parties that they will distribute the food for 2.5 million people here in Gaza. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=209.92s)]
*  The time is maybe ended at any time. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=216.48s)]
*  Our children here come to the ER, as Victoria mentioned, with messianated bodies. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  They haven't any ability to walk in the street. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=227.04s)]
*  I swear, our children here haven't ability to walk just a few meters. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=233.44s)]
*  So from my observation here, we haven't time to still waiting the GHF to establish [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=239.2s)]
*  another warehouses, and all of our NGOs community refuse to deal with them. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=247.28s)]
*  They haven't any database. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=253.68s)]
*  They have no system, no rules. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=255.36s)]
*  Randomizing the distribution systems cause the chaos that is still happening at their stations. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=257.6s)]
*  You can imagine when the GHF bought their warehouses, especially Al-Rafah, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=265.68s)]
*  and Nitserim Axis, this is close to the military bases that related to the Israeli occupation [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=270.24s)]
*  forces, and they protect them. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=276.48s)]
*  What's happening yesterday at the mosque, adding to the previous mosque. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=278.88s)]
*  This situation must stop now. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  The ceasefire must be implemented to enable us to save our children lives and our people lives. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN, HOST, The New Israel-Backed Aid for Gaza [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=291.92s)]
*  Eyad Amawi, I want to thank you so much for being with us. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  Coordinator for local NGOs based in Gaza will link to your piece for The Guardian, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  headlined, I've seen the reality of the New Israel-Backed Aid for Gaza. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=304.72s)]
*  It's nothing more than a deadly PR stunt. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyTKNc18zw&t=310.0s)]
