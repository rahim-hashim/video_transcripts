*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In Gaza, Israeli forces are continuing to attack Ra'a amidst growing outrage over
*  its bombing of a tent camp for displaced Palestinians, which killed 45 people Sunday, including children,
*  A harrowing video emerged showing a man desperately holding up the charred corpse of a headless
*  Palestinian child amidst the still-blazing flames of the attack.
*  The Tal al-Sultan neighborhood had been specifically designated as a safe humanitarian area in
*  Ra'a.
*  This is Abed Mohammed Alatar, whose brother and several other relatives were killed in
*  the attack.
*  The army is a liar.
*  The occupation army is a liar.
*  There is no security in Gaza.
*  There's no security, not for a child, an elderly man or for a woman.
*  Here he is with his wife.
*  They were martyred.
*  They're gone.
*  The decision of the world court is a lie.
*  They're still killing.
*  They're planes 24 hours a day.
*  They are martyrs and killings all the time.
*  They are wounded and injuries, children becoming orphaned, innocent people.
*  They haven't done anything.
*  They were displaced from one place to another, looking for a living.
*  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the Israeli bombing a tragic mistake
*  and said they'll investigate.
*  We'll go to Ra'a for more after headlines.
*  Just one day earlier on Saturday, displaced Gazans sheltering at the Al-Nasla school in
*  Gaza City were hit by an Israeli airstrike that killed at least 10 people.
*  What do the children have to do with this?
*  They scattered us from here to there.
*  Where should we go?
*  Have mercy on us.
*  Have mercy on us.
*  What did he do to get blown to pieces like this?
*  The official death toll in Gaza has now topped 36,000.
*  The Rafah massacre came just two days after the International Court of Justice ordered
*  Israel to immediately stop its assault on Rafah.
*  The court considers that, in conformity with obligations under the Genocide Convention,
*  Israel must immediately halt its military offensive and any other action in the Rafah
*  Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could
*  bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.
*  The order came as part of South Africa's genocide case against Israel at the World
*  Court.
*  Though the order is legally binding, there is no enforcement mechanism.
*  We'll go to the International Court of Justice after headlines.
*  European heads of state are facing ever-louder calls to join Spain, Norway and Ireland in
*  recognizing Palestinian statehood after Sunday's attack on Rafah.
*  Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez spoke earlier today ahead of Spain's official
*  recognition process in a Cabinet meeting.
*  The state of Palestine must be viable, with the West Bank and Gaza connected by a corridor
*  and with East Jerusalem as its capital, and must be unified under the legitimate government
*  of the Palestine National Authority.
*  Although it is not up to Spain to define the borders of other countries, our position is
*  aligned with the UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 and with the position of the European
*  Union.
*  Therefore, we won't recognize change in the 1967 lines other than those agreed to
*  by the parties.
*  Ireland and Norway also formalized their recognition of a Palestinian state today.
*  People took to the streets in cities around the world following Sunday's attack on Rafah,
*  including in Paris.
*  We don't want to be complicit in a crime against humanity.
*  What's happening in Rafah?
*  What's happening in the Gaza Strip is intolerable.
*  Protests are also continuing on college campuses.
*  At Brown University, President Christina Paxson's commencement speech was interrupted by demonstrators
*  from the group Brown Alumni for Palestine.
*  At the University of Chicago, four seniors are being denied their graduation after they
*  participated in Gaza Solidarity protests.
*  In Los Angeles, UCLA police have made their first arrest in connection with the violent
*  attack on pro-Palestinian student protesters last month.
*  18-year-old Edanan is accused of beating protesters with a wooden pole.

*  today over violations of their right to free speech.
*  In Canada, the largest university, the University of Toronto, on Monday asked a court to authorize
*  police action to arrest students who defied a deadline to dismantle their encampment.
*  Hundreds of tents have been put up during the weeks-long peaceful protest at the University
*  of Toronto as students demand their school divest from Israel.
*  Reporters Without Borders has lodged another complaint with the International Criminal
*  Court for, quote, war crimes against journalists in Gaza, unquote, where Israel's killed over
*  a hundred media workers since October 7th.
*  Reporters Without Borders said, quote, those who kill journalists are attacking the public's
*  right to information, which is even more essential in times of conflict.
*  They must be held accountable, unquote.
*  In Ukraine, at least 18 people, including a 12-year-old child, were killed after a Russian
*  strike on a shopping center in Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, Saturday.
*  Dozens of others were injured.
*  It's the deadliest Russian attack in weeks, as Kyiv warns Moscow is preparing to further
*  intensify its offensive along Ukraine's northeastern border.
*  In Papua New Guinea, officials say as many as 2,000 people are feared dead after they
*  were buried alive when a landslide engulfed several villages in the northern Enga province.
*  Thousands of residents have been ordered to evacuate as the landslide is still active.
*  Most of the bodies remain missing as rescue efforts have been hampered by unstable terrain
*  and a blocked off road.
*  I have 18 of my family members buried under the debris and soil that I'm standing on,
*  and a lot more family members in the village.
*  I cannot count.
*  I'm the landowner here.
*  I thank you to all those who have come to help us, but I cannot retrieve the bodies,
*  so I'm standing here helplessly.
*  At least 23 people were killed while millions of others were left without electricity after
*  Cyclone Ramal ripped through Bangladesh and eastern India Sunday, damaging homes, uprooting
*  trees and destroying power lines.
*  This comes amidst a protracted heat wave across Pakistan and western India.
*  In Pakistan's southern province of Sindh, temperatures have risen to over 125 degrees
*  Fahrenheit.
*  In India, voters face scorching temperatures as the country's six-week election, the
*  largest in the world, is nearing a close at the end of this week.
*  It feels like we will die if we step out of our house in this scorching heat, but we have
*  to vote for our nation, so that is why I have come here to vote.
*  In Brazil, officials are warning of the dangerous spread of waterborne disease following catastrophic
*  floods in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
*  At least 169 people have been killed in the floods, while many others are still missing,
*  and hundreds of thousands have been displaced.
*  Mexico is now experiencing its third heat wave of the year.
*  Temperatures as high as 113 degrees Fahrenheit are forecast for today across at least two
*  thirds of Mexico.
*  This comes as water has emerged as a key issue in next Sunday's elections.
*  Mexico's city residents have been forced to ration water for months due to a worsening
*  drought that could leave as many as 22 million people without access to water.
*  Officials warn reserves could run dry as soon as late June.
*  Back in the United States, at least 22 people were killed as catastrophic storms and tornadoes
*  swept across Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky over the weekend.
*  Meanwhile, over 400,000 people were left without electricity across the eastern U.S. Monday
*  due to severe weather.
*  South Korea, China and Japan have issued a joint declaration after their first trilateral
*  summit in four years.
*  The three nations met in Seoul in South Korea amidst rising tensions between Beijing and
*  Washington over trade, Taiwan and regional influence.
*  This is Chinese Premier Li Chang.
*  We will deepen economic trade connectivity, strengthen cooperation in regional industrial
*  and supply chains and promote the resumption of negotiations on the China-Japan-South Korea
*  free trade agreement.
*  Ahead of the summit in Seoul, activists gathered to protest Japan's military cooperation
*  with South Korea and its refusal to provide reparations for its sex trafficking of girls
*  and women from countries under its occupation in the Second World War.
*  This is a survivor of Japan's wartime sexual slavery, or so-called comfort woman, 95-year-old
*  Li Yong-soo.
*  I want to urge Japan to enforce the compensation and resolve the historical issue.
*  And while we are protecting our past, the young should know this history while they
*  visit each other's countries.
*  At the United Nations Geneva headquarters, negotiators from around the world failed to
*  agree on a treaty that would outline a global strategy to handle the next major pandemic.
*  The treaty, which had been in the works for over two years, aimed to establish binding
*  policies for World Health Organization member nations, which includes the United States,
*  and enabling equitable access to vaccines and treatments, among other issues.
*  Here in New York, closing arguments are being delivered today in Donald Trump's criminal
*  hush money and election interference trial.
*  Trump's facing 34 felony counts for falsifying business records to cover up payments made
*  to Stormy Daniels in order to protect his 2016 presidential campaign prospects.
*  The jury is expected to begin deliberating on Wednesday.
*  In Georgia, an immigrant from Liberia has died while detained at the notorious Immigration
*  and Customs Enforcement Stewart Detention Center.
*  Forty-four-year-old Convert Dennis had been jailed at Stewart since last year.
*  Dennis is believed to be at least the 12th death at Stewart, which is run by the private
*  company CoreCivic.
*  In Texas, families of the victims of the Valdez massacre filed lawsuits against Meta and Microsoft
*  and the gunmaker Daniel Defense.
*  The 18-year-old mass shooter used a Daniel Defense rifle when he entered Robb Elementary
*  School May 24, 2022, and murdered 19 children and two teachers.
*  The families say the Meta-owned Instagram and the Microsoft-owned Activision, which
*  makes the video game Call of Duty, are guilty of marketing the assault-style rifles to teenage
*  boys who play the game, like the Uvalde shooter.
*  The lawsuit argues, quote,
*  "...these companies are chewing up alienated teenage boys and spitting out mass shooters,"
*  unquote.
*  And the United Auto Workers has filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board and
*  requested a new vote for workers at a pair of Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama.
*  Around 5,000 workers voted against unionizing with the UAW earlier this month after an intense
*  union-busting campaign by Mercedes-Benz, which the union accused of wanton lawlessness.
*  UAW says the company forced workers to sit through anti-union meetings and retaliated
*  against pro-union workers, including through termination.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
