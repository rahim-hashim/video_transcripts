Brazilian filmmaker Petra Costa's latest documentary, _Apocalypse in the Tropics_, explores the impact of evangelical Christianity on Brazil's political landscape. Once a small minority, evangelicals now constitute about 30% of Brazil's population and played a key role in the rise of former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. "It's one of the fastest-growing religious shifts in the history of mankind," Costa tells _Democracy Now!_ She says right-wing evangelicalism in Brazil is largely a U.S. import, after Washington sought to undermine the influence of left-wing Catholic teachings during the Cold War. 
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to impose 50% tariffs on Brazil, partly as retribution for what he calls the "witch hunt" against Bolsonaro, now facing trial in Brazil for an alleged coup attempt following his defeat in the 2022 presidential election to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. "Apocalypse in the Tropics" is available on Netflix starting July 14. Costa's previous film, "The Edge of Democracy," was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

*  This is the trailer for Apocalypse in the Tropics. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=87.6s)]
*  We've added English voices over where needed for our radio listeners. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=90.8s)]

*  population. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=136.0s)]
*  A rapid religious shift molded into an unprecedented political force. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=137.0s)]
*  What really influences my vote is my religion. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=143.8s)]
*  We are the absolute majority in this country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=150.8s)]
*  What made socialism fail was denying religion. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=158.8s)]
*  With truth, we're building a new politics in Brazil. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=164.8s)]
*  Bolsonaro likes talking to me because I'm frank. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=167.8s)]
*  God above everything, God above everyone. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=173.8s)]
*  That's democracy. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=175.8s)]
*  But democracy isn't just the will of the majority. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=177.8s)]
*  It's also protection of the minority. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=179.8s)]
*  Democracy is the absolute majority's will. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=181.8s)]
*  He's turning the church into a political pulpit. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=195.8s)]
*  Here, we'll destroy them. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=198.8s)]
*  Freedom of speech isn't freedom to attack. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=204.8s)]
*  Democracy isn't anarchy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=207.8s)]
*  What will happen to Brazilian democracy? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=211.8s)]
*  The Brazilian nation is living a new moment. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=215.8s)]
*  The trailer for Apocalypse in the Tropics. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=217.8s)]
*  For more, we're joined by its director, Petra Costa. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=235.8s)]
*  She is a Brazilian filmmaker and actress. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=239.8s)]
*  This film hits at a pivotal time as President Trump goes after Brazil [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=243.8s)]
*  every which way for hosting the BRICS Summit with Lula in the lead [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=248.8s)]
*  to this trial that's taking place. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=253.8s)]
*  Bolsonaro is also at the center of this film, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=256.8s)]
*  as well as the rise of evangelicals in Brazil. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=259.8s)]
*  A lot of remarkable parallels to the United States. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=262.8s)]
*  Bolsonaro is known as the Trump of the Tropics. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=266.8s)]
*  Can you talk about who Bolsonaro is, this tempted coup, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=269.8s)]
*  and where this whole religious backing comes from? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=275.8s)]
*  Yes, so Bolsonaro was a congressman when I made my film The Edge of Democracy, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=280.8s)]
*  which we spoke about here, Amy, a few years ago. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=285.8s)]
*  He was one of the most far-right congressmen who was defending the military dictatorship, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=288.8s)]
*  declared his vote against Dilma at the time, defending the torture of Dilma. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=295.8s)]
*  Dilma Rousseff, the first female president of Brazil. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=301.8s)]
*  Then he decided to run for president and did not have the working class vote in the beginning. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=305.8s)]
*  He gained that by declaring himself somewhat evangelical, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=312.8s)]
*  making an alliance with the pastor who's the protagonist of our film, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=317.8s)]
*  Mala Faya, Silas Mala Faya, a prominent televangelist. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=322.8s)]
*  And in this marriage between religion and politics, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=326.8s)]
*  Bolsonaro was very useful for a growing movement in Brazil [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=329.8s)]
*  that comes from the United States, which it's called Dominion Theology, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=335.8s)]
*  that has as a plan the takeover of the three branches of government. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=339.8s)]
*  The judiciary, the legislative, and the executive. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=344.8s)]
*  We had the chance of filming with Mala Faya, this pastor, during the last five years. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=347.8s)]
*  And during that time, what was fascinating to see was his power over the president only grew. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=352.8s)]
*  And Bolsonaro became a vessel, an instrument to executing this Dominion Theologist plan, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=359.8s)]
*  which is very similar to what is happening in the United States with Trump and his allies, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=367.8s)]
*  such as Matt Huckabee, Peter Hagsseth. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=373.8s)]
*  And Huckabee, very significant. He is now the U.S. ambassador to Israel. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=378.8s)]
*  And the last actions of Netanyahu in the United States yesterday, the Israeli prime minister, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=382.8s)]
*  were to meet with the evangelical Christians of the United States supporting him in Israel. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=388.8s)]
*  And in this film, we also trace the origin of this evangelical, apocalyptic, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=396.8s)]
*  and sometimes Zionist thought that believes that waging war in the Middle East [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=400.8s)]
*  will accelerate the second coming of Christ. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=406.8s)]
*  A fascinating theology that is really shaping our geopolitics at this moment [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=410.8s)]
*  and is very understudied for its relevance. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=416.8s)]
*  The film is an investigation into that, into how this apocalyptic theology [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=419.8s)]
*  is shaping Brazilian politics at this moment [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=424.8s)]
*  and really making our elections become less a discussion of programs, of plans for the future, but holy wars. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=427.8s)]
*  And Petra, you do in the film, I mean, you take also like a historical look. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=435.8s)]
*  It's not just about what's happened immediately. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=440.8s)]
*  You document, for example, the visit of the American evangelist Billy Graham, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=443.8s)]
*  who came to Brazil, I think, for the first time in 1960 and was met by massive audiences. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=451.8s)]
*  So if you could talk about that, what was the appeal he had then? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=457.8s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about 70 years ago, right? Over 60 years ago. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=461.8s)]
*  And how that movement built from then? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=465.8s)]
*  Well, Brazil is one of the greatest Catholic nations in the world. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=468.8s)]
*  And in the 60s and 70s, a movement called liberation theology was growing [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=474.8s)]
*  and had many thoughts about social justice, of empowering the poor and the oppressed in Brazil. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=480.8s)]
*  But that movement was encountered with much antipathy by the likes of Kissinger [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=488.8s)]
*  and also the lobbying group, the family, also known as the Fellowship in the United States, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=494.8s)]
*  which thought as part of the Cold War project, it was interesting to send evangelical missionaries to Brazil [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=499.8s)]
*  against the alleged communist threat. Billy Graham went to Brazil. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=506.8s)]
*  The dictatorship decided to show his cult, his rally or service in the Maracanã, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=512.8s)]
*  the biggest stadium in Brazil, in all channels at the time. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=520.8s)]
*  Evangelicalism grew. Since then, when I was born in the 80s, it was 5% of the population were evangelical. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=524.8s)]
*  Today, there's 26% of the population. It's one of the fastest growing religious shifts in the history of mankind. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=531.8s)]
*  And it's not problematic at all. And it's actually delivering social services and spiritual help [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=538.8s)]
*  and psychological help to many of Brazilians. And faith is something that we can't talk about. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=547.8s)]
*  And there's no reason to interfere or to discuss people's faith only when it decides to have a plan [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=554.8s)]
*  that will basically erode our democracy and one of the greatest achievements of modern society, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=561.8s)]
*  which is the separation of church and state. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt9Sl-43dcQ&t=568.8s)]
