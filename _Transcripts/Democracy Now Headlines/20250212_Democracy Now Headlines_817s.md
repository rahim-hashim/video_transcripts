*  We're going to have Gaza. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=97.64s)]
*  We don't have to buy it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=98.64s)]
*  There's nothing to buy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=99.64s)]
*  We will have Gaza. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=100.64s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=101.64s)]
*  There's no reason to buy it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=102.64s)]
*  There is nothing to buy it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=103.64s)]
*  It's Gaza. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=104.64s)]
*  It's a war-torn area. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=105.64s)]

*  steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=116.96s)]
*  This is the unified Arab position, the king wrote. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=121.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Egyptian president, Abdu'l-Fattah al-Sisi, has postponed a planned visit to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=125.72s)]
*  Washington, D.C., scheduled for next week, after Trump threatened to cut off aid to Jordan [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=130.0s)]
*  and Egypt unless the countries agreed to receive the Palestinians expelled from Gaza. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=135.2s)]
*  A senior Egyptian diplomat told the new Arab newspaper any cut in U.S. aid would threaten [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=141.36s)]
*  Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=146.32s)]
*  The family of Dr. Hassam Abu Safiyah, the director of Northern Gaza's Kamel Adwan Hospital, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=149.88s)]
*  confirmed he was finally granted a visit with his attorney nearly two months after he was [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=156.64s)]
*  abducted and detained by Israeli forces. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=161.66s)]
*  In a statement, the family described Dr. Abu Safiyah's accounts of severe abuse and torture by Israeli [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  soldiers, including 24 days of solitary confinement before his transfer to Ofer prison. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=170.56s)]
*  His family said he's only given one meal a day. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  Israel has not filed any charges against Dr. Abu Safiyah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=179.56s)]
*  In a statement, his family writes, quote, He urges the world to help secure his release [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=182.4s)]
*  and the release of all detained healthcare personnel from all hospitals. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=188.84s)]
*  They must be protected, their rights ensured, and they should receive care and be released [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=193.4s)]
*  as soon as possible, they said. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=197.82000000000002s)]
*  President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday ordering massive cuts to the U.S. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=201.70000000000002s)]
*  federal workforce, with a team lead from the Department of Government Efficiency assigned [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=205.02s)]
*  to each federal agency to oversee firings and new hires. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=210.08s)]
*  Trump's order gives even more power to Elon Musk and his Doge operation and what Democrats [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=214.10000000000002s)]
*  and legal scholars have condemned as an unconstitutional power grab by the world's richest man. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=218.74s)]
*  On Tuesday, Democratic lawmakers joined federal workers for a protest on Capitol Hill demanding [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=224.42s)]
*  congressional action. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=228.94s)]
*  This is Everett Kelly, president of the American Federation of Government Employees. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=230.7s)]
*  We are here today to send a message, a loud and clear message to our senators and our [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=234.33999999999997s)]
*  representatives here on Capitol Hill. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=246.17999999999998s)]
*  And the message is this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=249.34s)]
*  Save the civil service and save the country. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=251.22s)]
*  On Tuesday, Elon Musk and President Trump spoke to reporters from the Oval Office. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=256.86s)]
*  Elon Musk standing alongside President Trump, who remained seated at the Resolute Desk. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=262.7s)]
*  It was the first time Musk had taken questions about his Doge operation since Trump tasked [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=268.3s)]
*  him with slashing trillions of dollars in federal spending. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=272.54s)]
*  Musk repeatedly rejected reporters' assertions that Doge operates in deep secrecy. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=276.46s)]
*  So, all of our actions are maximally transparent. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=281.38s)]
*  In fact, I don't think there's beenâ€”I don't know of a case where an organization [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=284.82s)]
*  has been more transparent than the Doge organization. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=289.73999999999995s)]
*  The White House said Tuesday Musk is serving as an unpaid special government employee and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=293.17999999999995s)]
*  therefore his financial disclosure report is not required to be made public. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=297.5s)]
*  The White House has also worked to shield Musk's operation from open records laws, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=301.5s)]
*  including the Freedom of Information Act, by invoking the Presidential Records Act, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=306.34s)]
*  which would see Doge records kept secret, sealed, until 2034. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=310.09999999999997s)]
*  The New York Times reports there are more than 32 continuing investigations pending [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=316.18s)]
*  complaints or enforcement actions into Musk's six companies across at least 11 federal agencies [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=320.29999999999995s)]
*  that have been affected by the Trump administration's purge of civil servants. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=326.46s)]
*  Musk is also a major beneficiary of NASA and the Department of Defense funds. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=331.1s)]
*  With SpaceX reporting, it's received about $22 billion in government contracts. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=335.3s)]
*  On Tuesday, Musk repeatedly denied his vast business holdings presented a conflict of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=340.54s)]
*  interest. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=344.54s)]
*  If you have received billions of dollars in contracts from the Pentagon and the president's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=345.54s)]
*  directing you to look into the Department of Defense, is that a conflict of interest? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=351.38s)]
*  Yes, which we definitely need to do and are going to do, at the president's request. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=353.38s)]
*  Does that present a conflict of interest for you? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=356.58000000000004s)]
*  No, because you'd have to look at the individual contract and say, first of all, I'm not [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=359.06s)]
*  the one filing the contract. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=362.34s)]
*  It's people at SpaceX. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=365.34s)]
*  Musk spoke with his four-year-old son X, that's X-A-A-12, sitting on his shoulders, often [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=367.62s)]
*  putting his fingers in Elon Musk's ears. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=375.34s)]
*  The White House has fired Paul Martin, the inspector general for the U.S. Agency for [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=378.26s)]
*  International Development. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=382.34s)]
*  Martin's abrupt termination Tuesday came a day after his office warned in a scathing [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=384.09999999999997s)]
*  report that moves by Trump and Elon Musk to defund USAID has put nearly $500 million worth [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=388.09999999999997s)]
*  of food aid at risk of spoilage as it sits idle in ports, ships and warehouses. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=395.58s)]
*  Like Trump's purge of 17 other inspectors general last month, Martin's firing appeared [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=401.78s)]
*  to violate a law requiring the administration to alert Congress 30 days in advance. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=406.3s)]
*  A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the National Institutes of [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=414.3s)]
*  Health from implementing severe cuts to research funding imposed by the Trump administration. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=418.90000000000003s)]
*  This comes after 22 states, including Massachusetts, filed a lawsuit Monday arguing the move would [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=424.54s)]
*  studies into treatments for cancer, Alzheimer's, heart disease and other chronic conditions. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=431.3s)]
*  The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee has accused Trump's pick to head the FBI, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=439.42s)]
*  Cash Patel, of committing perjury during his confirmation hearing. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=444.3s)]
*  When Patel testified, he didn't know about the Trump administration's purge of top [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=448.42s)]
*  officials at the FBI. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=453.02s)]
*  This is Senator Dick Durbin speaking during Senate debate on Tuesday. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=455.02s)]
*  According to my whistleblower sources, Mr. Patel is receiving information from within [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=460.3s)]
*  the FBI from the director's advisory team. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=466.3s)]
*  Mr. Patel then provides direction to Stephen Miller, who relays it to the acting deputy [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=469.98s)]
*  attorney general Bovet. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=475.1s)]
*  It is unacceptable for a nominee with no legal or current role in government to personally [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=476.90000000000003s)]
*  direct the unjustified and potentially illegal firings of dedicated nonpartisan professionals [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=483.66s)]
*  at the FBI. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=490.26s)]
*  If these allegations are true, then Mr. Patel may have committed perjury before the Senate [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=492.53999999999996s)]
*  Judiciary Committee. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=497.18s)]
*  The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a Thursday vote on whether to recommend Cash [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=500.06s)]
*  Patel's confirmation to the full Senate. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=504.9s)]
*  In Memphis, Tennessee, shocking new surveillance video shows four masked men in plain clothes [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=508.9s)]
*  hauling away restaurant workers in what city officials later confirm was a raid by immigration [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=513.58s)]
*  and customs enforcement. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=519.86s)]
*  Social media account for restaurant owner Taconganas, Memphis, posted the video online [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=522.62s)]
*  with the caption, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=528.54s)]
*  "'We don't know if the men you see in the video work for ICE or for someone else. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=529.54s)]
*  You'll see they have no uniforms, do not show any badge or ID, and did not leave any [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=533.66s)]
*  identifying information or paperwork. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL3c8yTGOnQ&t=538.66s)]
