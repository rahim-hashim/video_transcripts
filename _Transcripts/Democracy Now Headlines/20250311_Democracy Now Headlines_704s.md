In Syria, over a thousand people have been killed, the vast majority of them civilians, in a spate of massacres largely targeting the country's Alawite religious minority. Syria's longtime ruling family, the Assads, are members of the Alawite sect. The recent clashes began Thursday after coordinated attacks by gunmen linked to the former regime killed over 200 members of the new government's security forces. In response, government forces along with armed groups and individuals poured into Alawite villages throughout the region, carrying out reprisal attacks. Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has denounced the attacks and vowed to hold those responsible to account. Al-Sharaa is "trying to present a more acceptable image," after years of Syria's isolation from the global capitalist economy, says Syrian scholar Yasser Munif. "His priority is to end the sanctions against Syria and bring the funding for reconstruction. … He is managing all these tensions and contradictions, and it will be quite the challenge for him to succeed."

*  On Friday, reports began to emerge that scores of civilians, including children and the elderly, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=86.78s)]
*  were being targeted in reprisal attacks. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=92.5s)]

*  The Syrian Network of Human Rights found the vast majority of civilians were killed by [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=103.22s)]
*  armed groups previously affiliated with Turkish-backed factions fighting the Assad regime. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=108.38s)]
*  They're among the many disparate armed groups the new Syrian government's trying to integrate [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=114.7s)]
*  into its army. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  Syria's interim president, Ahmed Sharha, said on Monday the deadly violence is a threat [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=120.14s)]
*  to his mission to unite the country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=125.18s)]
*  In an interview with Reuters late Monday night, he vowed to punish those responsible for the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  mass killings. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  AL-SARHA, Syrian Prime Minister, Syria [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  Syria is, as we have confirmed, a state of law. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=137.06s)]
*  The law will take its course on all. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=140.3s)]
*  And we originally fought the regime and reached Damascus to defend the oppressed people. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  And we won't accept that any blood be shed unjustly or goes without punishment or accountability, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=146.98s)]

*  There is no difference in this matter. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=158.73999999999998s)]
*  Violating people's sanctity, violating their religion, violating their money, this is a [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=161.26s)]
*  red line in Syria. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=165.98s)]
*  This is not only a constitutional law, but it is also a moral law. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  Syria's interim president, Sharha, did not respond to questions about the responsibility [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=171.9s)]
*  of his own security forces or foreign fighters and other allied Islamist groups. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=175.94000000000003s)]
*  On Sunday, he announced the formation of an independent committee to probe the killings [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=180.94000000000003s)]
*  and bring those responsible to justice. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  For more, we go to Boston, where we're joined by Yasser Meenif, a Syrian scholar and sociology [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  professor at Emerson College who specializes in grassroots movements in Syria, the author [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=192.5s)]
*  of the Syrian Revolution, co-founder of the Global Prison Abolition Alliance. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=197.94s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us, Professor Meenif. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=204.1s)]
*  If you can start off by talking about who died in these massacres, the mass number of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=206.42s)]
*  people who were killed and who killed them. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=212.4s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's a devastating tragedy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  So my thoughts are with all who lost loved ones and relatives. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=222.34s)]
*  The reports, according to the reports, there are more than 1,000 people who were killed, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  more than 770 civilians and armed fighters, many of whom are Alawite and there are also [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=233.58s)]
*  Sunni. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=244.46s)]
*  The clashes started on Thursday night. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=247.26s)]
*  The Syrian security forces were ambushed by Assad's loyalists. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=250.22s)]
*  And the following day, the Syrian government mobilized the population in many cities, Sunni [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=255.34s)]
*  cities, and bussed them to the Alawite region, the coastal region. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=260.58s)]
*  And that provoked sectarian violence. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=266.46s)]
*  The security forces, who are, as you mentioned in your report, heterogeneous forces composed [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=271.90000000000003s)]
*  of the Turkish-backed militias, who are famous for their corruption and violence against [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  the Kurdish population in the north in the several five or six past years, were also [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=287.98s)]
*  sent to those regions. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=295.98s)]
*  And they are behind most of the killing of the civilian Alawite in that coastal region. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=297.22s)]
*  And Professor, could you give our audience a brief history of the Alawite community in [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=306.18s)]
*  Syria and its relationship to the rest of the society? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=313.06s)]
*  So the Alawite are a small Shia minority, around 10 percent of the population, 2.3 million [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=319.70000000000005s)]
*  people. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=327.22s)]
*  And the Assad regime family comes from the Alawite sect. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=328.22s)]
*  And it instrumentalized the sect to control and to govern Syria in the past 50 years. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=333.22s)]
*  So the Syrian government used a double discourse. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  On the one hand, it claimed to be secular and socialist and didn't really care about [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=341.18s)]
*  religion. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=347.62s)]
*  But also, at the same time, it presented itself as the savior of minority, as the only way [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=348.62s)]
*  to control the Sunni majority population and scared the minority, especially the Alawite. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=356.44s)]
*  It also prevented the Alawite, for the most part, to have any kind of economic independence, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=365.4s)]
*  meaning that they mostly lived in and marginalized economically and politically before the rise [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=371.64s)]
*  of the Assad family. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  And it made sure that many of them joined the army, security forces and also the public [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=378.96s)]
*  sector. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=384.96s)]
*  This dependency to the regime made it very hard for them to be opposed to the regime [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=386.12s)]
*  during the war, the Syrian revolution, in the past 14 years. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=393.08s)]
*  So there are many opponents of the Syrian regime that come from the Alawite sect, but [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=398.44s)]
*  oftentimes they are severely and harshly repressed, put in prison, killed, assassinated. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=405.12s)]
*  And there is also a large fragment or section of that population that is silent and neutral. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=412.35999999999996s)]
*  And there is a minority that supported the regime very loudly. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=419.52s)]
*  But they were not the only one. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=422.91999999999996s)]
*  There were many Sunni and many other sects that supported the Syrian regime. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=425.52s)]
*  And because of that, the Sunni majority have developed, as a reaction, a sectarian sentiment [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=430.32s)]
*  against that population. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=437.4s)]
*  And it perceived what happened on Thursday as a way to take revenge of the massacre [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=440.36s)]
*  that happened in the past 14 years. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=445.28s)]
*  And could you talk about the significance of the deal signed this week between the new [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=450.32s)]
*  Syrian government and the Kurdish-led and U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, especially [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=457.12s)]
*  since that area of Syria is so rich in oil? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=464.68s)]
*  Yeah, so the Syrian regime is facing many, many challenges, political and economic. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=471.32s)]
*  So after the fall of the regime, Israel attacked the Syrian army and destroyed more than 90 [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=477.84s)]
*  percent of that army. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=484.4s)]
*  And it has been trying to govern Syria and create a platform for political participation, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=486.68s)]
*  but at the same time was unable to get the support of many of the minority. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=494.88s)]
*  The Kurds in the south and—sorry, the Kurds in the north and the Druze in the south, and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=499.68s)]
*  obviously the Alawites in the coastal areas. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  So this is a hopeful moment for many Syrians. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=509.84s)]
*  Many Syrians were celebrating yesterday because the Kurds have been marginalized historically [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=514.6s)]
*  in Syria and have been oppressed for many, many decades under the Assad rule. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=520.96s)]
*  But because they were not completely supporting the Syrian revolution, many in the opposition [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=526.92s)]
*  and now the new government did not necessarily feel that they were—they should take part [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=532.32s)]
*  in the political process. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=539.8s)]
*  And so, this is really excellent news. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=542.0s)]
*  I hope that they are able to build a better future with the Kurdish population and give [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=544.64s)]
*  political and economic rights that they deserve because of their historical marginalization [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=552.4s)]
*  for many, many decades. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  Finally, Professor Mounir, the interim president has tried to show the international community [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=560.12s)]
*  that he's not sectarian, but these massacres have spread fear in the minority communities [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=567.5600000000001s)]
*  in Syria. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=574.1600000000001s)]
*  Can you talk about what kind of hope there is for the country coming together after 14 [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=575.88s)]
*  years of war? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=584.4s)]
*  So, the interim president, Ahmad Al-Shar'a, has a long history. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=586.64s)]
*  He is pragmatic, too. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=593.88s)]
*  He came from ISIS first and then al-Qaeda, and then he joined the national forces that [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=595.9599999999999s)]
*  were fighting against the Syrian regime since 2017. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=603.48s)]
*  And after the fall of the Syrian regime, he is trying to present a more acceptable image, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=607.56s)]
*  because his priority is to end the sanctions against Syria and bring funding for reconstruction. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=615.28s)]
*  There is need for at least $250 billion to reconstruct Syria. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefoUEcVkPc&t=622.0s)]
