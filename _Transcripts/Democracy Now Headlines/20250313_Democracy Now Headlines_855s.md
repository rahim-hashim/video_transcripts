A new report by United Nations experts says Israel has carried out "genocidal acts" against Palestinians in Gaza, including the destruction of women's healthcare facilities, intended to prevent births, and the use of sexual violence as a strategy of war. This comes as talks on resuscitating the ceasefire deal continue in Qatar and as Israel continues its total blockade of food, fuel, medicine and other humanitarian aid into the Palestinian territory. For more, we speak with two American doctors volunteering at Nasser Medical Complex in Gaza. "It's a very difficult situation, and the attacks on the healthcare system that were done in the past 16 months have really undermined its ability to help people," says trauma surgeon Dr. Feroze Sidhwa. We also speak with Dr. Mark Perlmutter, an orthopedic and hand surgeon, who says about 350 Palestinian medical workers who remain in Israeli prisons without charge must be freed. Many who have been released describe horrific abuse. "The physical and mental torture â€¦ presents a tremendous weight on the healthcare system here," says Dr. Perlmutter.

*  For more on the attack on Gaza's fragile healthcare system and as Israel's total [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=117.28s)]

*  in, we go now to Gaza, where we're joined by two volunteer doctors. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=127.64s)]
*  Dr. Feroz Sidwa is a trauma surgeon volunteering at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Yunis, Gaza, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=132.68s)]
*  with MedGlobal. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=139.44s)]
*  He is usually based in California. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=140.72s)]
*  And Dr. Mark Perlmutter is an orthopedic's hand surgery specialist volunteering also [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=143.08s)]
*  at Nasser Medical Complex with the charity Humanity Auxilium. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=148.2s)]
*  Last year, they both volunteered at the European Hospital in Khan Yunis during Israel's active [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  assault on Gaza. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=157.52s)]
*  We welcome you both to Democracy Now! [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=159.28s)]
*  Dr. Feroz Sidwa, let's begin with you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=161.32s)]
*  breaking news of the U.N. report calling Israel guilty of genocidal acts, particularly targeting [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=164.72s)]
*  maternity hospitals, the IVF clinic and overall the healthcare system in Gaza. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=173.48s)]
*  If you can respond to, coming back to Gaza now, how you found the hospital and your response [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=180.18s)]
*  to what they have found. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=186.5s)]
*  Yes, the hospital in Gaza is, we're at Nasser Medical Complex on the western side of Khan [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=190.28s)]
*  Yunis. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=198.0s)]
*  And it's certainly better than when we were at European Hospital last year. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=199.24s)]
*  The whole hospital isn't full of refugees and displaced people. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=204.04s)]
*  So there's some, the hospital can actually function. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=208.72s)]
*  But this hospital was actually attacked in February and March of last year. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=212.12s)]
*  The dialysis ward was destroyed. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=217.0s)]
*  A lot of equipment for new operating rooms was destroyed. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=224.48s)]
*  And right now, the blockade is really affecting the availability of instruments and disposables [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=229.0s)]
*  in the operating room. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=235.4s)]
*  And it's making life very difficult for people here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=237.64s)]
*  Beyond the healthcare system, the prices and the market are going up again. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=240.6s)]
*  The availability of certain types of food is going down. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  Meat and other proteins are very hard to come by now. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=247.48s)]
*  Eggs are about a dollar a piece in the market just outside the hospital that I saw yesterday. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  So it's a very difficult situation. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=253.84s)]
*  And the attacks on the healthcare system that were done in the past 16 months have really [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=257.48s)]
*  undermined its ability to help people. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=261.84s)]
*  And can you talk about the Israeli energy minister just cutting off electricity to Gaza? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  It hasn't been an obvious problem in the hospital because we have a generator. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=273.04s)]
*  But the electricity is now clicking on and off, I don't know, three times a day, four [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=284.12s)]
*  times a day, whereas before it was not doing that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  So yeah, no, it's cutting off electricity to a whole population captive in an open air [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  prison is going to happen. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=304.04s)]
*  It looks like we just lost the video to Gaza, to Khan Yunis. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=305.04s)]
*  It's remarkable that we're even able to make that connection. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  We just reconnected with Gazaâ€”we'll see how long we can keep them onâ€”to return to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=315.88s)]
*  our conversation with two American doctors who are volunteering at hospitals in Khan [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=321.04s)]
*  Yunis. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=326.16s)]
*  This is now the 12th day since Israel has completely blockaded the strip, cutting off [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=327.24s)]
*  all food, medicine and fuel, Dr. Feroz Sidwa and Dr. Mark Palmiter. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=331.52s)]
*  Welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=336.52s)]
*  Dr. Palmiter, we last spoke to you in North Carolina, after you had returned from Gaza. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=338.12s)]
*  You are back. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=343.12s)]
*  Can you talk about what's happening, and particularly about the medical staff, the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=344.12s)]
*  doctors, the nurses, the staff, those, for example, who have been arrested by Israel, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=349.28s)]
*  even one, I understand, who you've talked to, who was recently released? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=354.88s)]
*  I have a colleague, an orthopedic surgeon that specializes in pediatric orthopedics, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=359.52s)]
*  who was abducted from the hospital, from the operating room, in February of 2024. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=369.64s)]
*  He was just released. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  When he was arrested, he was strip-searched, marched naked in front of his colleagues, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=377.2s)]
*  beaten on a daily basis in an Israeli prison, beaten more intensely when he asked to speak [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=383.24s)]
*  to a lawyer, and even more intensely after he spoke to his lawyer. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=389.1s)]
*  He had his fingers broken in his hand. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=395.38s)]
*  He had handcuffs on, guards step on the handcuffs to torque them into the nerves of his hand, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=397.3s)]
*  ruining the nerves in his operative hands. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=402.94s)]
*  If the physical daily beatings and the loss of his hand function wasn't enough, the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=406.18s)]
*  psychological torture, which is their specialty, according to almost everybody who's been released, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=411.66s)]
*  there's still approximately 350 health care workers in Israeli prisons, all without charges. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=418.84s)]
*  The psychological torture is immense. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=427.76s)]
*  They showed him photographs, surveillance photographs of his wife, and said, we will [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=430.36s)]
*  bring her here and gang rape her in front of you if you don't admit that you're Hamas, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=435.12s)]
*  which is what their request was when they were breaking individual finger bones. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  And then they showed him a GPS photo of his house and said that they would send a drone [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=445.46s)]
*  through his bedroom window, killing his wife and kids if he did admit that he was Hamas. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=450.34s)]
*  So the physical and mental torture, which is supported by many health care workers that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=456.53999999999996s)]
*  were released and is still obviously going on in Israeli prisons, presents a tremendous [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=460.85999999999996s)]
*  weight on the health care system here. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=468.21999999999997s)]
*  Dr. Mark Pahlmutter, you are Jewish-American. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=470.65999999999997s)]
*  You are urging him, this orthopedic surgeon, to sue American-Israeli, you know, American [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=476.58s)]
*  IDF soldiers in a civil suit, making them personally, financially responsible for what [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=484.74s)]
*  has taken place. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=492.98s)]
*  Again, you are also currently president of the World Surgical Foundation, immediate past [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=494.26s)]
*  president of the International College of Surgeons. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=498.96s)]
*  Civil lawsuit? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=502.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's something that's developing now. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, we've all been to D.C. and spoke to our feckless senators and congressmen. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=510.35999999999996s)]
*  We find themâ€”I personally find them to be spineless and, along with our past two presidents, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=518.8199999999999s)]
*  directly responsible for the carnage that we've witnessed here. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=524.84s)]
*  I think soon that American 2,000-pound bombs will be dropping here again when the ceasefire [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=528.76s)]
*  ends and Israel has ruined every ceasefire that has ever been declared in their history [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=534.96s)]
*  with Palestine. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=542.46s)]
*  And I think that when that carnage restarts, decades from now, history will remember, especially [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=545.8s)]
*  our past two presidents in our current spineless senate and congress, as the murderers that [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=553.88s)]
*  they truly are, by not having the guts to stand up to Israel. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=561.56s)]
*  And it's not an anti-Jewish stance, it's an anti-Zionism stance that they need to take. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=567.92s)]
*  And every time somebody protests in favor of a Palestinian, just like this story that [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=573.72s)]
*  you just broadcast, it's interpreted as an anti-Semitic stance and not an anti-Zionism [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=581.96s)]
*  stance. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=589.0400000000001s)]
*  And the two are completely different. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=590.0400000000001s)]
*  In fact, Zionism is the major cause for the destruction of Judaism. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=592.6800000000001s)]
*  Dr. Sidhuah, you're meeting with the U.N. Secretary General and demanding to know or [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=599.0s)]
*  for information on where Dr. Abu Safiyah is, the head of the Kamal Adwan Pediatric Hospital. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=605.68s)]
*  Yes, Dr. Abu Safiyah was taken after Kamal Adwan had been laid siege to for 80 or 90 [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=613.68s)]
*  days. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=625.16s)]
*  The entire hospital has been completely destroyed at this point. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=626.16s)]
*  And yeah, he's a pediatrician, nothing special about him. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=629.1999999999999s)]
*  He was actually taken by the Israelis earlier in the war and let go precisely because he's [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=633.28s)]
*  not a threat to anybody. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=637.8s)]
*  But then they decided to arrest him again, decided to torment him as well, just like [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=639.6s)]
*  they have with so many others. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=642.8s)]
*  But yes, we were able to meet with Antonio Gutierrez, the Secretary General of the U.N., [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=645.04s)]
*  as well as Tom Fletcher, the Undersecretary General for OCHA. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=649.56s)]
*  And Secretary General Gutierrez was very interested in the case. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=653.4s)]
*  He asked Mr. Fletcher to look into it, which he did. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=656.88s)]
*  Mr. Fletcher raised the issue with the Israelis, met with Dr. Abu Safiyah's family, quite publicly [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=661.5999999999999s)]
*  actually, and still no word on Dr. Abu Safiyah's release date. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=668.5999999999999s)]
*  The Israelis keep pushing back his court dates and things like that. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=674.3599999999999s)]
*  But we're very much hoping that he'll be released soon. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=677.0s)]
*  This territory needs every doctor, every nurse that it can possibly muster. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=681.28s)]
*  It's true that the bombs have stopped falling and most of the shooting has stopped. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=687.68s)]
*  The Israelis are still killing about half a dozen people a day. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=690.88s)]
*  But the bombing has, thank God, stopped for the most part. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=694.32s)]
*  But everyone here is still homeless. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=700.0400000000001s)]
*  Everyone here is still hungry. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=702.2800000000001s)]
*  Everyone here is still thirsty. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=703.76s)]
*  And as you mentioned at the beginning of the hour, the Israelis have cut off all entry [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=704.96s)]
*  and exit to Gaza again. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=709.76s)]
*  This is, you've got 1.8, 1.9, 2 million people locked in a cage, and they can't access anything [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=711.8000000000001s)]
*  from the outside world. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=720.48s)]
*  They can't survive like this. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=721.76s)]
*  People are turning on each other here. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=723.72s)]
*  Palestinian society is very communal and very, there's a lot of solidarity in it, but there's [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=725.36s)]
*  limits to everything. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=730.08s)]
*  Just last night, we actually had a mass shooting between two different families over what, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=731.8000000000001s)]
*  who knows, but people are just at their breaking point with the necessities of life just being [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=736.76s)]
*  unavailable, not for a week or a month or a year, but for 16 months now. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=742.2s)]
*  It has to end. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=747.56s)]
*  And what the United States is doing about this is just shameful. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=748.56s)]
*  It's backing Israel all the way. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=751.52s)]
*  It's got to stop. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=753.28s)]
*  It's got to stop. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=754.3599999999999s)]
*  And the complete cutting off of aid now into Gaza, which has been condemned by humanitarian [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=755.3599999999999s)]
*  groups around the world, Dr. Sidhuah? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=762.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, like, I'm here with MedGlobal. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=767.4799999999999s)]
*  It's a group that brings doctors in. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=776.64s)]
*  But even though I was able to get in, half of my own group was denied entry. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=777.64s)]
*  So only two out of the five doctors that were scheduled to come are here now. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=782.12s)]
*  Dr. Perlmutter, your hand surgery colleague was also denied entry. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=787.04s)]
*  What is being allowed in and not being allowed in? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  Who is being allowed in and not allowed in? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=796.1999999999999s)]
*  It just seems to be completely random and arbitrary. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=798.24s)]
*  And it's wreaking havoc on the whole society. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=801.72s)]
*  I mean, again, the wholeâ€”people can't survive with nothing. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=803.64s)]
*  That's not how human life works. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=807.48s)]
*  And the United States needs to stop backing this insane isolation of two million people, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=810.24s)]
*  half of whom are children, most of whom are refugees. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=817.64s)]
*  They didn't do anything to anybody. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=819.96s)]
*  Just stop treating them this way. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=821.88s)]
*  I want to thank you both for being with us, Dr. Feroz Sidhuah and Dr. Mark Perlmutter, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=823.72s)]
*  both U.S.-based surgeons back in Gaza to volunteer. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=830.04s)]
*  They're currently volunteering at the Nasr Medical Complex in Hanunas. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYquC5PxM&t=835.1999999999999s)]
