*  Survivors said they lost everything in the fire.
*  At 1, 10 a.m., we woke up in shock to find fire rising here.
*  What can I say?
*  I quickly ran with my daughters.
*  I woke them up and quickly rushed to Al-Aqsa Hospital.
*  What can I say?

*  My tent has collapsed, destroyed.
*  All our clothes and belongings are gone.
*  Who should we speak to?
*  Where is the safety?
*  We are calling on all countries, the whole world, to stand by our side and stop the war
*  on us.
*  We are exhausted.

*  in the Nusadat refugee camp.
*  At least 22 people were killed in the attack.
*  The U.N. reports it had planned to use the site, the Mufti School, to give out polio
*  vaccinations today.
*  On Saturday, another Israeli airstrike in the Nusadat refugee camp killed a family of
*  eight, a mother, father and their six children, with the youngest being just eight years old.
*  On Friday, Israeli strikes on the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza killed at least
*  20 people and injured dozens.
*  Israel's intensifying attacks on northern Gaza comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*  Netanyahu is considering implementing a surrender or starve policy in the area.

*  to an end.
*  Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Makati also decried the attacks on the U.N.

*  threatened by targeting the United Nations security forces.
*  Later in the broadcast, we'll speak with Palestinian journalist Rami Khoury.
*  Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is urging the European Union to suspend its free trade
*  agreement with Israel.

*  I believe that the European Commission, the government of all Europeans, must respond
*  once and for all to the formal request that two European countries made, Spain and Ireland,
*  nine months ago, and suspend the free trade agreement with the government of Israel.
*  And the international community must immediately suspend the shipment of weapons to Israel,
*  as Spain has done, for a very simple but also overwhelming reason, that without weapons
*  there is no war.
*  Later in the broadcast, we'll speak with Israeli journalist Maroun Rakhpapour.
*  In campaign news, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called on Sunday for the National
*  Guard, or U.S. military, to be deployed on U.S. soil to target what he called radical

*  Trump made the call during an interview on Fox News.
*  I think the bigger problem are the people from within.
*  We have some very bad people.
*  We have some sick people, radical left lunatics.

*  The Chinese war games are occurring as Russia's defense minister is making an official visit
*  to Beijing.
*  In Spain, as many as 150,000 protesters marched in Madrid Sunday to demand affordable housing.
*  Protesters organized under the slogan, Housing is a Right, Not a Business.
*  Housing advocates have blamed the affordable housing shortage in Spain on short-term rental
*  companies including Airbnb and Booking.com.
*  We Spaniards cannot live in our cities.
*  We are being driven out of the cities, not just out of the center.

*  In 2012, Lilly Ledbetter spoke at the Democratic National Convention.
*  After nearly two decades of hard, proud work, I found out that I was making significantly
*  less money than the men who were doing the same work as me.
*  I went home, talked to my husband, and we decided to fight.
*  We decided to fight for our family and for your family, too.
*  We thought justice, because equal pay for equal work, is an American barrier.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
