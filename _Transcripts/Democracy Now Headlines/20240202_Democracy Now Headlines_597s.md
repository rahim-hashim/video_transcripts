**Democracy Now!:** [February 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgyalk7bBys)
*  AMY GOODMAN, The War and Peace Report, Democracy Now!
*  Over one million displaced Palestinians are under threat of a new ground assault on Gaza's
*  southernmost city of Ra'a, after the Israeli military said it would attack the area once
*  labeled a safe zone.
*  The U.N. called Ra'a located on the border with Egypt a quote, pressure cooker of despair.
*  The death toll in Gaza continues to rise, with over 27,000 people killed and more than
*  66,000 wounded in four months.
*  Over 11,000 of those killed by Israel have been children.
*  The Palestine Red Crescent Society is calling for the international community to intervene
*  immediately to halt attacks on medical workers and to help find a 6-year-old girl, Hind,
*  and two members of their emergency medical team, Yusef Zaino and Ahmed Ahmadoun, who
*  have been missing for nearly four days.
*  Hind and her 15-year-old relative, Leanne Hamadeh, called the Red Crescent Monday, pleading
*  for help as Israeli tanks approached their family's car in Gaza City.
*  All six members of Hind's family were killed by Israeli fire, including Leanne.
*  These were her last words recorded on the call with the Red Crescent dispatcher.
*  After all her family members were killed, 6-year-old Hind remained trapped in the car
*  as emergency workers tried to reach her.
*  This is Rana Al-Faqih, the emergency dispatcher, who spent several hours on the phone with
*  Hind trying to reassure and calm the little girl.
*  It is a painful experience when you hear her voice, which was trembling, sad, and at the
*  same time she had hope that someone would save her.
*  But we were helpless.
*  We felt that we were paralyzed, because we were thinking about the situation she was
*  in.
*  She was trapped inside a car with six bodies of martyrs, audio of tanks and aircraft firing.
*  When the tank came close to her, she was screaming and crying.
*  The worst minute was when she said the tank got closer, and then the phone cut.
*  At this moment, I thought the tank climbed on the car.
*  At this moment, I started to cry, and I was trying to be strong.
*  President Biden signed an executive order Thursday imposing new sanctions on Israeli
*  settlers involved in violent attacks on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
*  At least eight Palestinians, including one child, have been killed and over 100 injured
*  in some 500-settler attacks since October 7th.
*  The executive order for now targets just four settlers, but could be used against others
*  in the future, including Israeli politicians.
*  Biden officials reportedly considered adding the ultra-nationalist cabinet ministers Itamar
*  Ben-Ghavir and Bezalal Smotrich to the list, but decided against it.
*  The Pentagon has approved a series of strikes against targets inside Iraq and Syria in response
*  to the recent attack on a U.S. military base in northern Jordan that killed three U.S.
*  soldiers and other attacks in the region.
*  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the U.S. is working to avoid a wider Middle East conflict
*  and is not seeking war with Iran.
*  Our teammates were killed by radical militias backed by Iran and operating inside Syria
*  and Iraq.
*  In the aftermath of the vile Hamas terrorist assault on Israel on October 7th, terrorist
*  groups backed by Iran and funded by Iran have tried to create even more turmoil, including
*  the Houthis attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
*  How much Iran knew or didn't know, we don't know, but it really doesn't matter because
*  Iran sponsors these groups, it funds these groups.
*  Secretary Austin also apologized for the secrecy, what he called privacy, surrounding his recent
*  hospitalization and prostate cancer diagnosis.
*  Activists shut down at least half a dozen major roads in Washington, D.C. during Thursday
*  morning rush hour and marched through the streets to demand an end to U.S. military
*  support for Israel.
*  Police arrested roughly two dozen protesters.
*  Four criminals in the building behind us need to stop funding genocide and funding our communities.
*  We don't have health care, we don't have public education, people are dying on the
*  streets while our government is sending $3.8 billion to genocide and kill doctors and students
*  and teachers and babies in the hospitals.
*  There's a genocide going right now that our government is funding.
*  In Canada, activists blockaded all access points for the port of Vancouver, calling
*  on the government to enact an arms embargo on Israel following the International Court
*  of Justice ruling last week that there is a plausible risk Israel is committing genocide
*  in Gaza.
*  Meanwhile, over 800 officials across the United States, the U.K. and European Union released
*  a joint letter of dissent today saying, quote, our government's current policies weaken
*  their moral standing and undermine their ability to stand up for freedom, justice and
*  human rights globally.
*  Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis is deploying state and national guard troops
*  to the Texas-Mexico border in a move that's been widely condemned by immigration rights
*  groups.
*  DeSantis made the announcement Thursday as he stood on a podium displaying the words
*  Stop the Invasion.
*  DeSantis is one of many Republican leaders who's pledged support for Texas Republican
*  Governor Greg Abbott's intensifying anti-immigrant hate speech and policies.
*  Meanwhile, Abbott continues to defy a Supreme Court order that allowed the Biden administration
*  to cut down razor wire put up by Texas troopers along its border with Mexico.
*  European Union leaders have approved a new 50 billion euro funding package to Ukraine
*  overcoming weeks of resistance from Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

*  border enforcement deal next week following heated negotiations.
*  In Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky is reportedly set to dismiss his top general, Valery Zeluzhny.
*  Tensions between the two have been rising following Ukraine's failed counteroffensive
*  last year and after Zeluzhny described the war with Russia as a stalemate.
*  In related news, the International Court of Justice has found Russia violated portions
*  of two treaties, one on financing terrorism, another on eradicating racial discrimination.
*  The ruling came as part of Ukraine's case accusing Moscow of funding separatist groups
*  in eastern Ukraine and discriminating against Crimea's multi-ethnic community since its
*  annexation a decade ago.
*  The court, however, declined to rule on Ukraine's request for Russia to pay reparations for attacks
*  in eastern Ukraine blamed on pro-separatist Ukrainian rebels.
*  In the U.K., the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg appeared in a London court
*  Thursday as her trial got underway for protesting outside the entrance of a major oil and gas
*  industry conference last October.
*  Greta spoke outside the courthouse alongside two co-defendants.
*  Even though we are the ones standing here and climate, environmental and human rights
*  activists all over the world are being prosecuted, sometimes convicted and given legal penalties
*  For acting in line with science, we must remember who the real enemy is.
*  What are we defending?
*  Who are our laws meant to protect?
*  Back in the United States, the Republican-dominated Georgia State Senate passed a bill which would
*  criminalize the majority of bail funds.
*  SB 63 would make bailing more than three people out of jail per year illegal, including for
*  nonprofits and churches that run bail funds.
*  It also adds to the list of non-bail eligible offenses.
*  This comes as three activists with the Atlanta Solidarity Fund are facing racketeering and

*  It could also affect major national programs that operate in Georgia, such as Black Momma's
*  bailout action.
*  In New York, a federal judge sentenced former CIA software engineer Joshua Schulte to 40

*  into Apple and Android cell phones.
*  In addition to espionage and computer hacking, Schulte was also convicted for possessing
*  child pornography.
*  And the World Health Organization expects global cancer cases to rise by 77 percent
*  over the next 30 years.
*  The study predicts cancer-related deaths will roughly double from current levels to reach
*  around 20 million fatalities a year by 2050.
*  The WHO says tobacco, alcohol, air pollution and population aging and growth are some of
*  the key factors behind the rising numbers.
*  Lower-income countries will be disproportionately affected.
*  Currently, one out of every 12 patients in wealthier countries are diagnosed with breast
*  cancer and one in 71 will die from the disease.

*  And those are some of the headlines.
