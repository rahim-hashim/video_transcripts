**Democracy Now Headlines:** [September 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEv9jUrepc)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The U.N.'s warning more than a million people in central and southern Gaza received no food
*  rations in August, adding to a beyond catastrophic situation in the war-torn Palestinian enclave.
*  Gaza's health ministry, meanwhile, says Israel is hindering the delivery of polio
*  vaccines as its military refuses to coordinate the entry of medical teams in southern Gaza.
*  This all comes amidst ongoing Israeli aerial and ground attacks.
*  Deathwars were reported in Gaza City and the Nusadat refugee camp earlier today.
*  In Qayyunas, mourners grieve their murdered loved ones at Nasser Hospital, including this
*  mother whose son was killed by an Israeli strike.
*  A cry of pain comes from the depths of my heart.
*  I want the whole world to hear it.
*  The sound of my pain burns like fire from within.
*  My heart is heavy, full of pain.
*  As mass protests in Israel continue to demand a ceasefire and hostage release deal, Hamas
*  has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of continuing to block a deal as
*  he refuses to withdraw Israeli forces from Gaza's border with Egypt.
*  The U.S. Justice Department earlier this week indicted Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and five
*  others with terrorism and other charges over the October 7th attack in Israel.
*  Israeli forces are continuing their deadly raids in the occupied West Bank, including
*  Annabla, Spalata, Bethlehem, Hebron and Ramallah.
*  In Jenin and Tokarim, Israeli troops withdrew after a 10-day raid which killed a reported
*  36 people and left a trail of destruction.
*  This is Wasfiya Rahima from the Tokarim refugee camp.
*  This was the worst night.
*  Everyone left their homes, but I did not, because I am disabled.
*  My nephews told me they are going to leave, and I told them I will not go anywhere, whatever
*  God's willing will happen.
*  There were sounds of strikes here and behind the house.
*  They raised everything.
*  Look at it, the shooting and sound grenades.
*  I was reading the Koran all night so that God will protect us.
*  Seventy-eight years, I have never witnessed anything like this, from 1948 to 67 to all
*  the intifadas and all that I have witnessed, but nothing was like this.
*  Earlier today, Israel's National Security Minister, Tamar Ben-Gavir, called on Prime
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to include the defeat of Hamas and other groups in the occupied
*  West Bank as part of Israel's war objectives.
*  Ben-Gavir has repeatedly called for Israel to annex the West Bank.
*  In Georgia, authorities arrested the father of the 14-year-old suspect, who is admitted
*  to killing two students and two teachers at Apalachee High School in the city of Winder
*  on Wednesday.
*  He is charged with the following, four counts of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of
*  second-degree murder and eight counts of cruelty to children.
*  Mr. Gray, these charges stem from Mr. Gray knowingly allowing his son, Colt, to possess
*  a weapon.
*  Earlier in the day, President Biden called for parents of underage shooters to be held
*  responsible for gun deaths and reiterated his call on Congress to ban assault weapons
*  and tighten gun control laws.
*  The Georgia shooter's father had reportedly purchased the AR-15-style rifle used in the
*  massacre as a Christmas present for his 14-year-old son last year, months after the teenager was
*  questioned by authorities over online shooting threats.
*  Meanwhile in Chicago, authorities have charged a suspect with first-degree murder over the
*  shooting death of four passengers on Chicago's L-Train Monday.
*  Three of the victims were sleeping when they were killed.
*  Kamala Harris is calling for a 28 percent capital gains tax rate for Americans who earn
*  over $1 million a year.
*  While it's an increase on the current capital gains tax of 20 percent, Harris' proposal
*  is more than 10 percent less than the nearly 40 percent capital gains tax rate President
*  Biden has proposed.
*  The Democratic nominee unveiled her plans while on a campaign stop in New Hampshire.
*  Harris also announced plans for a $50,000 tax benefit for new small businesses, a ten-fold
*  increase on the current deduction of $5,000 for startup expenses.
*  The Justice Department has accused Moscow of backing a sweeping election interference
*  scheme.
*  On Wednesday, Attorney General Merrick Garland said his agency had seized 32 domains and
*  indicted two Russian nationals for carrying out a $10 million online misinformation campaign
*  to influence U.S. voters, he said.
*  The Justice Department says the state-owned Russia Today or RT television network bankrolled
*  the influence campaign.
*  CNN reports the funds were used to operate Tenant Media, which has published 2,000 videos
*  across YouTube and other social media sites since it launched late last year.
*  Tenant Six far-right Trump-supporting commentators have millions of online followers.
*  Anger is mounting over the murder of the Ugandan Olympic marathon runner Rebecca Chepdegay,
*  who died Thursday in Kenya of organ failure, four days after her boyfriend doused her body
*  in gasoline and set her on fire.
*  Activists in Kenya are demanding authorities respond to the crisis of gender-based violence.
*  Recent data shows 40 percent of married women in Kenya have experienced intimate partner
*  violence.
*  In 2021, the Kenyan Olympic runner Agnes Tirolp was stabbed to death by her partner, whose
*  murder case is still ongoing.
*  This is Milka Chimos Chewa, another professional runner and friend of Rebecca Chepdegay.
*  In
*  public health news, the Democratic Republic of Congo received its first delivery of M-Pax
*  vaccine doses on Thursday, as cases continue to surge.
*  The organization GAVI, a global vaccine alliance, said it hopes the virus can be contained with
*  the rapid distribution of vaccines in order to prevent another global crisis on the scale
*  of COVID-19.
*  M-Pax, in particular, is actually happening in conflict areas.
*  And access in conflict areas is not always guaranteed.
*  Children are actually taking the highest hit, because you have to look at the case fatality.
*  The case fatality for children is much higher.
*  So it goes without saying that children are actually then a high-priority group.
*  Nicaragua's government has freed 135 political and religious prisoners accused of supporting
*  anti-government protests following secret talks negotiated by the Biden administration.
*  The prisoners were flown to Guatemala, where they'll have an opportunity to apply for
*  U.S. residency.
*  Since 2018, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has ordered the arrest of hundreds of political
*  opponents, including many Catholic priests and bishops, while shutting down more than
*  5,000 civic organizations.
*  The Biden administration is pressing Honduras to reverse its decision to end its long-running
*  extradition treaty with the United States.
*  Pressure on President Xiomara Castro has mounted since last weekend, when her brother-in-law,
*  Carlos Zelaya, admitted to reporters he met in 2013 with a leader of a narco-trafficking
*  operation who offered to support Castro's failed bid for the presidency that year.
*  His admission came just days after the U.S. ambassador criticized Honduras' defense
*  minister for meeting with his Venezuelan counterpart, who was indicted by the U.S. on drug trafficking
*  charges in 2020.
*  Last week, Honduran President Castro accused the U.S. and opposition groups of plotting
*  like the U.S.-backed ouster of her husband, then-President Manuel Zelaya, in 2009.
*  I want to tell you a plan against my government is being hatched.
*  The people must know it.
*  To see our coverage of that coup, go to democracynow.org.
*  Authorities in Haiti have expanded a state of emergency to the entire nation amidst worsening
*  gang violence.
*  On Wednesday, Acting Prime Minister Gary Keneal said he distributed weapons to the Haitian
*  Army and the national police in order to retake territory controlled by gangs.
*  The order came a day before U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's arrival in Haiti.
*  On Thursday, Blinken met with Keneal, where he praised the Kenyan-led international security
*  mission in Haiti and urged Haitian officials to prepare for Haiti's first national election
*  since 2016.
*  Many Haitians have opposed the U.S.-backed mission, as past international interventions
*  have contributed to political destabilization and humanitarian crises in Haiti.
*  Blinken is in the country to manage his interests and the interests of the United States, because
*  the weapons with which the gangs operate come from the United States.
*  He's not going to do anything for us.
*  His visit is a joke.
*  Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges Thursday, just hours before jury
*  selection was set to begin in his trial.
*  Though the surprise plea means he'll avoid a lengthy trial, Hunter Biden still faces
*  up to 17 years in prison and fines of up to $1.3 million for crimes including tax evasion,
*  filing fraudulent tax returns and failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes from 2016 to
*  2019.
*  Hunter Biden will be sentenced on December 16th by a Trump-appointed judge.
*  Separately, Hunter Biden faces sentencing in November for convictions on three felony
*  gun charges in Delaware.
*  President Biden has repeatedly vowed not to pardon his son or commute possible prison
*  sentences.
*  Here in New York, federal agents have raided the homes of at least four top officials with
*  the administration of Mayor Eric Adams.
*  On Wednesday, agents reportedly seized phones and other devices from First Deputy Mayor
*  Sheena Wright, Deputy Mayor for Criminal Justice Philip Banks III, NYPD Commissioner Edward
*  Caban and Timothy Pearson, a former high-ranking police official and top adviser to Adams.
*  It's unclear why the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York ordered the
*  So far, Mayor Adams has not been charged with a crime.
*  Last November, federal agents seized phones and a laptop from Adams' home and raided
*  the home of his campaign treasurer as part of an investigation into whether the campaign
*  received illegal donations from Turkey.
*  Mayor Adams is a former police officer.
*  In other news from New York, 50 activists were arrested Thursday at the final action
*  of the Summer of Heat series of protests at the Citibank headquarters.
*  Faith leaders, scientists, climate and peace activists gathered again in a joint protest
*  to demand Citibank stop funding fossil fuel projects and an end to the war on Gaza.
*  This is Maureen Stubblefield of the Climate Reality Leadership Corps speaking to the NYPD
*  as she was being arrested.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
