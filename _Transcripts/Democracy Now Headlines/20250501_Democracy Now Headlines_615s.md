Columbia University student and Palestinian activist Mohsen Mahdawi has been released on bail by a Vermont judge after more than two weeks in U.S. immigration custody. "I am saying it clear and loud to President Trump and his Cabinet: I am not afraid of you," he told supporters as he left a Vermont courthouse. Despite being a legal permanent resident, Mahdawi was arrested by immigration enforcement last month at what he was told would be a citizenship interview, and accused by the State Department of posing a threat to national security over his pro-Palestine campus activism. We get an update from Shezza Abboushi Dallal, part of Mahdawi's legal team, who says his release was facilitated by the prior blocking of his transfer to a jurisdiction more favorable to the Trump administration. Mahdawi will now be able to attend his graduation from Columbia University this month.

**Democracy Now Headlines:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ)
*  We begin today's show in Vermont, where Columbia University student and Palestinian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=0.0s)]
*  activist Mohsen Mahdavi was released after more than two weeks in U.S. immigration custody. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=4.34s)]
*  Mahdavi is a green cardholder from Palestine who was born and raised in a refugee camp [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=10.18s)]
*  in the occupied West Bank. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=14.52s)]
*  He was arrested on April 14th when he appeared for what he was told would be a citizenship [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=16.7s)]
*  interview. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=21.42s)]
*  Mahdavi had participated in the Palestinian solidarity protests at Columbia last year. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=22.42s)]
*  He was also president of the Columbia University Buddhist Association. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=27.54s)]
*  He was freed on bail on Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Crawford, who criticized [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=31.98s)]
*  the Trump administration's handling of the case. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=37.06s)]
*  In his ruling, Crawford wrote that Mahdavi had made, quote, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=39.8s)]
*  "...substantial claims that his detention is the result of a retaliation for a protected [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=43.42s)]
*  speech that he engaged in as a college student on the Columbia campus." [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  Crawford went on to write, quote, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=53.9s)]
*  The court also considers the extraordinary setting of this case and others like it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=55.9s)]
*  Legal residents not charged with crimes or misconduct are being arrested and threatened [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=61.22s)]
*  with deportation for stating their views on the political issues of the day. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=66.38s)]
*  Our nation has seen times like this before, especially during the Red Scare and Palmer [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=70.86s)]
*  Raids of 1990-1920, that led to the deportation of hundreds of people suspected of anarchist [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=75.42s)]
*  or communist views, Crawford wrote. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=82.62s)]
*  After Mohsen Mahdavi left the federal courthouse in Burlington, Vermont, he addressed supporters. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=86.30000000000001s)]
*  And we send a clear message as well, that if we have faith in our beliefs, unshakable [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=93.42s)]
*  beliefs, which is the belief that justice is inevitable, we will not fear anyone because [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=102.58000000000001s)]
*  our fight is a fight for love, is a fight for democracy, is a fight for humanity. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=110.52s)]
*  And I am saying it clear and loud. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=121.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=126.92s)]
*  To President Trump and his cabinet, I am not afraid of you. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=128.28s)]
*  Never give up on the idea that justice will prevail and that we have to come together [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=140.44s)]
*  to bring our voices and our hearts and raise them not only for America, not only for this [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=152.44s)]
*  system of democracy that has checks and balances and this court is part of it, but also for [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=161.24s)]
*  our humanity. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=168.2s)]
*  We have to restore and reform the international order and abide by international law as a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=169.28s)]
*  first step towards justice. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=175.68s)]
*  We must stand up for humanity because the rest of the world, not only Palestine, is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=184.24s)]
*  watching us and what is going to happen in America is going to affect the rest of the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=189.12s)]
*  world. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=194.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=195.22s)]
*  I will end up by saying to my people in Palestine, I feel your pain, I see you suffering, and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=196.68s)]
*  I see the freedom, and it is very, very soon. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=208.28s)]
*  Free, free Palestine. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  Columbia University student and Palestinian activist Mohsen Madhawi, speaking in Burlington, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=215.56s)]
*  Vermont, Wednesday, after he was freed after over two weeks in an immigration jail. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  We're joined now by a member of his legal team, Shaza Abushi Dalal. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=229.72s)]
*  She's a staff attorney with the CLEAR Project at CUNY School of Law. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=234.6s)]
*  Shaza, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  I know you've just returned from Vermont, where you were with Mohsen. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  Can you talk about the significance of what the judge ruled and what are the conditions [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=245.4s)]
*  of Mohsen's release? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=252.52s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Amy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=255.96s)]
*  I can't overstate the significance of this ruling and the fact that Mohsen walked free [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=258.68s)]
*  yesterday and wakes up today in his home in Vermont, not in an ICE detention facility, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=264.28s)]
*  being punished for speaking out for Palestinian lives and freedom and against the genocide [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=270.52s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=276.52s)]
*  The judge yesterday ruled, ordered him released on bail. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=277.48s)]
*  And this is, you know, release on his own recognizance. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=285.08s)]
*  So he will be able to return to his home in Vermont, continue his studies at Columbia [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=289.88s)]
*  University, complete his undergraduate degree and continue on to a master's program in the fall, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=295.0s)]
*  and continue his advocacy for Palestinian life and dignity and freedom. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=302.92s)]
*  And that's of paramount importance to him. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=308.6s)]
*  And it was of paramount importance to the judge, too. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=311.88s)]
*  The judge acknowledged that, you know, this is on a backdrop of a chapter of U.S. history [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=315.48s)]
*  that is repressive and evocative of moments before, where the government attempts to wield, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  you know, the immigration system, detention, to punish people for their First Amendment [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=330.52s)]
*  protected speech, for their political advocacy. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=339.08s)]
*  And the judge situated his decision on that backdrop, in that context. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=342.68s)]
*  So, Shazia, as you said, he can come back to New York, he can return to his studies [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=350.35999999999996s)]
*  at Columbia, begin his master's degree next year. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  Next year, are there any other restrictions on his movement? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  In other words, he can come from Vermont to New York, but can he go anywhere else? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=362.44s)]
*  And what is the remaining immigration case against him? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=366.44s)]
*  So he's released pending the culmination of his federal litigation, so his habeas [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=371.56s)]
*  litigation in federal court in Vermont. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  And so the conditions reflect that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=382.12s)]
*  He, you know, his court case is in Vermont, so he needs to stay around, close to the court, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=385.08s)]
*  close to the court's jurisdiction, in order to see that process through. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=392.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's what that's going to look like. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=397.48s)]
*  And the Trump administration initially did want to move him, as well, Mohsen, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=401.4s)]
*  to the same Louisiana immigration jail that Mahmoud Khalil, two other students, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=407.88s)]
*  Ramesa Ozturk, are held in. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=413.96s)]
*  How come he was not sent to Louisiana, but to Vermont instead? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=416.28s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=421.0s)]
*  The administration was playing the same card and attempting to do the same exact thing that they [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=424.12s)]
*  did with Mahmoud Khalil, Ramesa Ozturk, Badr Kansuri. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=430.52s)]
*  They took him, abducted him at his naturalization interview in the final moments after he had [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=436.28s)]
*  signed saying that he would take an oath to the Constitution. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=444.2s)]
*  Masked men entered the room and abducted him. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=449.88s)]
*  And then they attempted to swiftly take him to the airport in order to commence a route [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=453.0s)]
*  towards Louisiana. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=457.64s)]
*  And the only thing that stopped him is Mohsen's legal team's intervention. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=459.79999999999995s)]
*  They filed the habeas petition before they had the opportunity to put him on a flight. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=466.44s)]
*  And in fact, they took him all the way to the airport and missed a flight out from [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=472.44s)]
*  Burlington, Vermont, at the very last moment. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=478.2s)]
*  So we had the benefit of having learned what the Trump administration's playbook is on all [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=481.72s)]
*  of these cases to whisk people, abduct them, take them away from their communities into fora that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=490.52000000000004s)]
*  are favorable for the government, and then present a series of delay tactics in their federal court [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=496.28000000000003s)]
*  proceedings on the basis of the fact that they are now in another state like Louisiana. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=505.08000000000004s)]
*  And so ultimately, Mohsen was able to remain in his home state of Vermont, surrounded by his [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=511.72s)]
*  community. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=517.96s)]
*  And anybody who's seen footage or had the fortune of being at court or in front of court yesterday [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=518.6s)]
*  in the district of Vermont was able to see the power of that community and how people showed up [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=525.08s)]
*  in outrage at what is happening to Mohsen and all the other people like Mahmoud and [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=533.08s)]
*  Rumeisa and Bader Khan-Souri, who do not have the benefit of being in their home state and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=542.04s)]
*  are still waiting to have their motions for release heard by the respective federal courts [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=548.68s)]
*  that they are in. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=556.04s)]
*  And so, in the case of Rumeisa, the Fulbright Scholar from Tufts, the international graduate [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=557.0799999999999s)]
*  student, a federal judge has ruled her case must be heard in Vermont, but she is still in Louisiana [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=562.04s)]
*  being held there because she was moved there. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=569.56s)]
*  So, Mohsen gets to come to New York for graduation at Columbia University? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=573.7199999999999s)]
*  Yes, he does. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=580.8399999999999s)]
*  I want to thank you very much for being with us. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=583.24s)]
*  Sheza Abushid-Dallal, staff attorney with The CLEAR Project, a CUNY school of law, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=586.8399999999999s)]
*  and a member of Mohsen Madhawi's legal defense team. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=592.68s)]
*  She's just back from Vermont here in New York, as she was with him yesterday as he was released. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLLbXJmoYQ&t=596.52s)]
