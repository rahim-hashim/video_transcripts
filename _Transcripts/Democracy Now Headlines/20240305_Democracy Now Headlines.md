*  The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled Monday states do not have the authority to remove
*  Donald Trump from the ballot under the Insurrection Clause of the 14th Amendment, which was written
*  to prevent Civil War Confederates from returning to government.
*  The court's ruling came after the state of Colorado attempted to take Trump off the
*  primary ballot over his actions inciting the January 6th insurrection.
*  In the majority opinion, justices wrote, quote,
*  States have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal
*  offices, especially the presidency.
*  The court's three liberal justices issued a concurring opinion warning the majority
*  ruling, quote, attempts to insulate all alleged insurrectionists from future challenges to
*  their holding federal office.
*  Colorado Secretary of State Jenna Griswold responded to the court's ruling on MSNBC.
*  My larger reaction is disappointment.
*  I do believe that states should be able, under our Constitution, to bar oath-breaking insurrectionists.
*  Millions of voters are heading to the polls today, as 15 states are holding primaries
*  and caucuses in what's known as Super Tuesday.
*  In California, there's a four-way race to fill the seat of the late Senator Dianne Feinstein.
*  Three Democratic Congress members, Adam Schiff, Katie Porter and Barbara Lee, are on the ballot

*  The top two candidates, regardless of party, will face off in November.
*  In Minnesota, some Democratic activists are urging voters to select uncommitted on the
*  to protest Joe Biden's support for Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  Jelani Hussain is co-chair of the Abandoned Biden campaign.
*  For Tuesday, it's not Minnesota Muslims, it's not the Muslims in the United States,
*  it's really the overwhelming majority of Democrats who believe that the president is
*  on a very dark course.
*  So many children have been killed in Gaza, over 30,000 dead.
*  Every single day, the Israeli Defense Force is killing innocent people, and our president
*  has stayed silent, has not done anything.
*  In fact, we have done the opposite.
*  We have stopped the world from calling and stopping this war and calling for an immediate
*  ceasefire.
*  The World Health Organization is warning malnutrition in northern Gaza is, quote, particularly extreme
*  as talks continue over a possible six-week temporary ceasefire.
*  On Monday, Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour warned children in Gaza are increasingly
*  dying of starvation.
*  He raised the case of Yazan al-Khufarna, an emaciated 10-year-old Palestinian child who
*  died of severe malnutrition and insufficient health care.
*  Look at our children.

*  Look what agony they are enduring.
*  Dozen more children who died of malnutrition have been identified, and many more have died
*  and are dying in darkness and destitution.

*  We also found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that conflict-related sexual violence,
*  including rape and gang rape, occurred during the 7th of October attacks in at least three locations,
*  namely the Nova Music Festival site and its surroundings, Road 232 and Kibbutz Rim.
*  And in most of these incidents, victims were first subjected to rape and then killed, and
*  at least two incidents relate to the rape of women's corpses.
*  The U.N. expert, Pramila Patten, went on to say reports of rapes occurring at a fourth
*  location, Kibbutz Be'erie, were unfounded.
*  She said her team had also found, quote, clear and convincing information that some hostages
*  held in Gaza had also suffered sexual violence.
*  The U.N. experts did not conduct their own investigation, but instead wrote the report,
*  based in large part from conversations with Israeli institutions, including Zaha, an Israeli
*  search and rescue organization that's been accused of spreading false stories about atrocities
*  on October 7th.
*  The U.N. team said it did not meet with any survivors of the sexual violence from October
*  7th.

*  violence while in Israeli detention.

*  inhuman and degrading treatment of Palestinians, men and women in detention, also under the
*  administrative detention, including sexual violence in the forms of invasive body searches,
*  threats of rape and prolonged forced nudity.
*  Two weeks ago, a group of U.N. experts expressed alarm over the abuse of Palestinian women
*  and girls held by Israel.
*  In a statement, the experts said, quote, we are particularly distressed by reports that
*  women and girls in detention have also been subjected to multiple forms of sexual assault,
*  such as being stripped naked and searched by male Israeli army officers.
*  At least two female Palestinian detainees were reportedly raped, while others were reportedly
*  threatened with rape and sexual violence, unquote.

*  And in Connecticut, five anti-nuclear activists connected to the Catholic worker movement
*  Monday for blocking the gates of a General Dynamics plant in New London, where the Columbia
*  class nuclear submarines are being designed and constructed.
