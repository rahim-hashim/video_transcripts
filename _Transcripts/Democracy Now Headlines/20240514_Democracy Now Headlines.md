*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In Gaza, Israeli bombs came down on the Nusaydat refugee camp in central Gaza overnight, landing
*  on a house and an UNRWA school housing displaced people.
*  At least 14 people were killed, including children.
*  Survivors desperately searched through the rubble for signs of life.
*  This is madness.
*  They're targeting people, civilians.
*  They have nothing to do with the resistance or with anything.
*  They're children.
*  I swear to God, they're children.
*  She's the friend of my girl.
*  They play together every day.
*  This is a worker with the UN refugee agency, UNRWA, that was hit in Nusaydat.
*  It happened around 2 or 5 a.m. in a place sheltering displaced people.
*  They came to the school to be safe, and the school was hit without any warning.
*  One of the school's staff members was martyred, and it seems that there is no safe place in
*  the Gaza Strip.
*  There is no power nor strength, except with God.
*  This is enough.
*  It's enough.
*  We ask God for safety.
*  Elsewhere in the Gaza Strip, Israeli ground forces have surrounded evacuation zones and
*  shelters in Jabalia, as Israel escalates attacks in the northern region.
*  A new Human Rights Watch report finds Israeli forces have attacked humanitarian aid convoys
*  and buildings at least eight times since October 7th, despite being given their coordinates
*  and without warning.
*  This comes as UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Monday called for a full investigation
*  after a UN aid worker was killed and another injured when their clearly marked vehicle
*  was attacked in Raqqa as they traveled to the European hospital.
*  More than 190 UN staff had been killed in Gaza since October 7th.
*  Meanwhile, inside Raqqa's European hospital, over 20 U.S. medical volunteers are now reportedly
*  and unable to return home after Israel sealed off the Raqqa border crossing last week.
*  Like many Gazans, the U.S. medical workers are now facing dehydration and other deadly
*  health conditions.
*  The Intercept's Ryan Grimm questioned State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel over
*  the fate of the U.S. doctors.
*  What does it say about conditions more generally in Raqqa and in Khan Yunis if American doctors
*  recently are already suffering from dehydration and malnutrition?
*  So look, we have not been unambiguous about the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
*  It is a crisis.
*  No amount of humanitarian aid at this moment is enough.
*  The State Department spokesperson also criticized Israeli settlers, who were seen in a video
*  blocking a Jordanian aid convoy headed toward Gaza, throwing food into the road and setting
*  fire to vehicles at the Tarkomia checkpoint near Hebron in the occupied West Bank.
*  As the death toll in Gaza tops 35,000, Palestinians mourned Monday the killing of Hashem Gazeel,
*  a disability rights advocate who was known as Gaza's godfather of the deaf.
*  Hashem Gazeel was killed in an Israeli airstrike along with his wife.
*  They had nine children.
*  Seven of them were reportedly severely injured in the strike.
*  A U.S. Army officer working at the Defense Intelligence Agency, the DIA, has resigned
*  to protest what he called the United States' unqualified support for Israel's war on
*  Gaza.
*  Major Harrison Mann wrote in a post online that the U.S. has, quote, enabled and empowered
*  the killing and starvation of tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians.
*  He went on to write, quote,
*  As a descendant of European Jews, I was raised in a particularly unforgiving moral environment
*  when it came to the topic of bearing responsibility for ethnic cleansing.
*  The Israeli newspaper Haaretz is reporting at least 10 Israeli officers and soldiers
*  have died by suicide since October 7th.
*  The total number of suicides is likely even higher, since the list does not include soldiers
*  who died after they were discharged.
*  Michael Cohen took the stand Monday in Donald Trump's criminal election interference trial
*  that Trump, his former boss, instructed him to make a $130,000 hush money payment to Stormy
*  Daniels in order to protect his 2016 presidential run.
*  The arrangement, which was made between Cohen, Trump and then Trump Organization CFO Allen
*  Weisselberg, included a plan to reimburse Cohen for the payment, which involved falsifying
*  business documents by classifying them as legal expenses, falsely claiming they were
*  payments to Cohen for his services as Trump's, quote, personal lawyer.
*  Michael Cohen, Trump's former fixer, told the court Trump said, quote,
*  Women will hate me.
*  This is going to be a disaster for the campaign, unquote.
*  Cohen also said, quote,
*  He wasn't thinking about Melania.
*  This was all about the campaign, unquote.
*  According to Cohen, Trump also urged him to drag out negotiations with Daniels past the
*  November election, saying, quote,
*  If I win, it has no relevance because I'm president, and if I lose, I don't really
*  care, Trump said.
*  Democratic senators say it's highly likely they'll investigate the former president
*  following reports that Trump told oil executives he would enact environmental policy rollbacks
*  in exchange for $1 billion in campaign contributions.
*  Trump reportedly made the offer at a dinner at Mar-a-Lago last month.
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken's in Ukraine on a surprise visit in his first trip to Kyiv
*  since Congress approved $61 billion in additional military aid to Ukraine.
*  Blinken's trip comes days after Russia launched a new ground offensive targeting Ukraine's
*  Kharkiv region.
*  In Australia, former military lawyer and whistleblower David McBride was sentenced to over five years
*  in prison for sharing classified material about Australian war crimes in Afghanistan.
*  The sentencing comes seven years after ABC, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, published
*  the leaked information in a report called The Afghan Files.
*  In related news, a court in London is expected to rule next Monday on whether to accept U.S.
*  government assurances that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will receive First Amendment
*  protections if extradited to the U.S. and put on trial for espionage and that he won't
*  be executed if found guilty.
*  In Brazil, the death toll from ongoing flooding in Rio Grande do Sul has reached 147.
*  Over 100 people are missing, half a million others have been displaced.
*  Authorities warn more floods and landslides could be on their way as rain continues to
*  plague the southern state.
*  This is a resident in one of the stricken towns.
*  I'll be quite honest.
*  I think that in the future, Mussum will become a river.
*  This flood left a lot of soil, a lot of sand, took a lot of trees into the town.
*  We really have to think that this is going to be very difficult for us to live here.
*  Climate protesters disrupted the Italian Open on Monday.
*  Members of the group Last Generation poured white paint and threw confetti on the tennis
*  court during a match, while other activists cemented their feet to the stands.
*  The action comes as Italy is facing a major drought.
*  Back in the U.S., over 5,000 workers at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama are voting
*  this week on whether to join the United Auto Workers Union.
*  Workers say Mercedes has repeatedly engaged in union-busting, and Republican leaders,
*  including Governor Kay Ivey, have also tried to stymie their efforts.
*  The United UAW says it believes workers will prevail as it hopes to see its second major
*  victory in the South since Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga, Tennessee, voted overwhelmingly
*  last month to join the union.
*  Last night, workers of the Hyundai plant in Alabama joined Reverend William Barber's
*  Moral Monday Mass in Montgomery to push their own union campaign.
*  We give our all to the company, but we have no pension, no retiree, no healthcare.
*  This is just wrong, and we're going to try to make things right.
*  And in other labor news, unionized workers at the University of California have begun
*  voting to authorize a strike to protest the violent crackdown on Gaza encampments at UCLA
*  and other UC campuses.
*  The UAW said, quote, our members have been beaten, concussed, pepper sprayed both by
*  counter protesters and by police forces, unquote.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
