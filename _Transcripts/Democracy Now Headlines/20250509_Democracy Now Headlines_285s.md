Ahead of the Mother's Day holiday in the Untied States, we speak to Duha Latif, a mother of two children in Gaza, about life for mothers living under Israeli occupation and assault. Democracy Now! last spoke to Latif over a year ago, when she was attempting to evacuate Rafah with her family. She now resides in a tent in Khan Younis and struggles to feed her family as Israel's blockade has created widespread famine throughout the Gaza Strip. "We are not living. We are enduring," says Latif. Her children, 8-year-old Amir and 3-year-old Karim, are suffering the effects of hunger and malnutrition. "The loss they are living is more than just the absence of food â€” it's the absence of life as they knew it."

*  Now I'm a witness to the slow collapse of existence. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nZuMjvpUt4&t=76.38s)]
*  A year ago, I appeared on Democracy Now when I was still in our home in Ra'afaa city. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nZuMjvpUt4&t=81.42s)]

*  as you know it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nZuMjvpUt4&t=111.06s)]

*  It's a part of the landscape, a natural extension of a long siege and a world that has chosen [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nZuMjvpUt4&t=115.54s)]
*  to become used to seeing us suffer. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nZuMjvpUt4&t=122.86s)]

*  meal into a battle and every loaf of bread into a small victory. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nZuMjvpUt4&t=152.94s)]
*  People race each other for a handful of flour. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nZuMjvpUt4&t=158.38s)]
*  They stand in the long lines not to buy food, but to search for it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nZuMjvpUt4&t=161.66s)]
