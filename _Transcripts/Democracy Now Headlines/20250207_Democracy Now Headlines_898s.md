*  over the United States or Israel, unquote. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=43.58s)]
*  Trump's action coincided with Netanyahu's visit to Capitol Hill Thursday, where he met [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=46.379999999999995s)]

*  Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said he was caught off guard by Trump's proposal [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=54.980000000000004s)]
*  and was awaiting details, but nonetheless praised it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=59.78s)]
*  Look, there will be more details forthcoming on that, of course. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=63.42s)]
*  The initial announcement yesterday, I think, was greeted by surprise by many, but cheered [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=67.18s)]
*  by, I think, people all around the world. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=73.14s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=75.38s)]
*  Because that area is so dangerous, and he's taking bold, decisive action to try to ensure [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=76.38s)]

*  Well, of course, this decision was expected, but nevertheless, it really threatens to undermine [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=95.78s)]
*  international accountability for the worst crimes and deprive victims all across the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=104.94s)]
*  globe of justice. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=111.46s)]
*  This executive order puts the United States on the side of war criminals at the expense [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=116.22s)]
*  of victims of grave crimes seeking justice. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=124.1s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gifted Trump a golden pager during their meeting [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=130.45999999999998s)]
*  at the White House, referencing Israel's deadly booby trap attacks on Lebanon in September, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=137.18s)]
*  which killed dozens of people and injured thousands more when thousands of pagers blew [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=144.62s)]
*  up at the same time. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=152.74s)]
*  President Trump is doubling down on his proposal for the United States to seize Gaza, saying [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=155.86s)]
*  the besieged territory would be, quote, turned over to the U.S. by Israel after it concludes [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=160.14000000000001s)]
*  its war. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=166.5s)]
*  Trump made the remarks on Truth Social, writing, quote, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  The Palestinians would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=170.78s)]
*  with new and modern homes in the region. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=175.38000000000002s)]
*  They would actually have a chance to be happy, safe and free. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=177.66000000000003s)]
*  No soldiers by the U.S. would be needed, unquote, Trump wrote. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=181.02s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reported Pentagon officials have received no formal request [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=185.62s)]
*  to draft a plan for U.S. troop deployment to Gaza. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=191.02s)]
*  Meanwhile, even some Republicans have come out in opposition, including Senator Lindsey [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=194.22s)]
*  Graham, who said other Senate Republicans oppose sending U.S. troops to Gaza. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=199.26s)]
*  Residents of Gaza compared Trump's plan to the 1948 Nakba and the violent displacement [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=204.34s)]
*  of Palestinians from their land over the past decades. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=210.76s)]
*  I believe that this plan is destined to fail. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=214.5s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=220.82s)]
*  With the occupation of Palestine in 1948, this project has been proposed by occupiers [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=221.9s)]
*  and nations that support occupation regarding the issue of displacing the population of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=227.1s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, but failed due to the steadfastness of our people in the face of this decision. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=231.78s)]
*  Of course, the occupation will also fail in this war of extermination that began on October [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  7, 2023. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=242.85999999999999s)]

*  Asia Bureau. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  This comes after Trump earlier this week ordered nearly the entire USAID staff to be placed [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=278.78s)]
*  on administrative leave beginning today and ordered thousands of personnel working overseas [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=283.94s)]
*  to return to the U.S. USAID distributed nearly $44 billion in aid during fiscal year 2023, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=290.65999999999997s)]

*  Office of Management and Budget. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=312.53999999999996s)]
*  Vogt is an architect of Project 2025, a radical playbook to seize executive power and to radically [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=315.53999999999996s)]
*  reshape federal agencies. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=321.86s)]

*  protesters. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=335.9s)]
*  Vogt also said he would work to paint federal workers as villains and, quote, put them in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=336.9s)]

*  not moved by vicious news cycles, but they are driven instead by mission, a mission to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=365.5s)]
*  serve this country to the very best of their ability, under any president of any party. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=372.14s)]
*  And in just 17 days, this president has put all of their livelihoods on the line. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhaTX1AwcEI&t=380.42s)]
