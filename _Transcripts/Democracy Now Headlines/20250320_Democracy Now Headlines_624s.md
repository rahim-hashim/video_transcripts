A jury in North Dakota has ordered Greenpeace to pay more than $660 million in damages for defaming Energy Transfer Partners, the corporation behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. The Texas-based pipeline company accused Greenpeace of orchestrating criminal behavior by training and providing funds to the Indigenous-led protests at Standing Rock. Greenpeace and its supporters, including other nonprofits and advocacy groups, argued that the lawsuit is part of a conspicuous attempt by corporations to destroy the right to free speech. Longtime human rights and environmental lawyer Steven Donziger, who was part of the independent trial monitoring team observing the trial, says it was purposely held in a region of the country with deep ties to the fossil fuel industry. Donziger said most of the jurors in the case were connected to the industry and were "predisposed" to rule in favor of Energy Transfer despite the "false narratives" presented at the trial. Greenpeace plans to appeal the ruling.

# Criminalizing Dissent: Greenpeace Ordered to Pay $667M to Dakota Access Pipeline Firm over Protests
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0)
*  The environmental group Greenpeace is vowing to appeal after a jury in North Dakota ordered [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=0.0s)]
*  the organization to pay $667 million in damages for defaming energy transfer partners, the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=5.84s)]
*  corporation behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=14.52s)]
*  The Texas-based pipeline company accused Greenpeace of orchestrating criminal behavior by training [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=17.92s)]
*  and providing funds to the indigenous-led protest at Standing Rock nearly a decade ago. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=23.92s)]
*  Greenpeace said it played a minor role at the protest and warned the lawsuit was aimed [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=30.68s)]
*  at destroying the right to peaceful protest. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=34.64s)]
*  Greenpeace attorney Deepa Pabinaba spoke outside the North Dakota courthouse on Wednesday. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=38.72s)]
*  What we saw these last three weeks was Energy Transfer's blatant disregard for the voices [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=47.52s)]
*  of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=54.28s)]
*  And while they also tried to rewrite Greenpeace's story, what this trial showed was Greenpeace's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  unwavering commitment to nonviolence in every action that we take. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=64.56s)]
*  We should all be concerned about the attacks on our First Amendment and lawsuits like this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=70.54s)]
*  that really threaten our rights to peaceful protest and free speech. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  And Greenpeace is going to continue its fight to protect these fundamental rights for everyone. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=81.76s)]
*  The indigenous water protector Kandie Mossett White, who took part in the Standing Rock [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  protests, also spoke outside the courthouse in Mandan. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=92.28s)]
*  My name is Kandie Mossett White. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=96.6s)]
*  I was born and raised in North Dakota. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=99.92s)]
*  I'm originally from Newtown. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=102.4s)]
*  I live in Bismarck. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=104.04s)]
*  I'm Mandan, Hidatsa, and Rikara all along the lands down south. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=105.04s)]
*  That is our historic lands that were destroyed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  And this company got money for defamation, for Greenpeace or for other people allegedly [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=112.68s)]
*  saying that they destroyed sacred sites. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=118.64s)]
*  They did! [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=121.0s)]
*  I was there! [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=122.0s)]
*  They got the letter from the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer on Friday, September [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  2nd, and on September 3rd, their company moved all of their bulldozers up two weeks ahead [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=128.88s)]
*  of schedule and razed the entire area. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=134.48s)]
*  There was burial grounds out there, and they're calling that defamation. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=137.48s)]
*  It's true. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=142.68s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=143.68s)]
*  I just don't understand how they can get away with it other than North Dakota is a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=144.68s)]
*  huge fossil fuel state. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=150.72s)]
*  I know that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=152.28s)]
*  I'm from here, I was born and raised here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=153.28s)]
*  Community Transfer Partners' attorney Trey Cox praised the jury's decision and accused [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=156.68s)]
*  Greenpeace of running a propaganda machine. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  Greenpeace paid protesters and trained individuals to unlawfully disrupt the construction of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=165.36s)]
*  the Dakota Access pipeline. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=173.68s)]
*  Greenpeace maliciously misrepresented events within this community in an unrelenting attempt [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  to stop, by any means possible, the construction of a pipeline that had already obtained all [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=181.84s)]
*  of the necessary legal approvals. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=188.24s)]
*  These are the facts, not the fake news of the Greenpeace propaganda machine. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=192.44s)]
*  We're joined right now by Steve Donziger, who was part of the independent trial monitoring [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=197.8s)]
*  team that's been observing the Greenpeace trial in Dakota. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=203.76s)]
*  Steve Donziger has his own history of battling corporations. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=208.2s)]
*  He was targeted for prosecution by Chevron after he successfully sued the oil giant on [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  behalf of 30,000 Amazonian indigenous people in Ecuador, whose land was devastated by oil [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  spills. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  He ended up being disbarred and spending over 900 days under house arrest. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  Steve Donziger, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=230.56s)]
*  This time in studio. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=233.0s)]
*  Start off, you were just in Manda and you were just in North Dakota. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  Talk about the significance of this multi-hundred million dollar verdict against Greenpeace [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=238.92s)]
*  that could bankrupt them. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=245.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the first thingâ€”first of all, we were in court every day for three weeks. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=247.64s)]
*  We had eight or nine attorneys on this team. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=251.16s)]
*  We organized it because for months we've had concerns about this trial. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=255.04s)]
*  It was very clear that this was not going to be a trial, as that term is commonly understood. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=258.84s)]
*  I would really call it more a choreographed show. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=265.12s)]
*  In a county that 75% of the people voted for Donald Trump, Greenpeace did a survey of residents [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=268.54s)]
*  prior to trial. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=275.82s)]
*  97% said they could not judge this case fairly. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=277.26s)]
*  Of the jurors, most had ties to the fossil fuel industry. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=281.22s)]
*  In our opinion, it was impossible for Greenpeace to get a fair trial in this county. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  Why couldn't they get it moved? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=289.62s)]
*  Well, they tried repeatedly to get it moved and the judge wouldn't move it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=290.86s)]
*  So that raises really another issue, which is the court itself, the judge in this case, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=294.42s)]
*  just didn't seem to want to give Greenpeace anything. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=300.0s)]
*  He repeatedly ruled against Greenpeace. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=303.24s)]
*  The proceedings at the request of the company were held pretty much in secret. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=305.8s)]
*  Trials in North Dakota are generally live streamed. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  Court TV had broadcast trials, but he cut off the live stream for the public and the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=314.04s)]
*  media. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=318.52000000000004s)]
*  It was very hard to getâ€”the only way you could cover the trial was to actually be physically [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  in court in this very isolated courthouse. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  So there was an effort, I think, really to shroud the trial in secrecy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=325.47999999999996s)]
*  Thousands of documents were sealed. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=330.11999999999995s)]
*  So I don't think Greenpeace, just watching this as someone who's actually been through [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=332.56s)]
*  this, I don't think they stood a chance. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=336.64s)]
*  What's interesting is, and sort of the larger issue, as Deepa pointed out, is this really [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=339.0s)]
*  is an attack on the First Amendment. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=344.12s)]
*  I mean, Greenpeace really, in essence, was a stand-in, in my opinion, for the Standing [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=346.35999999999996s)]
*  Rock Sioux, for the climate movement, for the right to protest. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=351.04s)]
*  And I think this company, and it's really been driven largely by CEO Kelsey Warren, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=354.64s)]
*  who is a huge Trump supporter, is trying to use this as a vehicle really to intimidate [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=359.72s)]
*  the climate movement, intimidate the Standing Rock Sioux, and I think really chill people's [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=365.0s)]
*  First Amendment rights. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=372.0s)]
*  And as we know, in this environment right now in the United States, that's a serious, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=373.0s)]
*  serious issue. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=376.76s)]
*  So this trial has serious implications. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=377.88s)]
*  It goes way beyond the environmental movement. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=379.84s)]
*  It goes really to the right to protest. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=381.96s)]
*  It affects church groups or religious organizations, political organizations. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=384.08s)]
*  And I think people need to keep a close eye on it and really do what they can to protect [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=388.56s)]
*  Greenpeace. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=393.12s)]
*  How was a Texas-based company, Energy Transfer Partners, able to bring this case in North [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=394.12s)]
*  Dakota? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=400.28s)]
*  Well, the reason they brought it to North Dakota is because the protest took place in [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=401.28s)]
*  North Dakota. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  So this pipeline runs from North Dakota down to Illinois. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=406.59999999999997s)]
*  It's about 1,200 miles. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=409.08s)]
*  And there were protests all along the way, but the most intense protest took place just [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=411.2s)]
*  south of, you know, Morton County or in Morton County, where the trial was held. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=415.68s)]
*  And they brought it there for the obvious reason to me that they felt like it was the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=421.28s)]
*  most hospitable venue they could find. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=425.91999999999996s)]
*  And you know, again, it really was not a trial, as is commonly understood. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=428.44s)]
*  Like they felt like they could get people on that jury who were completely sympathetic [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=433.28s)]
*  to the fossil fuel industry. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=439.15999999999997s)]
*  So explain what a SLAP lawsuit is. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=440.64s)]
*  And as you talk about this being much more significant than this particular case. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  So a SLAP lawsuit, and that's what I believe this is, is a lawsuit that's brought by a [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=448.44s)]
*  corporation or the government to silence people, someone who is speaking out, someone who's [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=453.12s)]
*  taking on the abuse of the corporation. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=458.2s)]
*  And it's really designed not to resolve a legitimate legal claim. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=461.52s)]
*  It's designed to really harass and impose extremely burdensome litigation on someone [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  who cannot afford it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=470.28000000000003s)]
*  So they shut up and stop talking. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=471.42s)]
*  And I think this is a classic SLAP lawsuit. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=473.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, the difference is Greenpeace has resources to defend it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=476.08s)]
*  And I thought their lawyers did a very, very good job under almost impossible circumstances. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=479.52000000000004s)]
*  But it really is not a legitimate lawsuit. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=486.04s)]
*  It's a lawsuit that violates the First Amendment to the Constitution because it's designed [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  to silence people's legitimate, constitutionally protected right to speak out. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=493.16s)]
*  And that's what happened to me too with Chevron. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=498.16s)]
*  And what's interesting for me personally, Amy, is that the same law firm that Chevron [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=499.88000000000005s)]
*  deployed against me that led to almost three years of detention and a criminal contempt [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=504.16s)]
*  of court case where I never got a jury because of my work on behalf of the Ecuadorian communities, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=509.24s)]
*  that same law firm, Gibson Dun & Crutcher, was hired by Energy Transfer to go after Greenpeace [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=515.24s)]
*  with the same legal theories. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=520.0s)]
*  And as we sat in court, I mean, it just felt like the false narrative all over again. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, basically, up was down, down was up. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=527.96s)]
*  And the judge sort of made evidentiary decisions that let the company really put in a false [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=530.6s)]
*  narrative that, for example, the protesters were violent. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=536.32s)]
*  When everybody who was down there knows, it was the law enforcement agencies and the private [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=539.76s)]
*  security companies hired by Energy Transfer that were really committing violence against [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=544.24s)]
*  the protesters. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=548.84s)]
*  There was a lot of false narrative in the courtroom, and the jury being, I think, predisposed [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=550.0400000000001s)]
*  to believe the company, they bought it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=555.2800000000001s)]
*  Could this shudder Greenpeace? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=558.2s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=560.5600000000001s)]
*  I think this is an important point. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=561.5600000000001s)]
*  We need to take a deep breath here. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  Greenpeace has a right to appeal. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  I think the due process violations in this trial were so serious. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=565.84s)]
*  I think Greenpeace's chances on appeal are very, very good. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=569.88s)]
*  I do not think this is going to shudder Greenpeace. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=573.48s)]
*  What I would say is to people out there who care about these issues, the climate movement, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=576.1999999999999s)]
*  indigenous rights and the right to protest, rally behind Greenpeace. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=580.12s)]
*  It's very important that the courts in North Dakota understand this is being watched all [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=583.68s)]
*  over the world and that it has implications for our entire country. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=588.04s)]
*  I think Greenpeace is going to win the appeal, and my hope is they'll come out much stronger [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=591.92s)]
*  because of this experience. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=595.9599999999999s)]
*  Even though it's painful right now, in the long run, they will come out stronger because [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=597.48s)]
*  of the experience and get even more support. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=601.38s)]
*  Well, Steve Donsogar, I want to thank you for being with us, human rights and environmental [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  defender who monitored the Greenpeace trial in North Dakota. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbpqCunNp0&t=607.84s)]
