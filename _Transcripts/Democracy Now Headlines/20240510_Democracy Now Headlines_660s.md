*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Over 100,000 Gazans have fled Ra'a, as Israel escalates its attacks on the southern city.
*  Deadly aerial attacks on Ra'a have targeted residential and public buildings in the tightly
*  packed area.
*  The Israeli army's closure of Ra'a's border is preventing food and medical supplies from
*  entering Gaza.
*  Community kitchens there say they do not know how much longer they can keep running.
*  Approximately 80 percent of people rely on food from charity kitchens, as they are unable
*  to provide their own meals and drinks.
*  Their entire dependency lies on these charity kitchens.
*  If these kitchens were to close, they would have no means to provide food and drinks.
*  Many individuals have approached us with similar concerns, urging us to attempt to reopen kitchens
*  in their displacement location.
*  We too seek shelter and support.
*  The blockade is being felt throughout Gaza.
*  This is a Jordanian doctor, Ali Abu Khirma, who has been working at Al-Aqsa Hospital and
*  Dar al-Balah in central Gaza.
*  There used to be medical aid coming in, and now there's no medical aid.
*  Now we have operations, but we don't have gauze to use.
*  There is nothing to use.
*  We have a simple operation, an urgent one, which is not related to the war, which is
*  appendicitis.
*  We do not have anything to wear.
*  The gown that we wear, we don't have it.
*  We have become part of the people of Gaza.
*  What happens to them happens to us.
*  We will continue.
*  The same way they are being resilient, we will too.
*  In occupied East Jerusalem, UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, was forced
*  to shut its headquarters after a group of armed Israelis set fire to the compound's
*  perimeter.
*  The European Union condemned the attack, adding, quote,
*  "...it is Israel's responsibility to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers.
*  UNRWA is an irreplaceable lifeline to millions in Gaza and the region," they said.
*  Meanwhile, Gaza solidarity protests continue on U.S. campuses.
*  At Princeton, 10 faculty members are joining 12 students who've already been on hunger
*  strike for a week.
*  We'll be joined by one of the student hunger strikers later in the broadcast.
*  At the University of Pennsylvania, police and riot gear started arresting students early
*  this morning.
*  Yesterday, Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro called for the Ivy League school to, quote,
*  order and safety on campus, after students refused to back down and end their protest
*  until their demands for divestment from Israel were met.
*  At least six students have been suspended.
*  Here in New York, at least 11 people were arrested outside the new school, the site
*  of the nation's first faculty encampment.
*  Democracy Now! was at the new school last night as the arrests were happening.
*  We'll have more on this story after headlines.
*  The Pulitzer Prize-winning author Colson Whitehead has pulled out of his planned commencement
*  speech at UMass Amherst next week, after the police arrested over 100 students there.
*  He said, quote,
*  In a victory for the protest movement, Sacramento State and California agreed to review its
*  investments so that it's not funding corporations that, quote,
*  that violate fundamental human rights, unquote.
*  Outside the United States, Dutch riot police bulldozed a protest camp at the University
*  of Amsterdam after students defied orders to dismantle it.
*  In Sweden, thousands of protesters took to the streets of Malmo Thursday denouncing Israel's
*  participation in the Eurovision Song Contest.
*  Eurovision has rejected mounting demands to ban Israel from the competition over its
*  slaughter in Gaza.
*  Swedish activist Kadegta Tunbari was among the protesters.
*  She also addressed the growing campus protest movement in the U.S. and around the world.
*  I think they should be everywhere.
*  And once again, young people are leading the way, showing the world how we should react
*  to this.
*  Sudan's rapid support forces may have committed genocide as fighters executed thousands of
*  civilians who desperately attempted to flee the West Darfur region last summer.
*  That's according to Human Rights Watch, which collected the testimonies of over 200
*  witnesses who described children still alive being piled up and shot by RSF fighters as
*  part of an ethnic cleansing campaign against the Mas'alit people and other non-Arab communities.
*  The U.N. estimates some 15,000 people may have been killed in El-Geneina last year,
*  while hundreds of thousands were displaced by the violence.
*  A Sudanese woman described to UNICEF how the mother of her 4-year-old niece Yasmin was
*  killed as they fled.
*  Her mother, who was eight months pregnant, was killed, and she, Yasmin, was left all
*  alone.
*  Some people found her on the road and brought her back here.
*  On the road, we suffered a lot.
*  The rapid support forces killed and wounded so many people.
*  We were living peacefully until the conflict broke out.
*  There was shooting near our home, and we were trapped.
*  When we finally managed to get out, we were beaten and robbed.
*  We came with nothing from Sudan.
*  Human Rights Watch is demanding the U.N. and African Union urgently impose an arms embargo
*  on Sudan and deploy security forces to Darfur.
*  In Chad, the interim military ruler, Mohammed Deby, has been declared the winner of the
*  presidential election.
*  General Deby took power after his father, longtime Chadian leader Idris Deby, was killed
*  by rebel forces in 2021.
*  Mohammed Deby's main rival, Prime Minister Saksay Masra, is disputing the results and
*  declared himself the winner just hours before the election results were announced.
*  He called on the citizens of Chad to mobilize calmly.
*  In Argentina, labor unions led a nationwide strike Thursday, bringing transportation and
*  many businesses to a standstill.
*  It was the second general strike against far-right President Javier Mele's austerity and deregulation
*  reforms.
*  Mele also devalued the Argentine peso, causing prices to soar even higher and sending the
*  nation's annual inflation rate to around 300 percent, the highest in the world.
*  Over half the population of Argentina lives in poverty.
*  This is union leader Hector Dajar.
*  This strike was a success.
*  Success is not a goal in itself, and the success of the workers' strike is not an objective
*  in itself.
*  It is a wakeup call to the authorities to find a course to rectify the social damage
*  they are carrying out with the measures they are taking every day.
*  Two accidents on Boeing 737 passenger jets took place Thursday.
*  In Senegal, a 737-300 caught fire and skidded off the runway as it was preparing to take
*  off injuring at least 10 people.
*  In Turkey, a Tyron, a Boeing 737-800 aircraft burst upon landing.
*  The 190 people on board were safely evacuated.
*  Just one day earlier, a Boeing 767 FedEx plane landed at Istanbul Airport without its front
*  landing gear deployed, its nose hitting the runway.
*  The trio of accidents come as another whistleblower, formerly employed by Spirit Aero Systems,
*  Boeing's largest supplier, came forward.
*  Santiago Paredes told reporters he used to regularly find up to 200 defects on fuselages
*  that were being delivered to Boeing.
*  In Florida, the family members of a 23-year-old Air Force member killed by a sheriff's deputy
*  last week are demanding justice.
*  Newly released body camera footage shows Roger Fortson answering the door of his own apartment
*  and immediately being fatally shot by an Ocaloosa County officer.
*  His relatives say the deputy arrived at the wrong apartment, which authorities have refuted.
*  This is the family's attorney, Ben Crump.
*  He had always wanted to serve in the United States Air Force, and he was living his dream.
*  And by doing so, he was going to make it better for his mother and his siblings and his family,
*  so they could have a better chance at their American dream.
*  The Biden administration is preparing new measures that could expedite the deportation
*  of some asylum seekers deemed unlikely to qualify for protection in the early stages
*  of the process.
*  Immigrant rights advocates warn the new rules will further erode due process rights for
*  migrants and disproportionately impact black asylum seekers, who already face tremendous
*  bias and racism from U.S. officials conducting credible fear interviews.
*  In Virginia, the Shenandoah County School Board voted to restore the former names of
*  two elementary schools to honor Confederate leaders.
*  In 2020, the school board stripped the names of Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee and Turner
*  Ashby from the school's names amidst Black Lives Matter uprising following the police
*  killing of George Floyd.
*  The 5-to-1 vote comes after a campaign by right-wing group Coalition for Better Schools.
*  Ahead of the vote, community members and students addressed the board, including eighth grader
*  Aaliyah Ogle.
*  I'm a black student, and if the names are restored, I would have to represent a man
*  that fought for my ancestors to be slaves.
*  That makes me feel like I'm disrespecting my ancestors and going against what my family
*  and I believe.
*  And the University of Southern California hosted its alternative graduation Thursday
*  evening after calling off its mainstage ceremony.
*  USC announced it was not holding its typical commencement ceremony this year amidst a national
*  backlash for canceling the valedictorian Asna Tabassum's speech after she was subjected
*  to an online hate campaign for expressing solidarity with Palestinians.
*  Asna Tabassum's fellow graduates erupted into cheers as she was acknowledged at Thursday's
*  graduation.
*  Asna will graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering, Molecular and Cellular
*  Engineering and a minor in Resistance to Genocide.
*  You may not know this, but Asna is USC's 2024 valedictorian.
*  You can see our interview with Asna Tabassum, the valedictorian at USC, and our coverage
*  of this issue at democracynow.org.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
