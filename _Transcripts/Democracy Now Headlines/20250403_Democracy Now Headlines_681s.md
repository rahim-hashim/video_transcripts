We speak with New York Immigration Coalition President Murad Awawdeh about a mother and three children who were swept up in an ICE raid not far from the home of Trump’s “border czar” Tom Homan in Sackets Harbor, New York, handcuffed and taken to a family detention center in Texas despite having no order of deportation. A protest calling for the family’s return is planned for this Saturday, and the mayor has called a state of emergency. Awawdeh also responds to what appears to be a pattern of collaboration with the Trump administration’s mass deportation plan among local leaders and institutions in New York, from Eric Adams’s mayoral administration to Columbia University. Adams had federal corruption charges against him dropped after agreeing to support increased immigration enforcement, while Columbia had federal funding restored after allowing ICE officers to carry out arrests and searches on campus and in university-owned housing.

# ICE Detains Mother & Her Three Children in Farm Raid Near NY Home of Border Czar Tom Homan
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  As we turn now to look at how a family of four, a mother and three children, were detained [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in a raid not far from the home of Trump's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=9.8s)]
*  border czar, Tom Homan. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=15.96s)]
*  The raid took place last Thursday at the North Harbor Dairy, near the town of Sacketts Harbor, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=17.92s)]
*  a small town with a population of about 1,300. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=26.0s)]
*  It's in upstate New York, in western New York. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=30.28s)]
*  In total, seven people were detained, including the mother and her three kids, who were enrolled [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=33.36s)]
*  in a local public school, a third grader, a tenth grader and an eleventh grader. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=38.2s)]
*  Witnesses say they were all handcuffed before being removed from a home at the dairy farm [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=43.56s)]
*  and put in a van. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=47.68s)]
*  ICE has confirmed they were then taken to a recently reopened family detention center [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=48.68s)]
*  in Texas. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=53.44s)]
*  This is Jennifer Gaffney, the superintendent of Sacketts Harbor Central School District. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  As part of the process of detaining the person for whom the warrant was issued, we had three [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=60.76s)]
*  students who got caught up in that mess and subsequently taken and detained. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=69.12s)]
*  We are all very, very, very well connected with our students who are missing, and these [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=74.88s)]
*  students are friends, they're classmates, they're good students and they're part of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=79.12s)]
*  the fabric of our community and we want them back in our classrooms. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=83.44s)]
*  The superintendent was interviewed by local ABC Upstate. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=86.84s)]
*  ICE agents said the mother and children were collateral arrests and that the raid on the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=90.28s)]
*  dairy farm was related to a warrant to arrest of a South African man allegedly dealing in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=94.12s)]
*  child pornography. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=99.0s)]
*  This Saturday, community members are holding a rally starting at the town's welcome center [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=100.86s)]
*  marching to the home of Trump Borders' R. Tom Homan, who's a native of the area. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=104.8s)]
*  He spoke to the local news station, WWNY, and said he was looking into the raid and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=109.32s)]
*  the possibility the family could be released and returned to Sacketts Harbor. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=113.96s)]
*  This was not, you know, it wasn't a raid, it was a search warrant execution in a house [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=117.72s)]
*  where a family was found and who entered the country legally. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=124.08s)]
*  They're under doctorate control. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=128.56s)]
*  So ICE is doing everything by the book. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=130.72s)]
*  Orbitro did everything by the book. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=133.04s)]
*  Once the investigation gets to a place where we no longer have an interest in this family, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=135.68s)]
*  then the decision will be made on release. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=143.24s)]
*  So as far as Sacketts Harbor, I grew up, as you know, in West Carthage, not too far from [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  your family. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=149.96s)]
*  I love the North Country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=150.96s)]
*  I want to retire in the North Country. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=151.96s)]
*  It's unfortunate that this brings unnecessary attention to a small town that I love, small [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=153.6s)]
*  town that I'd like to retire in. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=165.11999999999998s)]
*  For more, we're joined by Marado Alda, the president of the New York Immigration Coalition, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  helping residents as they call for ICE to release this family. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  Marad, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=175.2s)]
*  Can you explain what happened to this family of four, almost next-door neighbors, to Homan, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  the third grader, that two high school kids and their mom were handcuffed and taken away? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=185.32s)]
*  Well, first, thank you for having me. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=192.24s)]
*  It's really unfortunate to see this family, who in the dark of morning were snatched from [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  their beds, arrested and then detained and then disappeared. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  Similarly, we've been seeing this happen across the country, but even more so appalling, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=207.84s)]
*  that ICE figured that it was important that they arrest these children and their mother, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  which they had no warrant to enter their home, which they did, as well as ensuring that they [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=218.44s)]
*  not only arrested them, but they moved them over 1,800 miles away from their home and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  their community. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  So, it's been incredibly heartening to see the local community of Sacketts Harbor rally [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  in support of this family and their students, but we're all calling for the same thing, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=238.4s)]
*  which is the immediate release and return of this family back to New York. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=243.96s)]
*  So, what are their rights? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=249.8s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting Homan has been so fierce in his rhetoric against immigrants, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  but now that people in his community, it sounds like he's beginning to back off. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=259.04s)]
*  Well, his community has been loud and clear. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=266.44s)]
*  They are not in support of these warrantless arrests. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=270.68s)]
*  They are not in support of family separation or child detainment. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=275.40000000000003s)]
*  You have these three children and their mother now sitting in what is in essence a jail and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=280.68s)]
*  a prison in Texas and continuing to parrot these talking points as if ICE and him are [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=286.44s)]
*  in the right when we know that they're in the wrong. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=295.24s)]
*  This family actually was going through the immigration system as they were told to, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=298.04s)]
*  following the process and the steps that was dictated to them by the immigration court. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=302.6s)]
*  And now instead of waiting for their court date, they are sitting in a family detention [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=307.92s)]
*  center in Texas awaiting their fate, which is really horrendous. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  And again, we're calling on their immediate release and for them to be sent back to New [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=318.56s)]
*  York. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=323.88s)]
*  Protests for Saturday at 2 p.m. plan, and the mayor of Sackets Harbor says he's going [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=325.24s)]
*  to—says they're going to declare a state of emergency as they march to Homan's house? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=328.8s)]
*  I think that this case specifically has drawn a lot of interest and outrage from the local [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=336.6s)]
*  community as well as the surrounding areas. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=341.52s)]
*  North Country is a beautiful part of New York state. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=346.04s)]
*  It is hundreds of miles away from New York City, but even more so in a community of Sackets [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=349.64s)]
*  Harbor of, you know, 1,300 or so residents, they are all outraged. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=356.12s)]
*  This is a farming community, and even the farmer, who this action happened on his property, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=363.08s)]
*  is also outraged. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=368.91999999999996s)]
*  And I think in this moment what they are demanding is they want their kids to come back to them. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  These are their students. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  These are their friends. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=376.03999999999996s)]
*  These are their neighbors. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  And they're incredibly, incredibly horrified that this happened to begin with. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=379.0s)]
*  And I don't know if anyone can imagine a third grader being arrested or other kids [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=383.64000000000004s)]
*  being arrested simply because of, you know, ICE wanting to meet their quota of the day. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=389.68s)]
*  And there wasn't a deportation order, and they were showing up at court for their various [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=396.76s)]
*  hearings? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=402.20000000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=403.20000000000005s)]
*  There was no order. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=404.84s)]
*  There was no warrant. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=405.96s)]
*  And they were still navigating the immigration system. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=407.67999999999995s)]
*  I also want to ask you about New York Mayor Eric Adams, who today is making his first [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=411.03999999999996s)]
*  mayoral campaign appearance of 2025 after a federal judge dismissed his corruption case, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=415.23999999999995s)]
*  granting a request from the Justice Department that was widely seen as a quid pro quo in [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=421.28s)]
*  exchange for Adams implementing Trump's mass deportation agenda. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=425.28s)]
*  But the judge, Dale Ho, dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning the charges cannot [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=429.56s)]
*  be later revived, going against the wishes of the Justice Department, which sought to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=436.0s)]
*  leave the door open for potential future prosecution, perhaps if Adams didn't do what they wanted. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=440.84s)]
*  The judge wrote, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=448.28s)]
*  "'Everything here smacks of a bargain, dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=449.72s)]
*  policy concessions.'" [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=454.2s)]
*  Earlier today, Adams announced he plans to run for reelection as an independent instead [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=456.76000000000005s)]
*  of as a Democrat. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=460.88000000000005s)]
*  Your assessment of what's going on here, Murat? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=462.68s)]
*  You know, I think this doesn't really change very much. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=465.36s)]
*  There was, obviously, as per the AUSAs, who quit because they refused to dismiss these [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  charges, that there was a quid pro quo. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=476.36s)]
*  When you say AUSAs, you mean assistant U.S. attorneys, one after another, conservative [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=478.36s)]
*  saying they did not want to drop the charges against the mayor? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=484.56s)]
*  Yeah, and that their case was based on facts. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=489.64000000000004s)]
*  You know, we, as myself and my organization, had never called for his resignation because [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=493.12s)]
*  he was charged, because we believe, although he doesn't believe this for our community, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  but we believe every single person in this country has the right to due process, including [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=503.32s)]
*  the mayor. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=508.0s)]
*  But what transpired here was not that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=509.52000000000004s)]
*  We echo the sentiments of the judge in saying that there was a bargain struck here, and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=512.96s)]
*  we don't know what that is, but the allusion that has been made through the assistant U.S. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=519.6s)]
*  attorneys and their comments is that this is a deal that was cut to ensure that the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=524.1999999999999s)]
*  mayor supports the Trump administration's mass deportation plan, which we are completely [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=530.08s)]
*  because that is nothing but actually horrifying for our families, negatively impacting our [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=537.76s)]
*  communities, and it will gut our local economy. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=544.36s)]
*  So the mayor has a tough road ahead. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=547.4s)]
*  I think that if he does try to collude with immigration enforcement against local law, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=550.24s)]
*  we're going to fight tooth and nail and work with our partners in the New York City [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNEWddQ2Gk&t=556.84s)]
