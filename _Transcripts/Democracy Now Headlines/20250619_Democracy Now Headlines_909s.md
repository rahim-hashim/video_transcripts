**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=4.68s)]
*  As we continue our Juneteenth special, we turn now to the pioneering musical artist [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=6.12s)]
*  Rhiannon Giddens. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=11.52s)]
*  She first gained fame as a member of the Grammy Award-winning Carolina Chocolate Drops, a [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=13.22s)]
*  black string band which inspired a new generation of black musicians to play the banjo and fiddle. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=18.84s)]
*  Giddens has gone on to have a celebrated solo career and has even collaborated with Beyoncé. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=25.24s)]
*  Giddens' banjo playing can be heard on Texas Hold'em, a hit single by Beyoncé, who became [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=31.04s)]
*  the first black woman to ever top the Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=36.2s)]
*  In 2023, Rhiannon Giddens won a Pulitzer Prize for her opera Omar about Omar ibn Said, a [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=41.32s)]
*  Muslim scholar in Africa sold into slavery and forcefully brought to Charleston, South [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  Carolina, in 1807. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=54.08s)]
*  In a moment, we'll hear Rhiannon Giddens talk about Omar, but first an excerpt from [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=57.04s)]
*  the song Julie's Aria from the opera Omar. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=61.76s)]
*  My daddy wore a cap like yours. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=65.04s)]
*  He got down on his knees and he faced the rising sun and he did it again when the day [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=77.52s)]
*  was done. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=86.72s)]
*  That's Julie's Aria from Rhiannon Giddens' Pulitzer Prize-winning opera Omar, which she [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=93.91999999999999s)]
*  wrote with Michael Abels. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=99.12s)]
*  I spoke to her in October 2023, on the day she received the Pulitzer Prize. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=100.88s)]
*  Rhiannon, this is just astounding. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=107.44s)]
*  Can you talk about the life of Omar ibn Said? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=110.96s)]
*  I can, yeah. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=114.56s)]
*  He was a 37-year-old Quranic scholar. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=115.84s)]
*  He'd been studying, you know, for all of his adult life, even when he was a child. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=119.84s)]
*  And he was 37 years old and he was sold into slavery. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  His compound was overrun and he was sold and he had to go over the Middle Passage and he [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=131.44s)]
*  ended up in Charleston, was his first protocol. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=138.32s)]
*  And he was sold to a man there that he, I think, used him pretty badly, like put him [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=140.24s)]
*  in the fields and treated him very badly. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=146.4s)]
*  And he ran away from him and he ended up in North Carolina. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  And they found him in a jail. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=154.68s)]
*  They put him in jail because you couldn't just be a random black person walking around. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  Somebody had to own you or you were, you know, imprisoned. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=161.76s)]
*  And so he was put into jail and he was found there and he had written on the walls with [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=164.56s)]
*  the ashes verses of the Quran. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=172.24s)]
*  And so he was sold to a family in North Carolina where he lived out the rest of his life another [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=175.08s)]
*  50 years. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  He lived into his 80s and was never freed. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  And the reason we know who he is is that he wrote an autobiography in Arabic. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=185.84s)]
*  So he was pressed upon to write the story of his life, even though he begins it with [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=190.36s)]
*  I cannot write my life, because this was 20 years after he had been brought to the United [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=194.36s)]
*  States. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=201.08s)]
*  And it's just a remarkable document. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=202.34s)]
*  It's the only—as best as the scholars who have told me, no, it's the only autobiography [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  written by an enslaved person while they are enslaved that we have, you know, anywhere [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=210.44s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=215.76s)]
*  And it's definitely the only document written in Arabic by an enslaved person. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=216.76s)]
*  So it's a really special thing that we have it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=220.48s)]
*  And I was commissioned by the Spoleto Festivals, the first opera they commissioned, to write [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=224.24s)]
*  an opera. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=229.0s)]
*  And I brought in Michael Abels, who's an incredible composer and film scorer and who [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=230.0s)]
*  knows the orchestra and knows how to write for orchestra. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=233.54s)]
*  I know how to write for banjo and for voice. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=236.64s)]
*  So between the two of us, we created the score for Omar, and I wrote the libretto. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=238.82s)]
*  And it was a really intense experience, you know. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=244.14s)]
*  But it's just so amazing that Omar's story has been—is being lifted by this opera, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=249.94s)]
*  being lifted by the existence of this work, and more and more people are knowing about [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=256.78s)]
*  him, because the whole point for me was to complicate the—again, the complication, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=261.62s)]
*  to complicate the American narrative, like who gets to say that they represent the American [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=267.18s)]
*  story, you know? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=271.62s)]
*  Why is the Mayflower's—you know, somebody who came on the Mayflower, why is that held [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=273.34000000000003s)]
*  up as representational when Omar is just as representational? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=279.82s)]
*  It's just not as—you know, it's not as pleasant. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=284.22s)]
*  It's very challenging. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=287.7s)]
*  And also that there were so many Muslims that were brought over to the United States, and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=290.14s)]
*  a massive impact on the culture and in some places, the language, you know, if you go [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=295.54s)]
*  to the Georgia Sea Islands, where you can trace some of the words in Gullah to Arabic. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=300.90000000000003s)]
*  So it's just an opportunity to really just kind of blow things wide open and go, well, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=307.66s)]
*  this is another huge part of the story that hasn't been told. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  And going through the life of Omar, you can really represent that in a way that's just [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=316.06s)]
*  really remarkable, because he was remarkable, you know? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=321.62s)]
*  He was remarkable that he was able to hold on to his faith. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=324.42s)]
*  He quoted the Qur'an until he died, you know, and he was by himself. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=327.7s)]
*  He wasn't, like, you know, surrounded by people that—you know, like he was when he [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=331.62s)]
*  was back home, and he has to carry the whole thing on his own. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=336.3s)]
*  You know, he has to remember the verses. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=340.26s)]
*  He has to remember the language. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=342.26s)]
*  He has to do it all in isolation. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=343.26s)]
*  And that's just—you know, it's a thing. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=345.74s)]
*  And he did it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=348.21999999999997s)]
*  And now he left something so that we can, you know, look at his words and go, wow, what [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=349.21999999999997s)]
*  a—what a remarkable life. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=354.14000000000004s)]
*  Breanne, and you talk about Omar living out his years in North Carolina. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=355.38s)]
*  You were born in North Carolina, in Greensboro. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=359.82000000000005s)]
*  Can you talk about your own indigenous and African-American roots and how you first picked [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=364.5s)]
*  up the banjo, how you got involved with music, the trajectory of your life and all of the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=371.46000000000004s)]
*  musical forms that you have now excelled in and expressed yourself in? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=378.3s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=383.70000000000005s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=384.70000000000005s)]
*  How much—how long do you have? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=385.70000000000005s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=386.70000000000005s)]
*  I'll give you the capsule version. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=387.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I'm from North Carolina, from a mixed family, mixed black and white, and I know [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=389.1s)]
*  indigenous—you know, back there, it's kind of a typical Southern story of black, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=395.26000000000005s)]
*  white and red, mixed in sort of indiscriminate ways. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=400.74s)]
*  And I don't claim a tribal affiliation. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=403.74s)]
*  I like to say I'm, like, Native adjacent, you know? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=406.5s)]
*  I know I've got cousins who identify as Native, but I myself use that story to try [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=410.02000000000004s)]
*  to raise awareness and to highlight and to ally myself with the Native story, the indigenous [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=417.1s)]
*  story, because so many indigenous people feel invisible, because, you know, a lot of mainstream [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=425.22s)]
*  culture just assumes that that was past, and there's not even—sure, there's no Indians [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=431.06s)]
*  around, you know? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=435.42s)]
*  And I use the word Indian because a lot of people, especially in North Carolina, consider [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=436.42s)]
*  themselves as Indian, Indian country, Indian culture. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=439.3s)]
*  So it's, you know, it's complicated, and not any group is monolithic, including indigenous [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=441.94s)]
*  people. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=447.74s)]
*  And then, you know, obviously there's black and white, and that's been the main—my [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=448.74s)]
*  main sort of affiliation. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=454.46s)]
*  And I didn't know anything about Omar's story, which made me so mad, because I was [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=457.26s)]
*  born and raised in North Carolina, but anyway, that's—you know, that's another thing. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=460.7s)]
*  So I just grew up, you know, as a Southerner, and I grew up with my grandparents at first, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=464.86s)]
*  and living out in the country and listening to hee-haw and listening to blues and jazz [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=470.3s)]
*  records and just whatever they were listening to. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=476.21999999999997s)]
*  And, you know, over the years, I've got a lot of different music from different people, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=478.78s)]
*  my dad, my sister, my mom, my grandparents, and just sort of took it all in and went to [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=483.53999999999996s)]
*  to Oberlin, graduated with a bachelor's in music. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=490.22s)]
*  You know, I was loved to opera. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=494.5s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=495.5s)]
*  I still love it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=496.5s)]
*  You know, soprano, I did a bunch of operas. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=497.5s)]
*  It was Juliet. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=499.18s)]
*  It was all of these things. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=500.18s)]
*  And then I came back home, and I was like, what am I doing? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=501.98s)]
*  You know, like, what am I doing in opera that, like, a million other sopranos can't do [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=504.66s)]
*  is good or better than me? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=508.58000000000004s)]
*  Like, what am I bringing? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=509.94000000000005s)]
*  I remember thinking this, you know? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=511.3s)]
*  And while I was trying to figure that out, I started contra-dancing, like square dancing, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=513.6600000000001s)]
*  It's a community dance, you know? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=519.0999999999999s)]
*  And that's when I fell in love with the banjo, because there were always live bands, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=521.3399999999999s)]
*  a lot of old-time bands. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=524.42s)]
*  And then I found out the history of the banjo, and then I was kind of record scratch time. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=525.74s)]
*  You know, that was it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=530.6999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't just because I love the banjo, but I felt the injustice of having been raised [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=532.8199999999999s)]
*  in North Carolina, surrounded by banjo music, not knowing the true history of the banjo, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=538.8399999999999s)]
*  wanting to learn the banjo and feeling like I had to ask permission, you know? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=544.3399999999999s)]
*  And then finding out that the banjo itself is a black instrument and that the tradition [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=548.66s)]
*  itself is a Creole tradition that's a cross-cultural collaborative tradition, and that I didn't [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=552.14s)]
*  have to ask any permission to play this music, because it was my music, you know? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=556.66s)]
*  And I just got really upset, you know? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=561.54s)]
*  I just got mad. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=564.3s)]
*  I was just like, why haven't I been told this? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=565.3s)]
*  You know, why don't I know this? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=569.14s)]
*  And then immediately falling on the heels of that question was, and in whose best interest [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=570.62s)]
*  is it that I don't know this thing? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=574.3s)]
*  And so that just kind of set me off on my path of, you know, trying to uncover, to discover, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=576.76s)]
*  to shine a light, you know? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=582.54s)]
*  And just—I've just kind of gone where I've been led, really, because I just—I [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=586.68s)]
*  love—I love all the stories, the stories that we don't hear, you know, in our school [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=592.74s)]
*  the stories that aren't deemed interesting enough or that deviate from the narrative [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=598.34s)]
*  of this is white and this is black and brown doesn't exist and, you know, let's keep [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=603.4200000000001s)]
*  everything separated so that they don't realize that we're schnookering them all. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=607.74s)]
*  So talk about being a part of the Carolina Chocolate Drops, and then I want to ask you [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=611.0600000000001s)]
*  about our Native Daughters, Rhiannon. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=616.02s)]
*  Of course. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=618.38s)]
*  Yeah, the Carolina Chocolate Drops is a, you know, black string band that was formed around [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=619.38s)]
*  2006 and kind of the center of it was learning from Joe Thompson, who was an 86-year-old [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=625.1s)]
*  African-American fiddler from Ebbett, North Carolina that was one of the last black proponents [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=631.9s)]
*  of the old string band position, not the only black fiddler, you know, left in the country, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=636.9s)]
*  but one of the last of that kind of old time, you know, black string band tradition, rural [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=641.26s)]
*  tradition where it had been passed down as an oral tradition from the time of slavery. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=647.22s)]
*  And so, you know, we wanted to take that out into the world and educate about that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=653.18s)]
*  So it was myself, Dom Flemmons, and Justin Robinson were the original members of the [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=660.3399999999999s)]
*  Chocolate Drops. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=664.18s)]
*  Over the years there would be different really super talented black instrumentalists and [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=665.18s)]
*  singers who have come into the group and gone on to do great things like Laila McCalla, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=670.9399999999999s)]
*  Hubby Jenkins. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=674.9399999999999s)]
*  The first trio was myself, Dom, and Justin, and we were the ones who worked with Joe Thompson [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=676.4799999999999s)]
*  for some years. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=682.78s)]
*  And then our Native Daughters and songs of our Native Daughters, which highlight the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=684.62s)]
*  struggle, the resistance, the hope of black women resonating back to the 17th, the 18th [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=691.2199999999999s)]
*  and 19th century. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=697.9s)]
*  Talk about your work there. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=699.56s)]
*  Yeah, I was in the Smithsonian—the Museum for African-American Culture, History and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=701.3399999999999s)]
*  Culture at Smithsonian and in D.C. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=708.0999999999999s)]
*  And I was just really struck with some of the historical exhibits and I was just thinking [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=711.8599999999999s)]
*  that, God, we need to be making music from these really hard things. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=714.8599999999999s)]
*  And it just kind of turned into this project. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=719.9s)]
*  I, you know, was—they asked me to record something for them and I said, I'm just thinking, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=724.54s)]
*  okay, here's the project. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=732.18s)]
*  I want to do something with these historical things in the Smithsonian. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=733.3s)]
*  And then it just kind of like, as I was thinking about who to do it with, you know, the women, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=739.66s)]
*  the story of women, especially black women, really is what has driven me a lot in my solo [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=743.5799999999999s)]
*  work. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=749.38s)]
*  You know, my earliest songwriting dealt with women during the slavery times and coming [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=750.38s)]
*  from enslaved narratives and different paraphernalia around slavery but always centering women [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=754.9s)]
*  because I felt like that's not the stories we get. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=761.58s)]
*  You know, even if we get enslaved stories, we don't always get—other than Harriet [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=764.7800000000001s)]
*  Tubman, that's kind of it. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=767.74s)]
*  And so the opportunity to bring three other black women, you know, together with myself [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=770.9000000000001s)]
*  and then I wanted the banjo to be central because it's also been so maligned and so [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=776.98s)]
*  misunderstood. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=782.34s)]
*  And it's so central to American culture, you know, that I wanted it to be other banjo [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=784.62s)]
*  playing black women. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=791.66s)]
*  So, I mean, I keep telling people, like, there's more than just me. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=792.66s)]
*  There's a lot of us, actually, at this point, you know. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=796.3399999999999s)]
*  Rhiannon, can you tell us your favorite song from our Native daughters? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=798.74s)]
*  Oh, gosh. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=803.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, I love them all, but, like, I think Moon Meets Sun was one of the first ones that [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=807.9s)]
*  we wrote, and it was one that three of us wrote together. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=817.46s)]
*  Laila wasn't there that day, it was me and Ali and Amethyst, and it really has all three [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=821.38s)]
*  of us in it. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=825.26s)]
*  And that's just—that was just a magic moment. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=827.1800000000001s)]
*  We just kind of went, OK, this is a thing. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=829.22s)]
*  Like, this is so cool. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=830.82s)]
*  We don't have to explain ourselves to each other. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=832.5s)]
*  We don't have to, like—you know, we just, like—there was just this magic moment. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=834.9s)]
*  There was just so much that we didn't have to do because we all were like, yeah, yeah, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=837.78s)]
*  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=841.14s)]
*  And it was just—it kind of made for a really wonderful communal energy that surrounded [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=842.78s)]
*  the song, so that's definitely one of my favorites. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=847.1s)]
*  The pioneering musical artist Rhiannon Giddens. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=867.74s)]
*  We spoke in October 2023, the day she received the Pulitzer Prize for her opera Omar. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyh2SUz3jg&t=881.66s)]
