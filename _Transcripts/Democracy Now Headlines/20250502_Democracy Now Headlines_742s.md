People around the world celebrated May Day, International Workers’ Day, on Thursday, including hundreds of thousands in the United States. Unions and immigrant rights groups led rallies from coast to coast, in every state, with much of their anger directed at the Trump administration.  Workers and activists in New York demanded workers’ rights, freedom for Palestine and protections for immigrants. Democracy Now!’s María Inés Taracena spoke to some of the marchers as they took to the streets. “It’s just giving me a huge boost of hope that we’re going to get over this authoritarian scheme and we’ll come out on top,” said Barry Knittle, a protester in New York.

*  And we are joined by brothers and sisters across the country. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=139.04s)]
*  And one of the things that I've just learned coming up on this stage is we've been rallying [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=143.24s)]
*  in Idaho, 12,000 people in Idaho, 36,000 in Los Angeles, 34,000 in Denver, 23,000 in Tucson, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=147.12s)]

*  And as I was walking up to this stage, we found out that they have stopped and suspended [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=170.23999999999998s)]

*  Tour. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  Democracy Now!'s María Inés Teresina was in the streets as thousands marched in New [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  York and spoke to some of the protesters. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=202.04s)]
*  My name is Councilmember Tiffany Galán. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=212.35999999999999s)]

*  What is the significance of this day? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  It's May Day. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  What does May Day mean to you and everyone who's gathered here in the era of Trump's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=221.44000000000003s)]
*  second presidency? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=226.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=227.28s)]
*  I mean, May Day, it represents a very united struggle, one of intersectional solidarity. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=228.28s)]
*  May Day represents all of the labor wins that working people have won throughout decades. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=237.24s)]
*  And it really represents the energy of the fight that we are ready to put up against [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=244.24s)]
*  this Trump administration, especially when we know that the administration is the enemy [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=249.6s)]
*  to the worker. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=254.67999999999998s)]
*  And so it's a beautiful thing to say all workers, we're standing with each other. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  And you see it out in this crowd. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=259.36s)]
*  You have unions, you have community-based organizations, you have immigrant workers, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=260.88s)]
*  queer and trans workers. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=265.68s)]
*  You have workers of every stripe, color, and creed. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=267.84s)]
*  And it's a really beautiful thing. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=271.88s)]
*  And also, we know that this is the last line of defense, especially at the local level. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=273.28s)]
*  So getting really clear about what our agenda is, what exactly we are going to be fighting for. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=278.72s)]
*  My name is Luz Campoverde. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm a member of Laborers Local 79. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=294.56s)]
*  We are here to fight for our rights, to fight for our freedom, to fight for dignified work [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=300.36s)]
*  and for respect for our immigrant brothers and sisters, regardless of being undocumented [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=306.44s)]
*  or not. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=311.79999999999995s)]
*  We want freedom to work to support our families, our children. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  My message is that without immigrants, the United States would suffer. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=322.11999999999995s)]
*  Our work has enriched this country. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=326.84s)]
*  We are hard workers. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  We are fighters. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=332.85999999999996s)]
*  We are not criminals. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=333.94s)]
*  My name is Quina Moore. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=342.78000000000003s)]
*  I am a trans woman of color, born of a black Cuban refugee who is my father. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=343.78000000000003s)]
*  And I was born from an immigrant. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=350.66s)]
*  I understand the importance of fighting for the liberation of migrants. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=353.66s)]
*  I chose to dress like the Statue of Liberty in shackles because the Statue of Liberty [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=359.7s)]
*  used to be a beacon of hope for those seeking refuge and those seeking asylum and those [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=365.9s)]
*  seeking a sense of liberty. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=370.7s)]
*  People who want to work and people who want to be here and feel safe, who have a right [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=373.38s)]
*  to be here and a right to feel safe. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=377.06s)]
*  But that is not extended to people who are black migrants, people who are brown migrants, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=379.58s)]
*  people who speak something other than English. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=387.62s)]
*  We are living where racism is dominating our communities. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=391.62s)]
*  Hopefully we are able to fight for the liberation and a unified solidarity among the working [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=397.62s)]
*  class. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=406.62s)]
*  We don't get it! [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=407.62s)]
*  Shut it down! [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=408.62s)]
*  We don't get it! [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=409.62s)]
*  Shut it down! [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=411.62s)]
*  My name is T.D. Mitchell. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=413.62s)]
*  I'm a professional writer and a member of the Writers Guild of America. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=415.62s)]
*  I've been a union member since I was 18 years old. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=419.62s)]
*  So the fight of labor has always been my fight. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=423.62s)]
*  My mom is also a union member, a state employees union member. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=427.62s)]
*  And she really instilled in me the desire to protest, the desire to make some noise [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=433.62s)]
*  and make good trouble. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=441.62s)]
*  I think it's very important as a disabled person, as a wheelchair user, to represent [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=442.62s)]
*  those in my community who are too ill and in bed and cannot be here to advocate for [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=451.62s)]
*  themselves. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=457.62s)]
*  So I feel that while I have the capacity, it is incumbent upon me to do that, to represent [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=458.62s)]
*  more than just me here today. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=466.62s)]
*  The mighty, mighty union! [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=469.62s)]
*  The organized union! [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=472.62s)]
*  The organized union! [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=475.62s)]
*  I've been to a lot of rallies in my day, obviously. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=478.62s)]
*  And I've got to say, this is one of the most powerful rallies I've been to. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=482.62s)]
*  And I think it's because the unions are here and the unions are so united. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=487.62s)]
*  It is just giving me a huge boost of hope that we're going to get over this authoritarian [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=491.62s)]
*  scheme and we'll come out on top. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=499.62s)]
*  And I really feel that with all my heart. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=502.62s)]
*  I'm just grateful to the unions. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=505.62s)]
*  We're on the precipice of losing our democracy. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=507.62s)]
*  These authoritarian Republicans and their sycophants that are enabling them are putting [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=511.62s)]
*  our democracy at risk. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=520.62s)]
*  I feel like they're acting with such impunity now that it's sort of scary. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=522.62s)]
*  They must feel that they don't have to worry about losing elections anymore. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=526.62s)]
*  And we have to show them that, yes, they do. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=530.62s)]
*  We're not going to take this lying down. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=533.62s)]
*  My name is Kristin Planders. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=535.62s)]
*  I'm an actor and an SDC union member. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=537.62s)]
*  But my sign says, support federal workers. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=540.62s)]
*  The CDC saved my daughter's life. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=544.62s)]
*  When I was pregnant, I was told that I had contracted measles, but the only place where [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=548.62s)]
*  it could be proved was at the CDC. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=554.62s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=557.62s)]
*  I was going to cry. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=558.62s)]
*  They had to take some amniotic fluid from me and they had to send it. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=560.62s)]
*  There was only one place in the country that tested my amniotic fluid, and it was the CDC. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=563.62s)]
*  And I did not have measles. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=569.62s)]
*  So I was getting advice that I should terminate the pregnancy. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=571.62s)]
*  And I have a great daughter because of the CDC. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=575.62s)]
*  Thank you for sharing your story. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=579.62s)]
*  And what is your message to, right now we're seeing a measles epidemic, the Secretary of [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=581.62s)]
*  Health and Human Services, RFK Jr., spreading this information. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=587.62s)]
*  What is your message to him and your message to the Trump administration trying to dismantle [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=593.62s)]
*  federal agencies like the CDC? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=598.62s)]
*  My message to RFK would be, I went to school. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=601.62s)]
*  I went to school with kids who were severely damaged because their parents' mothers had [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=604.62s)]
*  measles when they were pregnant. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=610.62s)]
*  And the most important thing is vaccination for public health. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=613.62s)]
*  We have eradicated it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=617.62s)]
*  And it's irresponsible. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=620.62s)]
*  And science is a great and effective and a wonderful thing. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=622.62s)]
*  And we have to trust it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=627.62s)]
*  I think it's packed. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=629.62s)]
*  And looking at the news, reading the news and seeing what is happening in the last 100 [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=631.62s)]
*  days, I don't think one can help but be moved and angry and inspired to do just a little [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=638.62s)]
*  bit, even if it's to be part of the march, to see if we can turn things around. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=648.62s)]
*  It's scary. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=654.62s)]
*  I'm a naturalized citizen, and I don't think I'm any safer than anybody who's there. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=656.62s)]
*  When you get to feeling that way, you feel frustrated and you just want to do something. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=662.62s)]
*  I've been a naturalized citizen for over 20 years, but it's still scary, you know? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=669.62s)]
*  And I tell my friends, they come for them today, they're coming for us in the morning. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=676.62s)]
*  I just want to do whatever I can, whenever I can. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=682.62s)]
*  And where are you from and what are you fighting for and who are you fighting for? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=686.62s)]
*  Originally, I'm from Grenada in the West Indies. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=690.62s)]
*  I've been here since 1968. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=694.62s)]
*  I went to school, I worked at one company for 31 years. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=696.62s)]
*  And I'm fighting for my granddaughter, who's three years old, and one who's 16 years old, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=701.62s)]
*  because I don't think things will be the same if we continue this way. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=707.62s)]
*  The opportunities that I've had, I don't think they'll happen. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=711.62s)]
*  And it hurts my heart to see people just getting picked up and you don't hear anything about it. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=715.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S830Tfqkb60&t=741.62s)]
