*  Israeli troops destroyed roads, water infrastructure and a health clinic run by UNRWA, the UN refugee

*  the camp.
*  Israeli forces also reportedly detained and beat a number of Palestinians during the deadly
*  raid.
*  One Palestinian, named Osama Shaheen, said Israeli troops wrote numbers on the forehead
*  of each prisoner.
*  At the time of dawn prayers exactly, they raided the house.
*  They broke down the door and damaged everything in the house.
*  Nothing was left in the house.
*  I was beaten from the moment I left the house to when we went to Majnouneh.
*  They brought me back here.
*  All sorts of beatings, all sorts of beatings.
*  On my chest, on my head.
*  It was severe.
*  Each one got a number on his forehead.
*  And in the army jeep, everyone there hits you.
*  Everyone hits you.
*  Most of the beating is to the head.
*  Mostly to the head.
*  The Washington Post is reporting Israel's bombing campaign in southern Lebanon is now

*  In election news, Kamala Harris campaigned in Arizona Thursday and blasted Donald Trump
*  for saying he's going to protect women, whether the women like it or not.
*  And this is not the first time he has told us who he is.
*  He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about
*  their own bodies.
*  This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices.
*  He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know
*  what's in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly.
*  During Harris's speech in Phoenix, Arizona, she was repeatedly interrupted by pro-Palestinian
*  protesters.
*  Donald Trump was also in Arizona Thursday, where he campaigned with Tucker Carlson.
*  Trump suggested former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney should face a firing squad.
*  Cheney and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, have both backed Harris in the
*  race.
*  And I don't blame him for sticking with his daughter, but his daughter is a very dumb
*  individual, very dumb.
*  She's a radical war hawk.
*  Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK?
*  Let's see how she feels about it.
*  You know, when the guns are trained on her face.
*  Liz Cheney responded by writing, quote, This is how dictators destroy free nations.

*  They'll force you to kill civilians if you want to defend yourself.
*  Spain has declared three days of national mourning after the death toll from devastating
*  flash flooding soared to 158.
*  Most of the deaths were in Valencia, where flooding up rooted trees, downed power lines,
*  demolished bridges and roads and left hundreds of cars strewn about like toys half-buried
*  in the mud.
*  The disaster struck as unprecedented storms brought a year's worth of rainfall in just
*  eight hours.
*  Well, it's all destroyed.
*  Shops, supermarkets, schools, cars, it's all destroyed.
*  These caravans come from the 27th neighborhood, almost in Valencia.
*  They went all the way down until here, and just here on the right, there's a boat.
*  It has been incredible, mind-blowing.
*  Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is warning devastation caused by flash flooding is not

*  rain today.

*  weeks.

*  Foreign Minister Justin Klackchenko said, quote,
*  Papua New Guinea says it will instead seek to forge bilateral climate agreements with
*  other nations.
*  North Korea's Foreign Minister Choe San-hwe is visiting Moscow, as about 10,000 North
*  Korean forces have arrived near Ukraine's border to fight alongside Russian troops.
*  Meanwhile, North Korea test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile Thursday, demonstrating its
*  ability to launch nuclear attacks that could reach the mainland, the United States.
*  Former Philippines President Rajuco Duterte has admitted under oath he oversaw a death
*  squad of gangsters he used to target people while he served as mayor of the southern city
*  of Davao.
*  Duterte made the admission during Testimony Monday to a Philippine Senate inquiry into
*  widespread extrajudicial police and vigilante killings carried out under Duterte's so-called
*  war on drugs.
*  I have a death squad, a death squad, seven of them, but they are the police.
*  They were gangsters.
*  I command one of the gangsters, kill that, because if you don't, I will kill you.
*  A United Nations report found at least 8,600 people were killed in the drug war unleashed
*  by Duterte, with some estimates suggesting the true toll could be three times higher.

*  city councilwoman Marielle Franco and her driver in 2018 were sentenced Thursday to
*  long prison terms.
*  Rony Lassa, who admitted to firing the fatal shots, was sentenced to nearly 79 years.
*  Elcio de Queiroz, who drove the getaway car, received a nearly 60-year sentence.
*  Following Thursday's verdict, Marielle's sister, the black activist, journalist and
*  educator Aniele Franco, spoke out.
*  Since last year, she has served as Brazil's minister of racial equality.
*  Since the beginning, we said we would not stop until justice was made.
*  It was a lot of nights, days, years, taking care of my parents.
*  Yesterday I said it, and today I repeat it.
*  Marielle's biggest legacy to the country is the evidence that women, black people who
*  live in slums, when they get to positions, they deserve to remain alive.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, War, Peace and the Presidency.
