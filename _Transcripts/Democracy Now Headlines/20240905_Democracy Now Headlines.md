# Top U.S. & World Headlines — September 5, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v-SExbbDCI)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In the occupied West Bank, at least five Palestinians were killed today in an Israeli airstrike
*  on a car in the city of Tubas.
*  A six-Palestinian, 16-year-old Majed Fida Abu Zayna, was shot dead by Israeli forces
*  in the Fada refugee camp near Tubas.
*  The Wafa news agency reports Israeli forces barred ambulances from reaching the boy and
*  dragged his body out of the camp using a military bulldozer.
*  On Wednesday, mourners held a funeral procession near Jenin for a Palestinian girl killed by
*  an Israeli sniper.
*  This is the girl, Lujain's father, Osama Musleh.
*  The soldiers are surrounding the town.
*  I tried to save her.
*  I tried to do something, but I couldn't.
*  The army is surrounding our area.
*  I called for an ambulance.
*  They arrived late because a sniper shot towards them.
*  She was 16 years old.
*  The only thing she did is she looked from the window, and the soldiers saw her and shot
*  her.
*  One bullet that targeted her forehead.
*  At least 19 people have been killed in Jenin since last week, when Israel launched its
*  largest West Bank offensive in two decades.
*  Jenin's governor, Kamal Abu al-Rab, said Israeli armored bulldozers have raised 70
*  percent of Jenin's streets, destroying more than a dozen miles of water and sewage pipes,
*  along with electrical and communication cables.
*  Jenin's main public hospital has been locked down, and 4,000 Jenin residents have been
*  forced from their homes at gunpoint.
*  The situation in the areas which are under siege is bad.
*  The Israeli army is preventing food, water, ambulances and journalists from reaching these
*  besieged areas, so we don't know what is happening in the areas which they consider
*  to be military closed areas.
*  We are getting lots of calls for help.
*  This invasion is the worst, largest and most painful to Palestinian people because the
*  Israeli army is destroying the infrastructure, which means a blow to the local economy in
*  Jenin.
*  In the Gaza Strip, Israeli attacks have killed at least 18 Palestinians since Wednesday.
*  A tent encampment for displaced Palestinians killed four people near Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital
*  in central Gaza.
*  The strike destroyed dozens of tents, wounded many others, including children.
*  In southern Gaza, medical workers have begun vaccinating tens of thousands of Palestinian
*  children in the city of Hanunis against polio, the second stage of a U.N.-led polio eradication
*  effort.
*  Meanwhile, Hamas has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of deliberately
*  undermining efforts to forge a ceasefire and hostage release deal by refusing to withdraw
*  Israeli troops from the Philadelphia corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt.
*  This comes as newly published documents show how Netanyahu and Israeli negotiators purposefully
*  prolonged Israel's assault on Gaza by making new demands during ceasefire talks.
*  The documents, published by the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Aranof, also reveal three of the six
*  hostages found dead in Gaza last weekend were due for release under a ceasefire agreement
*  drafted in May.
*  President Biden said Monday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not doing enough
*  to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal.
*  On Tuesday, a group of more than two dozen rights organizations, including Amnesty International
*  and Refugees International, sent the Biden-Harris administration a letter highlighting, quote,
*  The Portland City Council in Maine unanimously voted to divest all funds from companies complicit
*  in Israeli human rights violations and war crimes against Palestinians.
*  Organizers say Portland is the fourth U.S. city and the first on the East Coast to adopt
*  such a divestment resolution, which comes after intense campaigning from rights groups
*  including Maine Coalition for Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace Maine.
*  Metta has ruled the phrase from the River to the Sea is not hate speech.
*  Pro-Israel groups have accused people who used the longstanding rallying cry for Palestinian
*  liberation of being anti-Semitic and attempted to shut down speech promoting Palestinian
*  rights on social media.
*  Metta's oversight board, ruled from the River to the Sea, is, quote, often used as
*  a political call for solidarity, equal rights and self-determination of the Palestinian
*  people and to end the war in Gaza, unquote.
*  In Georgia, a 14-year-old boy shot and killed two other 14-year-olds and two students at
*  Apalachee High School in the city of Winder on Wednesday morning.
*  In the deadliest school shooting this year, at least nine others were injured.
*  Authorities said Colt Gray, who used an AR platform-style weapon in Wednesday's rampage,
*  will stand murder charges as an adult.
*  This is 15-year-old student Itzel Navarrete, who survived the shooting.
*  All of us, including me, I was crying, I was shaking.
*  I just didn't know where my mind was.
*  I was just so scared.
*  Yeah, a lot of us were just crying.
*  All you hear is crying.
*  All you hear is the sirens from outside.
*  So it made us even more scared because we were like, oh, it's real, it's real.
*  We didn't know how to react.
*  The shooter killed two students and two teachers.
*  The teenage suspect was on the FBI's radar as far back as May of 2023, was interviewed
*  when he was 13 years old, along with his father, about anonymous online threats.
*  His father said he kept hunting guns in the family home.
*  Appalachee High School reportedly received a threat by phone ahead of the shooting, with
*  the caller warning five schools would be targeted starting with Appalachee, after headlines
*  will go to Georgia for the latest.
*  In Britain, Prime Minister Keir Starmer issued an apology Wednesday as the results of a seven-year-long
*  investigation into the Grenfell Tower fire concluded the disaster was avoidable and was
*  caused by decades of failure by the U.K. government and systematic dishonesty of the companies
*  that provided insulation and other construction materials in the London Tower block.
*  The fire killed 72 people, many of them children, most of them from low-income and immigrant
*  families.
*  This is Natasha Elcock, a survivor and spokesperson for the group Grenfell United.
*  We paid the price of systematic dishonesty, institutional indifference and neglect.
*  Today, we send a message to Keir Starmer and his government.
*  This country has been failed by governments of all political persuasion.
*  Our expectation is your government will break old habits and implement all the recommendations
*  made by Sir Martin Morbic's report without further delay.
*  Because the time to address this is already three decades too late.
*  Go to democracynow.org to see our interview with a Grenfell survivor.
*  In Germany, the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AFD, party won an election in
*  the eastern state of Thuringia and came in second in neighboring Saxony, sending shockwaves
*  throughout Germany and Europe.
*  It's unlikely the AFD will be able to form a ruling coalition as other parties refuse
*  to work with them, and Chancellor Olaf Scholz has called on German lawmakers to lock the
*  nationalist party out of any talks.
*  Alice Weidel is co-leader of Alternative for Germany.
*  Our school classes are being flooded with children and young people from foreign cultures
*  who come from archaic backgrounds marked by Muslim beliefs.
*  They are uneducated and all they speak is gibberish.
*  Children no longer learn anything, and this is the result as to why those young people
*  who still want to have a perspective in our country have supported the AFD as much as
*  they have.
*  This is the first time a far-right party has won a German election since the 1930s.
*  In 1930, the Nazi party won Thuringia State.
*  Three years later, Adolf Hitler became Germany's chancellor.
*  In other news from Germany, Munich police officers shot and killed a man near the Israeli
*  consulate and Nazi documentation center earlier today after he opened fire on police officers.
*  Meanwhile, in news from France, President Emmanuel Macron has named former EU Brexit
*  negotiator Michel Barnier as France's new prime minister after rejecting calls to appoint a
*  progressive leader following a victory by a leftist coalition in July's snap elections.
*  Barnier is a long-time conservative from the Les Républicains party.
*  Back in the United States, President Biden could make his current hardline border restrictions
*  permanent, according to administration officials.
*  In June, Biden issued a temporary executive order sealing off the border when the number of asylum
*  seekers exceeds a daily average of 2,500 for one week and allowing border agents to quickly
*  turn away migrants.
*  The asylum ban being considered would make the executive order a permanent feature of
*  U.S. immigration policy and further lower the threshold at which migrants are rejected.
*  The ACLU and others have sued Biden over the policy.
*  In campaign news, Kamala Harris has agreed to propose rules for her ABC News debate with
*  Donald Trump September 10th, including having mics muted when a candidate has not been given
*  the floor, although Harris's team said it would disadvantage her.
*  And in other campaign news, Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congressmember who served in
*  the House Republican leadership and voted to impeach Trump, has endorsed Kamala Harris
*  for president.
*  Those are some of the headlines.
