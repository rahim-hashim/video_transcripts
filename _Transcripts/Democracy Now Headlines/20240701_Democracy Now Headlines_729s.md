# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” July 1, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [July 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iFM0wYIJ4A)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In France, the far right is at the gates of power, after it won a significant lead in
*  the first round of snap parliamentary elections Sunday, a blow to President Emmanuel Macron's
*  ensemble alliance, which is polling third.
*  Marine Le Pen's anti-immigrant national rally bloc has so far clinched nearly 34 percent
*  of the vote, while the new Popular Front, a coalition formed by leftist parties, came
*  in a close second, with nearly 28 percent of the vote.
*  Sunday's election brought out the highest voter turnout in years, as young French voters
*  were urged to come out to defeat extremists.
*  Macron stunned the country, calling for the snap elections, following major losses in
*  European Parliament elections last month to the far-right NR Party.
*  After headlines, we'll go to Paris for the latest.
*  In the Gaza Strip, thousands of civilians remain trapped amidst heavy fighting in the
*  Gaza City district of Shijia, where Israeli tanks were seen advancing after another day
*  of brutal Israeli attacks.
*  Gaza's health ministry says at least 23 Palestinians were killed in the past day alone, bringing
*  the death toll since the start of Israel's latest assault on Gaza to more than 37,900.
*  In Gaza's Deraa Bala neighborhood, survivors of an Israeli airstrike gathered at the Al-Aqsa
*  Martyrs Hospital Saturday to mourn the dead.
*  This is 10-year-old Bilal Abu Hassanian, whose family home was bombed by Israel last week.
*  I went to check out our rooftop, and they struck us.
*  I was bombed.
*  I flew off the rooftop and fell.
*  When I fell, I was shattered.
*  My grandfather started screaming.
*  I went out to see what was happening.
*  My grandfather was telling us that our home was bombed.
*  When I heard the word bombed, I went to check the room where I had been sleeping.
*  I found out that my mother and brother had been martyred.
*  Meanwhile, the Palestinian government media office says another journalist has been killed
*  by Israeli forces in Gaza.
*  The 153rd such deadly attack has been reported since October.
*  Mohammed Mahmoud Abu Sharia died of wounds two days after an Israeli airstrike targeted
*  his home in the Sabra neighborhood of Gaza City.
*  In Israel, an estimated 130,000 protesters marched in Tel Aviv Saturday evening demanding
*  an immediate ceasefire deal in Gaza, a prisoner swap that would see all Israelis held hostage
*  by Hamas released, and the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his
*  government.
*  This is Snerdaan, whose cousin is being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.
*  The one thing standing between us and our loved ones is Netanyahu's stubborn insistence
*  to not end this war as a part of a deal.
*  The continuation of this war means the murder of the hostages by Israeli government.
*  The blood is on your hands.
*  Meanwhile, thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jewish men held protests over the weekend after Israel's
*  high court lifted an exemption to mandatory military service for members of conservative
*  religious groups.
*  In Sudan, the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group claims it's captured the city of Sinja,
*  a key state capital in southeastern Sudan.
*  Tens of thousands of residents fled the city ahead of the RSF's advance.
*  Those who remain report RSF fighters have been seen widely looting homes and shops.
*  This week, the United Nations Hunger Monitor warned over 750,000 people in Sudan are facing
*  catastrophic levels of extreme hunger, while more than 8 million face food shortages that
*  could lead to malnutrition or even death.
*  Hurricane Beryl is making landfall on the Windward Islands, with meteorologists warning
*  the Category 3 storm will bring life-threatening winds and storm surge across southeastern
*  Caribbean nations.
*  Hurricane warnings were issued in Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenadine Islands,
*  Granada and Tobago.
*  Over the weekend, Beryl reached Category 4 status, becoming the earliest such Atlantic
*  hurricane on record.
*  It's being fueled by an unprecedented ocean heatwave driven by the climate crisis.
*  The U.S. Supreme Court's conservative supermajority has struck down four decades of precedent,
*  which established that judges should defer to federal agencies on interpreting a law
*  if Congress did not specifically address the issue.
*  On Friday, justices ruled 6-3 to overturn the legal precedent known as the Chevron
*  Doctrine.
*  Critics called the court's ruling a major power grab by corporate interests.
*  Justice Elena Kagan wrote in dissent, quote,
*  "...in every sphere of current or future federal regulation, expect courts from now
*  on to play a commanding role.
*  It's not a role Congress has given them.
*  It's a role this court has now claimed for itself, as well as other judges."
*  Unquote.
*  In another 6-3 ruling on Friday, justices ruled local governments can criminalize sleeping
*  and camping and public property, banning encampments of unhoused people.
*  In a scathing dissent joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote
*  for the minority, quote,
*  "...sleep is a biological necessity, not a crime.
*  For some people, sleeping outside is their only option.
*  For people with no access to shelter, that punishes them for being homeless.
*  That's unconscionable and unconstitutional," they said.
*  We'll have more on the Supreme Court's rulings later in the broadcast.
*  President Trump's former top political adviser is reporting to a federal prison today after
*  he was found guilty of contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas related to the January
*  6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.
*  Steve Bannon is set to begin a four-month sentence after the Supreme Court declined
*  Bannon's request that it intervene.
*  Top congressional Republicans, led by House Speaker Mike Johnson, filed an amicus brief
*  on Bannon's behalf, asking the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to keep him out of jail.
*  Bannon still faces criminal charges in New York for allegedly defrauding donors to an
*  anti-immigrant nonprofit called We Build the Wall, out of more than $15 million and for
*  laundering the proceeds.
*  Democratic leaders are defending President Biden after his disastrous debate against
*  Donald Trump last week, when Biden appeared halting, disjointed and often seemed to lose
*  his train of thought.
*  Prominent Democrats rejecting calls for the president to step aside include Biden's
*  surrogates, Senators Raphael Warnock and Chris Coons, Congressmember Jim Clyburn and Maryland
*  Governor Wes Moore.
*  Democratic strategist David Axelrod wrote, quote,
*  "'Unless the president himself decides to quit, which he won't, that issue is settled,'
*  unquote.
*  Here comes as a new CBS News poll finds 72 percent of registered U.S. voters believe
*  Biden does not possess the mental and cognitive health required to be president.
*  On Friday, the New York Times editorial board published an editorial titled, To Serve His
*  Country, President Biden Should Leave the Race.
*  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's editorial board similarly called on Biden to bow out.
*  Meanwhile, Maryland Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin told MSNBC there are conversations
*  among top Democrats about nominating someone other than Joe Biden at the Democratic National
*  Convention in August.
*  We're having a serious conversation about what to do.
*  One thing I can tell you is that regardless of what President Biden decides, our party
*  is going to be unified and our party also needs him at the very center of our deliberations
*  and our campaign.
*  And so whether he's the candidate or someone else is the candidate, he is going to be the
*  keynote speaker at our convention.
*  In Iran, reformist candidate Masoud Pesachian will face off against conservative Saeed Jalili
*  in a runoff election set for July 5th, after neither candidate received enough votes in
*  a weekend poll to win the presidency outright.
*  Fewer than 25 million Iranians voted in the contest to replace former President Ibrahim
*  Raissi, who died in a helicopter crash in May.
*  That's just 40 percent of eligible voters, the lowest turnout in any Iranian election
*  since the 1979 revolution.
*  Millions of people took to the streets of cities across the globe over the weekend to
*  celebrate LGBTQ plus pride events.
*  In Bogota, Colombia, thousands of pride participants marched against so-called conversion therapy,
*  which aims to change a person's sexuality through interventions.
*  A bill under consideration in Colombia's legislature would ban the practice, which
*  has been described by a U.N. expert on sexual orientation as torture.
*  In the Republic of Georgia, lawmakers have granted initial approval to several bills
*  cracking down on LGBTQ plus rights, including bans on the so-called propaganda of same-sex
*  relationships, gender reassignment surgery and even the display of rainbow flags.
*  The bill is mirror anti-LGBTQ legislation passed by Russia.
*  This is Tamar Jakeli, director of Tbilisi Pride in Georgia's capital city.
*  Pride march or pride events could no longer be held legally.
*  So even though in the past practically we had difficulties holding this, now it's
*  going to be illegal.
*  And basically, if I want to hold a pride march or any demonstration, in fact, about LGBT
*  rights, at first I will get fined and then I might even face charges like to go to prison.
*  Here in the United States, President Biden's pardoned thousands of U.S. military veterans
*  convicted under laws banning gay sex under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
*  In a separate declaration, Biden described the anti-LGBTQ lavender scare that began in
*  the 1950s as a, quote, shameful chapter in our nation's history, unquote.
*  The White House says up to 10,000 LGBTQ plus federal employees were investigated and lost
*  their jobs simply because of who they were and whom they loved.
*  On Friday, President Biden flew to New York City where he spoke at the opening ceremony
*  of the newly constructed Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center.
*  The memorial is built on the site of a gay and trans-friendly bar called the Stonewall
*  Inn, which was raided by New York City police June 28, 1969.
*  As officers began dragging some of the patrons out at the time, the community, led largely
*  by trans women, fought back, sparking three days of rioting and resistance that launched
*  the modern day LGBTQ movement.
*  This is President Biden.
*  Fifty-five years ago today on this hallowed ground, a pivotal story for our nation unfolded.
*  The soul of the nation was literally tested.
*  That's not hyperbole.
*  The soul of the nation was tested.
*  And the heart of this movement was ignited.
*  And the course of history has changed forever.
*  Not just here, but I traveled around the world.
*  They looked at us.
*  They looked at us as part of our foreign policy as well now.
*  As Biden addressed the Stonewall National Monument's grand opening,
*  queer and trans activists held protests unfurling banners reading,
*  Queers to Biden Stop Arming Israel and From New York to Gaza, Stonewall was an Intifada,
*  Stonewall veteran and legendary trans activist Miss Major Griffin Gracie said in a statement,
*  quote, Stonewall was about kicking the cops out of our lives.
*  Biden can't come here and pretend to support us while he drops bombs on people in Gaza.
*  The girls and guys will keep on fighting, chanting, marching till every damn person is free,
*  including Palestinians, they said.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
