# Top U.S. & World Headlines — September 9, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [September 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUAFHPXbiuM)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel's war on Gaza has entered its 12th month, as the official death toll nears 41,000,
*  though that's believed to be a vast undercount.
*  Israel killed at least eight Palestinians Saturday in an airstrike on a school housing
*  displaced people in the Jubalya refugee camp.
*  Meanwhile, the U.N. special rapporteur on the right to food, Michael Fakhry, has accused
*  Israel of carrying out a starvation campaign in Gaza.
*  The World Food Program warns some 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza remain in urgent need
*  of food and humanitarian aid.
*  And the Occupied West Bank of Funeral is being held today for the Turkish-American activist
*  Ayeshanur Ezgi Aygi, who was shot dead Friday by Israeli forces.
*  She was a 26-year-old recent graduate of the University of Washington who was volunteering
*  with the International Solidarity Movement.
*  She was shot while taking part in a weekly protest against illegal Israeli settlements
*  in the town of Bethe.
*  The Israeli activist Jonathan Palak witnessed the shooting.
*  By the time this had happened, it was completely quiet here.
*  We were standing for 10, 15 minutes without anything happening.
*  The reason why no one was filming is because it was completely quiet.
*  And then, all of a sudden, two shots.
*  And the sniper or the soldier that was there took a kill shot.
*  Jonathan Palak held Ayeshanur as she lay dying.
*  We'll have more on this story after headlines.
*  Meanwhile, Israeli troops are also accused of fatally shooting a 13-year-old Palestinian
*  girl named Bana Laboum.
*  She was hit by a bullet while inside her own home in the village of Qayyut, which had been
*  attacked by Israeli settlers.
*  Bana's mom spoke out after her daughter was killed.
*  She was in her room, along with her sisters.
*  She was afraid, in fear.
*  And suddenly, a bullet got in through the window and hit her while she was on her bed.
*  This is what happened.
*  There were scuffles outside with the youth, but we were surprised that a bullet came through
*  the window and on to her.
*  As many as 750,000 Israelis took to the streets Saturday in Tel Aviv and other cities calling
*  for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal in what's been described as one of the largest protests
*  in Israeli history.
*  This is Zahir Osharmur, whose uncle, Abraham Mandar, died in captivity in Gaza.
*  As long as Netanyahu remains in power, we will keep getting hostages back in body bags.
*  Netanyahu must be removed from power in order to save the lives of the hostages and the
*  country itself.
*  A Jordanian truck driver shot dead three Israeli security guards at a border crossing between
*  the occupied West Bank and Jordan Sunday.
*  Israel responded by temporarily closing all border crossings with Jordan.
*  Pedestrian traffic has resumed on the Allen B Bridge, the site of the shooting.
*  Three Lebanese paramedics were killed and two were injured Saturday in an Israeli attack
*  on southern Lebanon.
*  The Lebanese government said the paramedics were killed as they were responding to fire
*  sparked by recent Israeli airstrikes.
*  In related news, Israel is accused of attacking Syria overnight, killing at least 16 people
*  in Hama province.
*  Another 36 people were wounded.
*  Donald Trump's sentencing in his Hush Money election interference case has been pushed
*  back until November 26, weeks after the presidential election.
*  New York Judge Juan Marchand made the ruling on Friday.
*  On the same day, Trump appeared in a different New York courtroom as his lawyers attempted
*  to overturn his sexual abuse conviction in the E. Jean Carroll case.
*  Donald Trump later held a news conference where he assailed Carroll and another woman,
*  Jessica Leeds, who had accused him of sexual misconduct on a plane.
*  It couldn't have happened.
*  It didn't happen.
*  And she would not have been the chosen one.
*  She would not have been the chosen one.
*  To see our interviews with Jessica Leeds, you can go to democracynow.org.
*  On Saturday, Donald Trump also posted a message on social media threatening to jail opponents
*  if he wins re-election.
*  He wrote, quote,
*  "'When I win, those people that cheated will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the
*  law, which will include long-term prison sentences so that the depravity of justice does not
*  happen again.
*  Please beware that this legal exposure extends to lawyers, political operatives, donors,
*  illegal voters and corrupt election officials,' Trump wrote.
*  This all comes as Trump prepares for Tuesday's debate against Kamala Harris.
*  Sudan's warring parties rejected a call by U.N. experts to deploy an international
*  force to protect civilians from the devastating civil war which erupted last April.
*  A U.N. fact-finding mission reported harrowing human rights abuses committed by both Sudanese
*  and the paramilitary rapid support forces.
*  The World Health Organization's Tejras Adnan Gebreyesus visited Port Sudan over the weekend.
*  TEJRAS ADNAN GEBREYEYSUS, World Health Organization's Tejras Adnan Gebreyesus
*  According to available data, Sudan's conflict has so far killed more than 20,000 people.
*  This is an underestimate, by the way.
*  Displaced over 10 million people inside the country and forced another 2 million to flee
*  to neighboring countries.
*  This is the largest internal displacement of people in the world today.
*  The scale of the emergency is shocking, and as is the insufficient action being taken
*  to curtail the conflict and respond to the suffering it's causing.
*  This comes as new video has emerged from Sudan showing the aftermath of an ethnically motivated
*  massacre by RSF fighters in Darfur's Qassab Cap in the town of Khotoum last year.
*  The attack killed an estimated 73 people.
*  The RSF have been accused of many other deadly attacks on black Sudanese communities.
*  In France, tens of thousands of people took to the streets Saturday to protest President
*  Emmanuel Macron's appointment of conservative Michel Barnier as the new prime minister.
*  Leftist parties, which won the most votes in July's snap parliamentary elections,
*  accuse Macron of stealing the election.
*  This is Benjamin Lucas, deputy from the leftist New Popular Front coalition.
*  By appointing Michel Barnier, the president of the French Republic has decided to spit
*  in the face of the millions of French people who turned out on July 7 to vote in a historic
*  election.
*  The question before us was whether or not we wanted the extreme right to win in this
*  country.
*  The French said no.
*  There was a massive turnout, the highest since 1981.
*  The message was clear.
*  We don't want the extreme right and power.
*  Venezuela's former opposition presidential candidate, Mundo González, has fled to Spain
*  to seek asylum after spending weeks in hiding.
*  González was facing arrest in Venezuela after he accused President Nicolas Maduro of stealing
*  the July election.
*  Venezuela's Supreme Court certified Maduro's victory, but many countries, including the
*  United States, have claimed González won.
*  Pope Francis has arrived in East Timor, becoming the first pope to visit the largely Catholic
*  country since it gained independence in 2002.
*  More than half of East Timor's population of 1.3 million people are expected to attend
*  an open-air mass on Tuesday.
*  The Timorese government has faced backlash for spending $12 million on the papal visit
*  and for bulldozing the homes of many poor families ahead of the pope's visit.
*  A group of Timorese groups have called on Pope Francis to address the history of sexual
*  abuse by priests in Timor-Leste.
*  In Vietnam, at least 59 people were killed as Typhoon Yagi triggered massive floods and
*  landslides, a major bridge collapsed and a bus was seen being swept away and floodwater
*  is still in the air.
*  This is a resident of the port city of Haiphong.
*  The damage done to this community is extremely severe.
*  Most of the roof was blown away or the ceiling caved in.
*  It may take three or four years for this place to look the same again, because the damage
*  is so terrible.
*  The surroundings look like an apocalypse day.
*  Never before has a storm dealt this much damage to us.
*  Typhoon Yagi killed at least 20 people in the Philippines and four in southern China
*  last week, climate changes making extreme weather events like typhoons more frequent
*  and deadlier.
*  Boeing has reached a tentative deal with over 30,000 workers in the Pacific Northwest ahead
*  of a possible strike Friday.
*  The deal includes a 25 percent pay raise, better retirement and health benefits, pledging
*  to build its next commercial aircraft in the Seattle area and giving the union more say
*  in safety and quality issues.
*  And Miami police have launched an investigation after officers stopped and detained Miami
*  Dolphins star Tariq Hill as he drove to Sunday's game.
*  An officer handcuffed and placed Hill face down on the street just outside the football
*  team's stadium.
*  Police also handcuffed Hill's teammate, Kalei Campbell, who said he was trying to de-escalate
*  the situation.
*  Both men are black.
*  After the players were released, Hill scored a touchdown to help the Dolphins win.
*  During the touchdown celebration, a teammate pretended to handcuff Tariq Hill in the end
*  zone.
*  Tariq Hill spoke to reporters after the game.
*  I still don't know what happened.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  But I do want to say, I do want to be able to use this platform to say, like, what if
*  I wasn't Tyriq Hill, bro?
*  Like, worst-case scenario, you know, because it's crazy.
*  One Miami police officer involved in the incident has been placed on administrative leave.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
