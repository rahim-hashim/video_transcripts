Israel has launched a large-scale military attack on Iran, killing top military officials, nuclear scientists and civilians in the deadliest attack on the country in decades. Iran has launched drones at Israel in response. The unprovoked attack, which Israel described as a "preemptive strike," comes just days before scheduled nuclear talks between Iran and the United States. Iranian-born analyst Trita Parsi says the Trump administration appears to have been coordinating with Israel for "negotiating leverage" in an attempt to force Iran to "capitulate" on nuclear disarmament. Whether this gambit will succeed remains to be seen, though Parsi and Israeli journalist Gideon Levy say Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is betting it does not. Netanyahu has long indicated a willingness to wage war with Iran and likely hopes to draw the United States into a major regional conflict. "This was the project of his life," says Levy.

*  Trump posted on social media, quote, I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=103.26s)]

*  new nuclear agreement. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=114.0s)]

*  Obama, Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=139.42s)]
*  Welcome back to both of you on Democracy Now! [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=143.34s)]
*  Treeta, let's begin with you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=146.42s)]
*  Your response to these extraordinary attacks by Israel on Iran. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=148.46s)]
*  So far, it clearly seems that the Israelis have been successful in achieving early stages [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=155.5s)]
*  of what they want, which is to take out much of Iran's command and having killed several [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=160.96s)]
*  senior military officials. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=167.01999999999998s)]
*  When it comes to damage to the nuclear program, the attacks against Natanz are one thing, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=169.18s)]
*  and that's a facility that is no more than 10, 20 meters underground. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=175.9s)]
*  There's not been any attacks against Fordow, which is about 800 meters underground, and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=179.06s)]
*  that is something that it does not appear that the Israelis have the military capacity [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=183.74s)]
*  to take out through bombardment, and maybe other avenues that they will pursue. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=188.18s)]
*  And perhaps even the U.S. does not. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=193.26000000000002s)]
*  But what I think is increasingly clear in all of this is that this was not an act of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=195.22s)]
*  defiance by Netanyahu against Trump, but rather the Trump administration and Trump himself [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  was coordinating this with the Israelis in the hope, apparently, for Trump, thinking [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=205.78s)]
*  that this will actually soften the Iranian negotiating position and enable him to get [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=211.32s)]
*  a deal in which the Iranians capitulate. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=216.38s)]
*  It remains to be seen whether that is the case. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=218.94s)]
*  I suspect that the Israeli hope, however, is that the Iranians don't capitulate, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=220.82s)]
*  that they strike back and by that get the U.S. to get more actively involved in the war. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=224.66s)]
*  So, Trita, can you talk about the significance of who has been killed? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  So, you know, several of the top people, the head of the Air Force, the head of the missile [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=240.22s)]
*  program, the former head of the nuclear program, several of their predecessors had also been [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=246.22s)]
*  killed in assassinations by the Israelis, none of them at this scale and at the same [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=251.66s)]
*  time. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=257.46s)]
*  And this, at a minimum, is going to delay an Iranian response to Israel because so much [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=258.78s)]
*  of the top command essentially is gone. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=264.65999999999997s)]
*  Whether they can actually reconstitute it remains to be seen. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=267.42s)]
*  But in that sense, the Israelis have pursued exactly the same game plan that they had with [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=272.12s)]
*  Hezbollah, and it appears that the Iranians have learned nothing from that, because that's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=277.38s)]
*  what the Israelis did in Lebanon. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=281.46000000000004s)]
*  They went after the top ranks and by that they made sure that much rest of the organization [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=282.94s)]
*  was not capable of striking back or fighting. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=287.74s)]
*  And once that happened, the Israelis intensified their bombings, which is probably what will [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=291.5s)]
*  happen in this case as well. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=295.62s)]
*  Once they feel that the Iranians are essentially incapable of responding, they're going to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=297.42s)]
*  do everything they can to take out as much as possible of Iran's military capabilities, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=301.42s)]
*  conventional or nuclear. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=305.58000000000004s)]
*  So, you have this tweet of President Trump this morning where he says, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=309.02s)]
*  "'Two months ago, I gave you two months.'" [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=314.82s)]
*  If you can talk about what's going on at the negotiation level, the fact that the negotiations [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=318.94s)]
*  were supposed to be continuing on Sunday, will that be happening? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=324.82s)]
*  And the level of infiltration of Iran by Israel, what this means to hit so many, to kill so [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=329.54s)]
*  many of the top leadership in Iran, not to mention if you can talk about the significance [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=338.1s)]
*  of Natanz and these other nuclear and military sites that have been hit. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=343.7s)]
*  Well, the significance of what has happened at the negotiating table is that originally [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=350.02000000000004s)]
*  the Trump administration entered these talks with the red line of only seeking no weaponization. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=356.3s)]
*  And with that red line, a deal could be made, because it would mean restricting the Iranian [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=362.46000000000004s)]
*  nuclear program, but not eliminating it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=366.18s)]
*  The Iranians have agreed to that in the past. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=368.26s)]
*  They have signaled clearly that they would agree to it again. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=370.3s)]
*  Something happened, though, and Trump then shifted his position towards zero enrichment, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=374.02s)]
*  which is the Israeli position, the same position that John Bolton and Mike Pompeo argued for [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=377.86s)]
*  in the previous Trump administration. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=382.62s)]
*  This then caused a deadlock in the negotiations, predictably, and it appears that that then [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=384.72s)]
*  opened up the pathway for the Israelis to convince Trump that what he needs to do is [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=389.62s)]
*  to allow Israel to go in militarily with the help of the United States in order to essentially [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=394.34s)]
*  soften the Iranian negotiating position. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=400.38s)]
*  I doubt that there will be any talks on Sunday. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=404.5s)]
*  I think the Israeli calculation is to hope that there won't be any negotiations going [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=406.62s)]
*  forward at all. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=410.09999999999997s)]
*  The Iranians respond, and then by that, making sure that the U.S. enters the war much more [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=411.09999999999997s)]
*  fully and openly than what it has been so far. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=415.82s)]
*  Well, Gideon Levy, we're speaking to you in Tel Aviv. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=418.3s)]
*  If you could tell us, you know, what the mood is there. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=421.86s)]
*  Israel, a state of emergency, has been declared in Israel. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=425.3s)]
*  Additional attacks from Iran are anticipated. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=430.74s)]
*  What is happening there? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=434.58000000000004s)]
*  What are you hearing? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=435.68s)]
*  It's a very intensive emotional mixture. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=436.86s)]
*  On one hand, there is the fatigue of the last 20 months in which Israel is attacking Gaza [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=445.14s)]
*  on a daily basis and many soldiers are there. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=450.38000000000005s)]
*  The war against Hezbollah in the north, people are sick and tired. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=454.18s)]
*  On the other hand, the James Bond sentiment wakes up now to see all those military impressive [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=459.06s)]
*  achievements. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=467.70000000000005s)]
*  Nobody can deny those are impressive military achievements. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=468.70000000000005s)]
*  And this gives some pride to Israelis. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=472.94000000000005s)]
*  Israelis like it very much. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=477.54s)]
*  As you know, quite a militaristic society and those achievements killing here and destroying [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=479.66s)]
*  there without any casualties, obviously, until now, it's a great achievement. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=486.34000000000003s)]
*  But nobody pays attention to the price, the potential price, the possible price, which [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=492.42s)]
*  none of us know what will it be. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=498.02s)]
*  And above all, there is no very clear answer. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=500.74s)]
*  Where are we aiming to? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=503.74s)]
*  Will we bomb every second year another location somewhere in the Middle East? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=505.26s)]
*  And by this, Israel will continue with the same policy, the same strategy, living with [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=511.09999999999997s)]
*  the sword forever? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=517.46s)]
*  Can't tell you. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=519.98s)]
*  But right now, people are very proud of what happened and very worried from the retaliation, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=520.98s)]
*  which might come any moment. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=527.26s)]
*  And Gideon, what about your response? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=529.26s)]
*  There's been some speculation that these attacks, and indeed the success of these attacks, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=533.4599999999999s)]
*  in terms of hitting the targets that were presumably chosen, that this will actually [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=540.66s)]
*  bolster Netanyahu's position within Israel in a way that now whatever support for him [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=546.18s)]
*  was dwindling because of his—you know, the continuing assault on Gaza and the Israeli [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=553.42s)]
*  hostages not having been released, all of them. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=560.6999999999999s)]
*  You see, we are in a very, very early and preliminary stage. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=565.06s)]
*  What looks now as a phenomenal success might turn into a fiasco within hours or days or [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=570.06s)]
*  weeks or months. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=579.26s)]
*  But right now, I'm sure that Netanyahu is much more appreciated than yesterday in Israeli [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=581.14s)]
*  society. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=587.9s)]
*  I give him the credit. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=589.1s)]
*  He didn't do it only for domestic politics. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=590.6999999999999s)]
*  This will be unfair to say. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=593.18s)]
*  His rivals are many, and I'm one of them, obviously. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=596.18s)]
*  But this was the project of his life in the last 20 years, and now he really implemented [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=599.5799999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=606.02s)]
*  We should be very careful in judging it because, as I said, it's too early. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=607.02s)]
*  But obviously, right now, he is really at his peak in popularity, even though there [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=612.06s)]
*  were no polls yet. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=619.5s)]
*  But sure, what he had done until now will add him a lot of support in Israeli public [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=621.18s)]
*  opinion, no doubt about it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=627.2199999999999s)]
*  We're trying to determine, Treta, if the chief Iranian negotiator for the nuclear deal [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=632.2199999999999s)]
*  has been killed or severely injured. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=639.98s)]
*  We're talking about Ali Shamkhani. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=642.86s)]
*  It looks like he has been killed. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=645.62s)]
*  He was former head of the Iranian National Security Council. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=648.46s)]
*  Can you talk about the significance of this? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=652.22s)]
*  So he has been killed, as I understand it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=656.5s)]
*  He was not the chief negotiator, but he was the chief of the negotiating committee that [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=658.7800000000001s)]
*  was coordinating the negotiations between the negotiating team and the supreme leader's [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=663.5799999999999s)]
*  office. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=668.8199999999999s)]
*  He's a longstanding figure within the Iranian regime of Arab background, and the fact that [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=669.8199999999999s)]
*  he was targeted is also further indication that the Israelis were not trying to enhance [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=676.38s)]
*  the negotiations, but rather force either a capitulation or an Iranian response that [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=681.74s)]
*  would bring the United States into the war more fully. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=686.9s)]
*  What are the concerns you have about a wider regional war? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=692.58s)]
*  Well, the concern that existed before, of course, was that this would lead to a major [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=697.3000000000001s)]
*  escalation in the region, particularly if some Arab states were allowing the United [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=703.4200000000001s)]
*  States to use its bases to support the strikes against Iran, which then would likely lead [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=707.7s)]
*  to Iran striking those countries. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=713.1s)]
*  Oil prices would go up, flow of traffic through the Strait of Hormuz would go down dramatically, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=715.1s)]
*  and we would potentially see major destabilizations throughout the region. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=721.66s)]
*  It's not clear whether it's going to go in that direction, particularly if the Iranian [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=725.34s)]
*  ability to respond has been significantly limited by these strikes. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=729.46s)]
*  And again, we don't know yet, because the picture is not sufficiently clear. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=734.5s)]
*  At a minimum, it will delay a potential response, but it could also make sure that the response [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=739.78s)]
*  is not at all what it could have been or what many expected it would be, including inside [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=745.34s)]
*  the U.S. government earlier on. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=751.3399999999999s)]
*  And, Trita Parsi, you said earlier that the Iran-U.S. talks that are scheduled for this [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=753.3399999999999s)]
*  Sunday, June 15th, with Oman's foreign minister and U.S. mediator Stephen Witkoff, you don't [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=759.02s)]
*  expect them to go ahead, though indications from the Trump administration seem to be at [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=766.02s)]
*  the moment that they will go ahead. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=772.06s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=776.18s)]
*  Well, the Trump administration is saying that they want it to go ahead, but whether it goes [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=777.18s)]
*  ahead or not depends on whether the Iranians show up. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=780.66s)]
*  And again, I think the Trump administration is trying to use these strikes as essentially [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=783.66s)]
*  a negotiating leverage. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=788.14s)]
*  The question is if it will work out that way or if it actually will prompt the Iranians [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=789.9s)]
*  to significantly harden their position, potentially walk out of the NPT, kick out the inspectors [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=794.14s)]
*  and move towards weaponization. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=799.66s)]
*  There's a lot of different—the spectrum is quite wide there, but I suspect that it [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=801.34s)]
*  is quite unlikely that there will be any talks on Sunday. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=805.62s)]
*  And I also wonder where the Omanis are in all of this, because they probably feel a [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=809.2199999999999s)]
*  bit embarrassed, because they have done a very good faith effort to actually negotiate [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=813.18s)]
*  a deal. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=817.3399999999999s)]
*  But they agree to that mediation because of confidence that both sides are serious about [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=818.7399999999999s)]
*  a deal. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=823.38s)]
*  It's not so clear any longer as to whether the Omanis or anyone else would be serious [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=824.38s)]
*  about thinking that the administration actually is looking for a deal. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=828.66s)]
*  We finally—you told CNN earlier today that this would be catastrophic for Gaza, because [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=832.46s)]
*  now all the focus will shift to Iran and the starving, dying children of Gaza will be [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=839.62s)]
*  forgotten, if you could say a little more. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=844.7800000000001s)]
*  You emigrated me. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=849.2600000000001s)]
*  If you could say a little bit more, do you see that— [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=854.1400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, sure. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=856.7s)]
*  Sure, sure. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=857.7s)]
*  I didn't know you emigrated me. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=858.7s)]
*  Sure. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=859.7s)]
*  I was asked in CNN and other places, and I think this is very important, because the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=861.58s)]
*  world focus will now be only on Iran, and Gaza will be totally forgotten. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=867.58s)]
*  And Gaza is still a location of bloodbath, a terrible, terrible reality, as I don't have [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=874.7s)]
*  to tell you, viewers. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=882.82s)]
*  But this continues by the time we talk now. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=884.7s)]
*  There were over 100 people killed only in the last 24 hours in Gaza. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=887.42s)]
*  This will continue now, and if the world will focus only on Iran, this slaughter will continue [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=892.3399999999999s)]
*  day after day, and the suffer is unbearable, and we shouldn't forget Gaza, even though [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=899.66s)]
*  Iran is now the main focus. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=906.9s)]
*  But let's not forget Gaza, because Gaza is really starving and dying, and the suffer [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=909.66s)]
*  should stop at once. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=916.5s)]
*  I wish Donald Trump would be more involved in Gaza. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=918.38s)]
*  If Israel now has this success in Iran, at least stop the war in Gaza, at least make [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=921.74s)]
*  a ceasefire, without even any conditions, because the reality there is really inhuman, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=930.38s)]
*  criminal and unbearable, and we shouldn't forget Gaza. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMT1c2JHPQ4&t=937.58s)]
