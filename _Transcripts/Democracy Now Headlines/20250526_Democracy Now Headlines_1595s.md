*  Well, on May 31st, Marquez will lead an album release party concert with Keith Lamar joining [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=50.24s)]
*  from death row at Joe's Pub here in New York. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=58.04s)]
*  I recently spoke with Keith Lamar by phone about life on death row and the growing campaign [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  to save his life. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=69.36s)]
*  I asked him, what's it like to live on death row? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=70.88s)]
*  Well, I think the opposite word is lived on death row. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=75.2s)]
*  I've lived. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=79.8s)]
*  You know, early on when I first came here, I met and was metered by this older gentleman [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=80.8s)]
*  named Snoop. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=86.2s)]
*  He the one who turned me on to jazz. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  He the one who really introduced me to literature, serious books, books that ultimately changed [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=89.72s)]
*  my self-concept. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=96.4s)]
*  But this is a soul-crushing environment. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=97.4s)]
*  You see a lot of young people coming here without the means and resources to send off [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=104.72s)]
*  the ills, the ravages of being in this type of place, because sensibly deprivation, it [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=109.48s)]
*  robs you of your humanity. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=115.36s)]
*  And before long, you see these young guys unraveling. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=117.76s)]
*  So seeing that and being in proximity to that kind of pain has been really, really devastating. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=122.16s)]
*  But I share books. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=129.04s)]
*  I share my understanding and wisdom. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=130.04s)]
*  I'm familiar with the young people around me. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=133.04s)]
*  So I more or less work for this system, but in a proactive way, trying to help young people [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=135.96s)]
*  in the ways in which I myself was helped. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=143.96s)]
*  I am, you know, in possession of my property because other people helped me. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=147.28s)]
*  And so I try to extend that help and return. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=155.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=158.36s)]
*  But this is a soul-crushing environment, definitely. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=159.36s)]
*  Can you talk about the making of this film, explaining your case and what you're hoping [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=161.48s)]
*  to accomplish right now? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=170.8s)]
*  You have made this film. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=172.92s)]
*  You do live concerts that are performed around the world, remarkably, where you're joining [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=175.55999999999997s)]
*  from death row. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=182.11999999999998s)]
*  You have book clubs where your own book is read, but where you also lead in discussion [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=183.83999999999997s)]
*  of other books as well, with high schools and other places. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=190.56s)]
*  Talk about your message, Keith. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, I, you know, from the very beginning, just wanted to stand on my innocence. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=198.52s)]
*  You know, it was never really a matter of me not wanting to speak out, to stand up [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=205.4s)]
*  for myself. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  That was the whole point of me demanding the trial. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  But the whole system, I soon found out, is sitting around obedience, around operating [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=214.28s)]
*  within prescribed parameters and whatnot. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=219.12s)]
*  And I was advised to remain quiet during my trial and day after, and I did. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=222.36s)]
*  I went along with it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  That's what we do. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=232.84s)]
*  And other smarter, more learned people would speak on my behalf, would stand up and fight [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  for my life. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  And I believed that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  And I just kept going deeper and deeper into the darkness until I found myself in this [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  really, really desperate place where I was really standing on the brink of my existence. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=251.4s)]
*  You know, I had to find out the hard way that in order for my life to be mine, that I had [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=257.48s)]
*  to stand up and claim it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=261.8s)]
*  You know, so that was really the thing that was the catalyst that pushed me to start speaking [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=264.12s)]
*  up and reaching to utilize my own agency. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=269.8s)]
*  And all of these things that you just mentioned is a product of that general thrust, you know, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=273.48s)]
*  that thing that just comes to the conclusion that if I don't stand up right now, then I [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=278.91999999999996s)]
*  might lose my life. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=283.79999999999995s)]
*  And so that was the thing that kind of started the movie. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=286.84s)]
*  You know, I first started, I wrote the book, The Tremendous Condemned, and that was over [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  200 pages. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  And not long after that, a dear friend of mine, Lloyd Swain, produced a documentary, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=297.0s)]
*  which was 30 minutes. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=304.2s)]
*  And so we was trying to figure out a way to condense it even more because, you know, of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=306.04s)]
*  course, people have short attention spans. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=311.08000000000004s)]
*  We understand, I understand that people have their own problems, have their own lives to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=313.08000000000004s)]
*  live. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=317.48s)]
*  And so, you know, it's asking a lot to ask someone to sit down and read a 200-some page [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  book or a 30-minute documentary. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  But we thought that if we could condense the story into a seven-minute short, then possibly [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=324.92s)]
*  that could garner more attention. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  So that was the whole impetus behind creating the movie. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=332.84s)]
*  Keith Lamar, in your book Condemned, about Bobby Sands, if you can explain who he is, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=336.92s)]
*  his hunger strike, and how it inspired you to go on a hunger strike, which led to your [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=344.12s)]
*  case being known. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=348.84s)]
*  I mean, you've been written about in The New York Times. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  You have jazz greats playing with you, supporting your cause. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=352.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=357.72s)]
*  One of my friends who I think you might know named Stoughton Lynn was a famous historian, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=358.36s)]
*  social activist. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  He, in the beginning, when I was first sentenced to death, he somehow found his way into my [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  life. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=373.72s)]
*  And he sent me that book by Bobby Sands, Nothing But an Unfinished Song, written by Dennis [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=374.20000000000005s)]
*  O'Hern, who had since become a very close friend of mine. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=379.88000000000005s)]
*  He sent me that book. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=384.35999999999996s)]
*  And as I was reading it, it felt as if I was being sent a message. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=385.56s)]
*  If I had been pleading with these people, it's going on 18 years in a simple suit with [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=389.56s)]
*  eight years, all to no avail. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=396.28s)]
*  And I was reading this book, and it was almost a last-ditch effort before I was about to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=399.56s)]
*  give up. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=405.32s)]
*  And Bobby Sands, in his conrad, Bobby Sands, he was a great writer, a great writer, a great [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=406.35999999999996s)]
*  writer. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=414.36s)]
*  And Bobby Sands, for those who don't know, was an Irish prisoner who, along with several [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=414.76s)]
*  of his comrades, went on a hunger strike in Ireland. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=419.0s)]
*  And some of their demands were very basic, just to be treated as human beings, which, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=421.8s)]
*  of course, resonated with me. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=426.68s)]
*  And not long after I finished that book, I reached out to the author, Dennis O'Hern, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=428.68s)]
*  and I wrote him. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=434.2s)]
*  We struck up a correspondence. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=435.0s)]
*  He came to see me. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=436.68s)]
*  We became really close friends. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=437.88s)]
*  I decided to undergo an act of hunger strike myself, along with several other prisoners [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=439.96s)]
*  here at the supermax, went on hunger strike. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=446.52s)]
*  And after 18 years of not being able to break through court cases and all that, and 12 days [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=450.6s)]
*  of being on a hunger strike, I was sitting in the visitor room with my family. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=456.92s)]
*  And that was like a seminal moment in my journey. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=461.56s)]
*  It kind of taught me that if anything is going to change, you have to stand up and speak out, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=465.24s)]
*  you know, on your own. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=470.84s)]
*  And, you know, one of my literary heroes, Richard Wright, he wrote in his book Black Boy, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=471.88s)]
*  that if you speak out who you are, you will discover that you are not alone. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=477.48s)]
*  I wanted to bring in your lawyer, Keegan Stephane. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=482.36s)]
*  In one of Trump's first executive orders, January 20th, was to restore the death penalty, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=487.64s)]
*  Trump said, which includes the order that the attorney general ensures all states have [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=493.4s)]
*  necessary drugs. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=499.64s)]
*  This is Keith's second execution date. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=500.76s)]
*  What is it? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=503.56s)]
*  January 13th, 2027. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=504.12s)]
*  If you can explain what happens right now in court, where the case stands in court, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=506.67999999999995s)]
*  and the role of the Ohio governor, Mike DeWine, the position he has taken, since he, not Trump, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=515.16s)]
*  would decide what happens ultimately to Keith Lamar. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=521.64s)]
*  Yes, hi, Amy, and thanks for elevating Keith's case. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=528.28s)]
*  Keith, unfortunately, exhausted his direct appeals long ago. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=532.28s)]
*  The state courts and federal courts looked at his trial and determined, incorrectly, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=536.4399999999999s)]
*  that there were no constitutional deficiencies and upheld his conviction and his death sentence. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=541.48s)]
*  I do think that any fair-minded jurist looking at his trial now would deem it unconstitutional [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=546.5999999999999s)]
*  and overturn his convictions. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=553.88s)]
*  Unfortunately, the only way back into court is to find newly discovered evidence. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=555.7199999999999s)]
*  Me and a team of attorneys have been reviewing all the records in his case and talking to [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=559.9599999999999s)]
*  witnesses for the last two years, trying to turn up newly discovered evidence. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=563.64s)]
*  We have discovered a lot of new evidence supporting Keith's innocence. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=568.4399999999999s)]
*  I started as a skeptic. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=572.92s)]
*  I'm a prison abolitionist, definitely an abolitionist of the death penalty. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=574.68s)]
*  It doesn't matter to me if he's guilty. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=578.76s)]
*  He shouldn't be put to death. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=580.12s)]
*  But I can tell you, after looking at the record, talking to witnesses, there is no doubt in my [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=581.0799999999999s)]
*  mind that he is actually innocent. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=584.92s)]
*  Can you talk about your evolution in prison? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=586.52s)]
*  You went into prison, what, when you were 19 years old? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=591.0s)]
*  You hadn't graduated from high school. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=595.3199999999999s)]
*  Talk about going to school in prison. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=598.04s)]
*  Talk about every—you know, what happened? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=601.64s)]
*  What happened to you since? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=603.96s)]
*  Well, I dropped out in the 10th grade. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=607.72s)]
*  You know, I was dealing—living a hand-in-mouth existence, basically, when the crack [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=609.88s)]
*  epidemic exploded in Cleveland, Ohio around 1985, 86. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=614.0400000000001s)]
*  When I was around 16 years old or so, I had been living on my own for about a year or [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=618.52s)]
*  so at that time, and I got beat to be immersed in the job trade. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=623.96s)]
*  And when I came to prison, at the tragic events, we were already spoken about at my [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=627.48s)]
*  GED enrollment in college. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=636.6s)]
*  But that wasn't really the pivot. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=637.88s)]
*  The pivot happened when I started my own education. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=642.28s)]
*  The first series book I read was The Art of Art of the Field, Markham Maxx, and that was [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=647.64s)]
*  a pivot. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=651.56s)]
*  That was a real eye-opening thing. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=653.32s)]
*  I was constantly meeting these real individuals here in prison. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=655.9599999999999s)]
*  They mentor me, became father-sisters. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=662.68s)]
*  I joined the boxing team and met the guy who taught me how to play chess. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=664.76s)]
*  I met this guy who taught me how to write, you know, the difference between a semicolon [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=668.28s)]
*  and an independent clause. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=673.16s)]
*  I was learning all these things, things I didn't learn in school. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=674.4399999999999s)]
*  I learned these from other prisoners. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=677.64s)]
*  You know, that's the misconception that a lot of people have about people in prison, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=680.36s)]
*  that we are all animals and all these things, but these are just poor people. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=684.04s)]
*  Some of these poor people, when they arrive here, they want to try to understand why they [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=688.92s)]
*  are here. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=692.8399999999999s)]
*  I began that quest myself. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=694.68s)]
*  When I came to death row, all those things kind of—because I just went through this [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=699.64s)]
*  experience of the trial, which was nothing short of a mockery. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=704.68s)]
*  All the evidence was withheld. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=712.1999999999999s)]
*  22,000 pieces of evidence was burned, as I talk about in the movie. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=713.9599999999999s)]
*  All the conflicting statements that challenged the state's characterization of the facts [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=719.16s)]
*  was suppressed. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=725.24s)]
*  An all-white jury was impaneled. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=727.0s)]
*  And during the whole trial, the courtroom remained empty. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=728.76s)]
*  It was only when it was time to sentence me to death that people showed up. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=731.9599999999999s)]
*  So the community wasn't concerned about the evidence. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=735.3199999999999s)]
*  They were just concerned about the day in which they would be able to watch the lynching. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=738.2s)]
*  And it wasn't until months later, when I was already on death row, that I actually saw [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=742.6s)]
*  those famous lynching pictures that you see in books and whatnot. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=747.88s)]
*  And I knew it was something that I had just gone through. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=751.5600000000001s)]
*  And so that, along with my reading, I started reading James Baldwin, Richard Wright, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=755.32s)]
*  Charles Mills, Walter Rodney, C.R.R. James. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=760.6800000000001s)]
*  I started reading. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=766.44s)]
*  All these people became like active professors in my education, my maturation, and music. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=767.24s)]
*  My love for jazz grew simultaneously with my love of learning and reading and whatnot. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=779.0s)]
*  And I gradually found my way back to myself. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=787.8000000000001s)]
*  I achieved myself. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=792.36s)]
*  Had I taken a deal, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=793.8800000000001s)]
*  I would have died like something of a premature death, because I would have never realized who [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=795.96s)]
*  I am today. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=801.32s)]
*  And so I don't have regrets about making that hard decision, but it was ignorance that allowed [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=802.04s)]
*  me to do what I didn't know, what I didn't know about the system and how it functioned. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=807.64s)]
*  And thank God for that, because I probably would have taken the easy way out and missed [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=812.44s)]
*  the opportunity to find out who I was. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=817.64s)]
*  I want to bring back Keegan Stefan into this conversation. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=820.44s)]
*  Your lawyer, he's speaking to us from New York City. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=823.72s)]
*  You're on death row in Ohio State. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=826.28s)]
*  Keegan, if you could explain when Keith talks about taking the deal the first time and then [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=829.32s)]
*  the second time, saying he wanted to go to trial. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=838.52s)]
*  Explain how that—it's not him going into prison where he went right onto death row. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=842.9200000000001s)]
*  It's after the Lucasville uprising. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=849.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=853.7199999999999s)]
*  So Keith's original crime of conviction, as everyone heard, was for basically a self-defense [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=855.88s)]
*  killing. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=862.8399999999999s)]
*  When he was selling drugs, when he was very young, someone attempted to rob him. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=863.64s)]
*  He fought back. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=869.7199999999999s)]
*  They shot at him. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=870.52s)]
*  He shot back. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=871.24s)]
*  I think most people would deem that a self-defense killing, but under a legal doctrine [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=873.0799999999999s)]
*  called unclean hands, he couldn't apply that. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=877.72s)]
*  His counsel at the time encouraged him to plead guilty, and he did. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=880.36s)]
*  And then he was sent to Lucasville at a very unfortunate time, right before this uprising [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=884.44s)]
*  occurred. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=889.88s)]
*  And then these murders got pinned on him. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=890.84s)]
*  And then when he was being tried for those murders, he was offered a plea deal, which [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=895.24s)]
*  is a wild plea deal in retrospect, that he would have been given time that would have [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=901.48s)]
*  run concurrently with the sentence he was already serving for his original crime of [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=906.36s)]
*  conviction. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=910.52s)]
*  He would have effectively done no more time. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=911.0s)]
*  I mean, I think that's a very, very strong signal that they knew they had a weak case, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=912.92s)]
*  but they just wanted somebody to take the fall. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=917.48s)]
*  But Keith stood on his convictions and his innocence and said he wasn't going to do it. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=920.2s)]
*  He wasn't going to admit to murders he hadn't committed. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=925.64s)]
*  And that choice has made all the difference. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=929.64s)]
*  He was convicted despite a trial that was unfair on its face and then turned out to be even more [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=932.84s)]
*  unfair after all of the suppressed evidence came out. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=939.32s)]
*  As Keith mentioned, after trial, he learned that other people had admitted to some of the murders [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=943.08s)]
*  that he was convicted of committing, but those confessions weren't turned over in a usable form. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=949.88s)]
*  Many other people said, you know, who did the murders and didn't name Keith? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=956.36s)]
*  Those—that incredibly exculpatory evidence was not turned over in a usable form. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=961.16s)]
*  All of that was found and used on appeals, but his convictions were upheld in some very [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=966.76s)]
*  unjust decisions. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=973.0s)]
*  Now his only way back into court is through newly discovered evidence and another motion [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=974.4399999999999s)]
*  starting in the state court, which is going to take time to litigate, which is what his legal [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=979.16s)]
*  team, including myself, are working on now. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=983.48s)]
*  And of course, the death date is set for January 13th, 2027. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=985.96s)]
*  Keegan, can you talk about President Trump's executive order? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=992.1999999999999s)]
*  I think it was on the first day, on January 20th, where he tried to make sure the attorney general [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=997.16s)]
*  gets execution drugs to the states. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1002.84s)]
*  In fact, that's why Keith Lamar's first execution date was vacated, because Ohio didn't [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1005.48s)]
*  have the drugs to inject in him. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1012.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1016.04s)]
*  It's a horrifying executive order. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1016.92s)]
*  I think it exemplifies that the cruelness is the point of this administration. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1019.48s)]
*  Many drug companies are sort of uncomfortable providing the drugs that are used to [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1024.6s)]
*  affect executions in this country. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1032.28s)]
*  And for that reason, Ohio has been unable to execute people since Governor DeWine has [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1034.68s)]
*  taken office. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1039.32s)]
*  It's horrifying, and it may in fact enable Ohio to move forward with executions. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1040.12s)]
*  Which could likely make Keith's current execution date a very real execution date, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1046.3600000000001s)]
*  which is an absolutely terrifying prospect. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1050.44s)]
*  I've spent time with Keith on death row. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1053.0s)]
*  How do you live with the specter, Keith Lamar, over your head, the specter of death, that [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1055.0800000000002s)]
*  there is a date for you to die? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1062.0400000000002s)]
*  The test to your existence is daunting. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1066.2800000000002s)]
*  I don't even try to, you know, deny that. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1068.44s)]
*  But if I focus too much on it, Amy, it will immobilize me. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1072.44s)]
*  It will stop me or prevent me from doing the things that need to be done. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1078.2s)]
*  A lot of times when you see guys in my situation, you're very scared to hear from them directly. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1081.96s)]
*  There's always someone else speaking for them. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1087.24s)]
*  And sometimes that's because there's rules to prevent you from speaking on your behalf. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1089.16s)]
*  But we filed a lawsuit, and so I'm perfectly within my rights to do what I'm doing, to [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1094.04s)]
*  speak out for my life. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1099.3200000000002s)]
*  And I tend to do that. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1100.28s)]
*  You know, just thinking about what you just asked Keith about, the executive order. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1103.24s)]
*  And, you know, it's maddening. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1109.72s)]
*  When you think about, you know, here's a person who, you know, rants and raves about the injustice [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1113.56s)]
*  of the system when it relates to him personally. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1118.8400000000001s)]
*  And yet you see the overhaul that's going on where there's no awareness or connection to [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1122.44s)]
*  his own personal experience. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1127.56s)]
*  I mean, if he is to believe the system is corrupt, and yet the same person is armed [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1129.8000000000002s)]
*  in this very corrupt system to take other people's lives, human beings' lives. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1135.0800000000002s)]
*  But it's on par or other piece with everything else that flows from the system and where [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1139.0s)]
*  we are right now, the direction that we are moving in right now as a country. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1143.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, but me personally, you know, I have all these amazing people who are actually [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1147.64s)]
*  fighting with me, not for me, but with me. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1151.64s)]
*  And for that, I'm really, really, I'm truly grateful. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1154.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, I try not to dwell too much on, you know, the execution date, you know, because [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1157.24s)]
*  I don't want to give it validity, you know, where that becomes a self-fulfilling thing [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1163.56s)]
*  in my life. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1168.04s)]
*  I want to move in the opposite direction and push against that, you know, in every way [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1168.68s)]
*  possible. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1173.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1174.68s)]
*  I wanted to bring Amy Gordeev into this conversation. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1175.64s)]
*  She's the director of the Justice for Keith Lamar Foundation, speaking to us, I believe, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1178.68s)]
*  also from Youngstown, but not inside the prison, outside. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1184.52s)]
*  She's a high school teacher. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1188.44s)]
*  Amy, can you talk about what the Justice for Keith Lamar Foundation is and the kind of [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1190.2s)]
*  global outreach that Keith has been able to do from prison with the support, as he said, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1198.52s)]
*  of people working with him? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1206.2s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me on, Amy. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1209.24s)]
*  Justice for Keith Lamar has evolved. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1211.72s)]
*  It used to be just a group of friends and supporters here in Ohio, and it was kind of [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1214.84s)]
*  a slogan we had. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1222.04s)]
*  But in time, as our movement grew, we realized we needed to develop this into something more [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1223.32s)]
*  organized, and so we are now a 501c3 nonprofit organization. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1231.0s)]
*  Our mission is to bring healing and support to those who are wrongfully convicted. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1235.8s)]
*  And so as Keith has advocated for himself, it really, for me, I saw a lot of returns [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1243.32s)]
*  after he published his book, Condemned. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1252.04s)]
*  It just meant that people knew his story and wanted to be, you know, more involved with [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1254.28s)]
*  him, you know, just engaging in their various platforms. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1260.04s)]
*  And ultimately, the music led us to different continents all over the world, really. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1264.0400000000002s)]
*  And it's been really a very, very beautiful, meaningful thing to be able to involve more [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1269.64s)]
*  and more people who hear his story. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1274.5200000000002s)]
*  And again, what Keith said is so true that he is rare in this area because so often someone [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1276.68s)]
*  has talked about and they sit out of reach and out of our earshot. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1283.8000000000002s)]
*  And here's Keith advocating for himself at every step of the way. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1289.32s)]
*  I want to go back to Keith Lamar live on death row at the Ohio State Penitentiary in Youngstown, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1293.24s)]
*  not far from where Amy is right now, who's about to teach in high school in Youngstown. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1299.8s)]
*  Keith, I'm looking at an article in The New York Times from a few years ago, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1305.8799999999999s)]
*  Jazz freed Keith Lamar's soul. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1309.8799999999999s)]
*  Can it help him get off death row? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1311.8799999999999s)]
*  And it says, with constant, and I think it's a very, very important piece of information, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1313.8799999999999s)]
*  concerts and a new album, musicians are trying to draw attention to the case of an inmate [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1318.76s)]
*  convicted in the death of five other prisoners who they believe deserves a new trial. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1323.4s)]
*  And it talks about your working together with jazz musicians, with some of the greats, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1329.0s)]
*  like Albert Marquez, who's the pianist, composer, New York City schoolteacher, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1334.04s)]
*  people like Brian Jackson, Salim Washington, Arturo Farrell, Carolyn Davis, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1338.52s)]
*  who are involved with these Freedom First concerts. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1345.16s)]
*  The concerts that will lead up to the big event at Joe's Pub on May 31, your 56th birthday. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1348.2s)]
*  What's it like to make this music together, you with the poetry? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1355.88s)]
*  I saw the picture in your room. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1360.68s)]
*  You've got a keyboard? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1362.2s)]
*  KEITH LAMAR Yeah, I have a keyboard, you know, and a beginner's [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1363.0800000000002s)]
*  manual on how to play it, which, because of all the things you mentioned, I haven't really had [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1367.3200000000002s)]
*  too much time. But it's aspirational, more than anything, to be honest. Yeah. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1371.24s)]
*  So how do you work together? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1377.0800000000002s)]
*  KEITH LAMAR Yeah, yeah. Well, same way I'm working with you right now. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1378.28s)]
*  I'm sitting here west between the toilet and the door, and it's a real uncomfortable position, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1383.72s)]
*  but I have my eyes closed. I have on a pair of ear bulbs, and I just leave it all to the universe, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1389.88s)]
*  whatever. It's amazing. I mean, it shouldn't be possible. I say that in the lyrics. It shouldn't [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1397.64s)]
*  even be doable, the things that we are doing. You know, Abba Macass, who you mentioned, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1405.24s)]
*  had the idea, you know, after exchanging letters with me, that we could probably collaborate [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1411.0s)]
*  in this particular medium to, you know, elevate my story. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1416.68s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN Can you talk about your book clubs, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1421.16s)]
*  students around the country, high school kids meeting with you to talk about books? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1424.52s)]
*  Explain how it works. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1429.48s)]
*  KEITH LAMAR Well, the same way I'm talking to you now, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1430.84s)]
*  I call in, and a group of young people are gathered in the classroom. You know, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1434.92s)]
*  when I initially started the book club, it was attempt to pinpoint or go back and see where [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1441.8000000000002s)]
*  things went wrong in my own life. When I was 13, I was sent away to a juvenile facility for six [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1447.4s)]
*  months, and, you know, I had all the things that was—that is prevalent with young people [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1453.48s)]
*  like myself, you know, dysfunctional childhood, abuse, and all those things were present. But [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1460.92s)]
*  I'm thinking about what can I do? When was the opportunity for me to intervene and change the [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1467.64s)]
*  trajectory of my life? And although I started reading seriously when I was in my 20s, I thought [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1473.4s)]
*  that maybe if I could get some books back to my 13-year-old self, that maybe I could change the [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1478.8400000000001s)]
*  trajectory of that young person's life. And so I started off going into juvenile facilities here [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1484.76s)]
*  in Ohio, and that ultimately grew into this thing where I was, you know, going to high schools [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1489.48s)]
*  because I also realized that I was in high school, and I wasn't learning anything. You know, it's [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1495.4s)]
*  thing that Carl Young talked about, directed thinking and fantasy thinking, and I was absorbed [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1501.24s)]
*  in the fantasy side of it. I wasn't really—I didn't really know how to connect the dots, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1506.2s)]
*  and reading was the thing that allowed me to kind of cultivate that sense, and so I wanted to give [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1512.44s)]
*  that as a gift to young people to help them navigate the complex, because life is complicated, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1517.64s)]
*  and it's even more complicated when you are poor and disadvantaged, marginalized and all those other [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1522.44s)]
*  things, and reading, particularly autobiographies, you know, is the thing that helped me. And so [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1528.0400000000002s)]
*  I wanted to somehow go back and provide this material to young people. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1536.44s)]
*  Keith, thank you very much for spending this time with us live from Death Row from the Ohio State [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1542.04s)]
*  Prison in Youngstown, Ohio. Thank you for using GTL. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1548.52s)]
*  That's what he hears a lot when he's on the phone. Keith Lamar speaking from Death Row in Ohio. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1555.1599999999999s)]
*  He's scheduled to be executed in 2027. On May 31, a concert will be held at Joe's Pub here in New [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1562.52s)]
*  York to mark the release of his new album, Live from Death Row. Keith will perform from Death Row, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1569.96s)]
*  along with the jazz pianist Albert Marquez and others. We also spoke to his lawyer Keegan [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1576.8400000000001s)]
*  Stefan and Amy Gordeeva, director of the Justice for Keith Lamar Foundation. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZp5Fv2Cvvc&t=1583.0s)]
