*  In the occupied West Bank, Israel has admitted it strapped a wounded Palestinian man to the
*  hood of an Israeli military vehicle during a raid on the city of Jenin.
*  Israeli relatives and neighbors of the man, Mujahid Azmi, said Israeli soldiers used him
*  as a human shield instead of allowing him to get medical care after he'd been shot.
*  This is 13-year-old Ala Azmi.
*  ALA AZMI, Israeli Soldier, Mujahid Azmi's Family
*  We told them we want an ambulance for the wounded person in the room, so the army told
*  us to bring him to them.
*  We got him outside, and for about an hour or half an hour, we kept asking for an ambulance.
*  Then we called one.
*  Fifteen minutes later, two jeeps came, and they got in here.
*  The troops told us to turn around and not to look, and they put Mujahid on the jeep's
*  hood and took him.
*  After video of the incident went viral, the Israeli military released a statement claiming
*  the action was, quote, in violation of orders and standard operating procedures, unquote.

*  We are all broken and tired, and we want to make end to this tragedy.
*  NBC News is reporting two active-duty U.S. Air Force members are seeking conscientious
*  objector status, saying they can no longer serve in a military that's aiding Israel's
*  war on Gaza.
*  One of the airmen, Larry Ebert, made headlines in April for going on a hunger strike outside
*  the White House, where he held a sign that read,

*  military will soon shift its focus to Lebanon.

*  The people of the region and the people of the world cannot afford Lebanon to become

*  national strike Tuesday.
*  At least two young protesters have been killed.
*  21-year-old Evans Kuratu and 29-year-old Rex Kanyike.
*  Rex's mother decried the violent police response to the peaceful demonstrations.
*  If someone is fighting for their rights, why use live bullets?
*  If he would have been found with any weapons, we would have said he is undisciplined.
*  But he was walking with his friend.
*  Over 200 people were injured in the Kenyan protest, another 100 arrested.

*  of coming to The Post.
*  The decision comes days after it was revealed Winnett had a history of using fraudulently

*  Last week, The Guardian revealed Lewis advised then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and top
*  officials to clean up their phones amid public uproar over government violations of COVID
*  safety precautions in what became known as Partygate.
*  Lewis has also been accused of trying to suppress stories about his connection to the phone
*  hacking scandal at Rupert Murdoch's News of the World newspaper in Britain.
*  Last week, the owner of The Washington Post, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, voiced support
*  for Lewis.
*  And in Texas, a woman has been charged with attempted murder for attempting to drown a
*  three-year-old Palestinian girl at a swimming pool at an apartment complex.
*  The Texas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, CARE, is now calling for hate crime

*  feel safe with my kids.
*  My country is facing a war and we are facing that hate here,' unquote."
*  And those are some of the headlines.
