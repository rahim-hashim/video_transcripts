*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  A classified report by the Defense Intelligence Agency has concluded U.S. airstrikes on Iran [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  ordered by President Trump failed to collapse Iran's nuclear facilities buried deep underground. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=11.68s)]
*  That's according to three sources familiar with the report who say the Pentagon assessed [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=16.76s)]
*  Trump's attacks only set back Iran's nuclear program by months, rather than the total obliteration [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=21.12s)]
*  claimed by the president. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=27.92s)]
*  Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio rejected the DIA's findings, but on Tuesday the Trump [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  administration canceled congressional intelligence briefings on the Iran attack, prompting frustration [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=34.28s)]
*  from both Republicans and Democrats. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=41.04s)]
*  Illinois Democrat Mike Quigley told The Washington Post, quote, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=43.64s)]
*  "...they don't delay briefings that have good news." [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=46.72s)]
*  Unquote. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=49.8s)]
*  In Gaza, Al Jazeera reports at least 41 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=50.8s)]
*  including more Palestinians targeted by Israeli forces while seeking food and humanitarian aid. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=57.2s)]
*  This comes as Israel's issued new force displacement orders for northern Gaza. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=63.88s)]
*  Palestinians say there's no safe place left for them to go. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=69.64s)]
*  We are scared and terrified by these new and repeated Israeli threats that have been ongoing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=73.2s)]
*  since the start of this war, ordering us to go to the south of the Strip. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  So there is no safe area that we can go to. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=84.32s)]
*  At this stage, we prefer to die where we are rather than leave the north of the Strip for [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  the south. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  Israel's repeated targeting of Palestinians seeking aid also comes as the Trump administration's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  approved $30 million in funding for the new, shadowy U.S. and Israeli-backed aid operation, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is run by private contracting firms [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  led by former U.S. intelligence and military officers. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=109.56s)]
*  In Ukraine, a barrage of Russian missiles struck in and around the southeastern city [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=114.52s)]
*  of Dnipro on Tuesday, killing at least 19 people, injuring more than 270, including [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=118.64s)]
*  children. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  It was among the deadliest attacks on Ukraine since Russia's invasion, causing extensive [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  damage to schools, a cathedral, a sports arena, a music venue and eight medical centers, along [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=129.6s)]
*  with residences and even a passenger train. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=135.88s)]
*  Tuesday's attack came just one day after Russian strikes on the capital, Kiev, killed [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=138.28s)]
*  nine people and wounded more than 30 others. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=143.08s)]
*  Russia's stepped-up violence came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=145.6s)]
*  NATO summit in The Hague, where he's set to meet today with President Trump and other [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=150.12s)]
*  NATO leaders. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=154.4s)]
*  President Trump has shared personal messages from NATO Chief Mark Rutte, praising his decisive [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=156.76s)]
*  action against Iran's nuclear program and claiming U.S. strikes were not a violation [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=163.4s)]
*  of international law. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=168.02s)]
*  Non-NATO nations have widely condemned the U.S. attacks on Iran's nuclear sites, which [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=169.82000000000002s)]
*  U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres says will cause, quote, serious damage to the international [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=174.34s)]
*  order, unquote. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  On Tuesday, Rutte welcomed leaders of NATO's 32 member nations to a summit in The Hague, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=182.70000000000002s)]
*  where he echoed President Trump's call for a radical increase in military spending. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  The defense investment plan that allies will agree in The Hague introduces a new baseline, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=193.42s)]
*  5 percent of GDP to be invested in defense. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=199.94s)]
*  This is a quantum leap that is ambitious, historic and fundamental to securing our future. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=204.5s)]
*  Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called NATO's 5 percent target unreasonable, said [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=211.94s)]
*  Spain would hold its military spending at just over 2 percent of gross domestic product. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=216.46s)]
*  Meanwhile, protests are growing among citizens of NATO member nations. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=221.5s)]
*  On Tuesday, demonstrators marched through Slovenia's capital to oppose NATO expansion. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=225.34s)]
*  This means for us that the remnants of Social Security that we still have, from kindergartens [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=231.94s)]
*  and schools to the collapsing health system and now pension reform, all of this will continue [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  to be eaten away at, supposedly, because we would rather give it to militarization. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=241.54s)]
*  Governor of New York, in a stunning victory, Democratic Socialist and New York State Representative [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=246.58s)]
*  Zohran Mamdani has defeated the disgraced former governor, Andrew Cuomo, in New York [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=251.34s)]
*  City's Democratic mayoral primary. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=256.26s)]
*  Cuomo conceded Tuesday night after Mamdani took a commanding lead with over 43 percent [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=258.86s)]
*  of voters in the rank choice election. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=263.82s)]
*  Mamdani took to the stage Tuesday night as supporters burst into applause at his election [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  party. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=271.3s)]
*  Today, eight months after launching this campaign, with the vision of a city that every New Yorker [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=272.66s)]
*  could afford, we have won. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=282.94s)]
*  If elected in November's general election, Mamdani would become the first Muslim mayor [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=288.7s)]
*  of New York and, at 33 years old, its youngest mayor in over a century. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=293.3s)]
*  We'll have more on Mamdani's historic victory after headlines. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=298.54s)]
*  A federal court in New York has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=302.62s)]
*  of a Salvadoran immigrant who was wrongfully sent to El Salvador last month, despite the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=307.3s)]
*  same court instructing Trump officials in May not to remove the man from the U.S. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=311.26s)]
*  The Trump administration admitted it had removed Jordan Elgar Salmoran due to a confluence [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  of administrative errors, unquote. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=322.62s)]
*  This comes as immigration rights advocates nationwide are speaking up against the growing [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=325.88s)]
*  collaboration between local police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement as the Trump administration [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=329.32s)]
*  intensifies its mass raids. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=334.44s)]
*  In Los Angeles, community organizers rallied on Tuesday, decrying LAPD's complicity with [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=337.12s)]
*  ICE. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=342.76s)]
*  This is Ron Goetjes, member of the grassroots community defense group Unión del Barrio. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=343.76s)]
*  Speaking outside the LAPD headquarters in downtown Los Angeles, he showed footage of [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=348.68s)]
*  police officers standing in line with ICE agents during a recent raid. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=352.76s)]
*  I think the world is seeing the repression that we're living in Los Angeles, where [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=357.32s)]
*  people are kidnapping our community. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=361.28s)]
*  There are mass gunmen running around kidnapping people. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=362.92s)]
*  And today, the police department collaborated, participated, protected these operations. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=365.92s)]
*  So that's why we're out here today to denounce the police department. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=371.0s)]
*  This city is supposed to be a sanctuary city, but today it was proven that it is not. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=374.64s)]

*  record high, as Trump adviser Stephen Miller announced Operation At Large, a program to [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=389.0s)]
*  aggressively target immigrants with a daily quota of 3,000 ICE arrests per day. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=395.8s)]
*  A damning new report has exposed Stephen Miller's financial interests and Palantir, a tech and [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=403.08s)]
*  AI company that stands to make millions of dollars off Trump's immigration raids and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=408.92s)]
*  mass detention. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=413.68s)]
*  The public report says Miller owns between $100,000 and $250,000 in assets at Palantir, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=414.96s)]
*  which has been tapped by the Trump administration to compile information on U.S. residents for [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=423.44s)]
*  a master database based on tax returns, immigration records and more. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=427.7s)]
*  Palantir also has a $30 million contract with ICE to provide almost real-time visibility [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=432.36s)]
*  into immigrants' movements. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=438.34000000000003s)]
*  Palantir was co-founded by the far-right Trump-supporting billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=440.26s)]

*  plans to meet this week after accusing Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=451.98s)]
*  Jr. of stacking the panel with unqualified members and vocal vaccine critics. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=456.78000000000003s)]
*  Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a medical doctor who spent decades promoting [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=462.22s)]
*  vaccines for children, wrote that the group Kennedy appointed lacks experience studying [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=467.65999999999997s)]
*  microbiology, epidemiology or immunology. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=471.97999999999996s)]
*  Cassidy infamously voted to confirm R.F.K. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=475.09999999999997s)]
*  Jr. in February, despite Kennedy's long history of promoting public health conspiracy theories [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=477.62s)]
*  and anti-vaccine disinformation. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=483.58s)]

*  Cassidy that he would not change the makeup of the vaccine advisory panel. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=490.94s)]
*  This is Democratic Congressmember Kim Schreier of Washington. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=495.58s)]
*  You lied to Senator Cassidy. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=499.46s)]
*  You have lied to the American people. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=502.53999999999996s)]
*  You have lied to parents about vaccines for 20 years. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=504.41999999999996s)]
*  And I also want to be clear that I will lay all responsibility for every death from a [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=508.74s)]
*  vaccine-preventable illness at your feet. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=514.98s)]
*  In Kenya, thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Nairobi and other cities [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=519.02s)]
*  to mark a grim first anniversary of a youth-led uprising against high taxes, poor economic [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=524.24s)]
*  conditions and the rule of President William Ruto that was met by massive police violence [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=530.0s)]
*  last year. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=535.1600000000001s)]
*  For me, today means that revolution is coming to Kenya, and I pray that this is a day that [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=536.1600000000001s)]
*  will change everything, that Ruto will go today. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=542.0400000000001s)]
*  In response to this week's peaceful protests, Kenyan police blocked major roads leading [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=546.64s)]
*  to Nairobi's central business district and draped government buildings with razor wire. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=551.08s)]
*  The brutal crackdown and protests a year ago killed at least 60 people, with hundreds [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=556.68s)]
*  more injured. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=560.44s)]
*  And Nigeria's governments posthumously pardoned nine activists known as the Agoni Nine, who [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=561.64s)]
*  were hanged in 1995 after a sham military trial that targeted peaceful protesters demanding [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondtvVXlI8Q&t=566.24s)]
