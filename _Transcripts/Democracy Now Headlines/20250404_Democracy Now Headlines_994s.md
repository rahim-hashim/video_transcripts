The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday in a case that may cut off Planned Parenthood from Medicaid funding. Planned Parenthood says the move violates the Medicaid Act's "free choice of provider" provision, which says patients are entitled to choose their own doctors. The case, brought by the state of South Carolina, could impact the care of low-income patients who rely on Planned Parenthood for a range of non-abortion services, including cancer screenings and full physical exams. Federal law already bans Medicaid from funding abortions for patients in most cases. "South Carolina had a hard time trying to prove that it had a right to take away the dignity of patients who choose to go to Planned Parenthood," says Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

*  provider. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  It disables the state from doing something the state might otherwise want to do, like [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=56.12s)]
*  we want to take this provider out of Medicaid for a reason that's unrelated to medical [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  qualifications, which is what the state is doing here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=66.0s)]

*  Freedom, argue that the Medicaid statute does not mention the word right or its functional [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=73.72s)]
*  equivalent, and therefore individuals are not entitled to the right to provide medical [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=79.88s)]

*  Justice Elena Kagan, South Carolina, during Wednesday's oral arguments. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=97.0s)]
*  Do you agree that the state has an obligation here, is that correct? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=98.0s)]
*  To provide benefits on the plan, but significantly— [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=101.76s)]
*  The state has an obligation to provide this particular thing, right, which is—the state [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  to ensure that a person—I don't even know how to say this line without saying right—has [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=111.4s)]
*  a right to choose their doctor. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  That's what this provision is. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  It's impossible to even say the thing without using the word right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=121.12s)]
*  Has a benefit to choose their doctor? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  The state has to ensure that individuals have a benefit to choose their doctor? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=128.52s)]
*  The state has to ensure that individuals have a right to choose their doctor. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=133.68s)]
*  That's what this provision is. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=137.4s)]
*  Well, the language that you're focused on may obtain is not clear rights-creating [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=139.24s)]
*  language for four reasons. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=144.0s)]
*  I don't want four reasons. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=145.0s)]
*  I want you to answer my question. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  The obligation is to ensure that individuals can choose their doctor. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=149.16s)]
*  Outside the Supreme Court Wednesday, both pro- and anti-abortion protesters held rallies [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  as the justices inside considered South Carolina's bid to remove Planned Parenthood clinics from [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=161.84s)]
*  Medicaid programs. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=167.64s)]
*  For more, we're joined by Alexis McGill-Johnson, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=169.48s)]
*  Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=174.76s)]
*  Alexis, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=178.48s)]
*  Can you talk about what struck you most about Wednesday's oral arguments and what they [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  indicate, the direction the justices were going? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, good morning, Amy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=190.0s)]
*  It's wonderful to be here. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=192.12s)]
*  Look, I think that inside the court, the clip that you showed of Justice Kagan, I think [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=194.72s)]
*  laid bare how valuable it is, once again, to have these critically thoughtful female [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=202.68s)]
*  liberal justices asking the plain questions around what is a state's obligation to ensure [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=210.36s)]
*  non-discrimination and the provision of dignity for every patient around a federal program, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=218.6s)]
*  a federal insurance program like Medicaid. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=224.48s)]
*  I cannot read the tea leaves of the court, but I can tell you that I do believe that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=227.6s)]
*  South Carolina had a hard time trying to prove that it had a right to take away the dignity [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=232.68s)]
*  of patients who choose to go to Planned Parenthood. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=239.28s)]
*  And that's ultimately what this case is about. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  It is about whether or not Governor McMaster and his political agenda to try to take Planned [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=245.28s)]
*  Parenthood down in South Carolina really was in violation of what Congress intended when [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=252.4s)]
*  they set forth the Medicaid program and allowed patients to be able to have a free choice [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=260.72s)]
*  of their provider. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  And let's also think about why Congress did that, because states have been denying [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=271.16s)]
*  patients the right to do that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=276.6s)]
*  So I thought it was a very compelling conversation inside of the court, and I think it was made [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=279.24s)]
*  more so by the fine arguing of Nicole Saharsky, but also from those justices who really, really [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=284.88000000000005s)]
*  made it clear that the right to choose your own provider is just a matter of dignity. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=292.20000000000005s)]
*  Let's talk about even the state of reproductive care in South Carolina already. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=298.74s)]
*  Almost 40 percent of South Carolina counties are believed to be contraceptive deserts. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=305.38000000000005s)]
*  Can you talk about what kind of access, especially but not limited to low-income people who need [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=311.5s)]
*  that care? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=318.98s)]
*  Look, this is a story that we see all throughout the South right now, with so many of these [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=319.98s)]
*  states that have enacted these egregious abortion bans already had maternal care deserts. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=326.82s)]
*  They had deserts where very few counties even have practicing OB-GYNs. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=333.46s)]
*  And the result of that is that you end up with contraceptive deserts. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=339.38s)]
*  You end up with maternal care deserts. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  You end up with labor and delivery wards closing, precisely because many providers do not want [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  to stay in a state where they may be criminalized or fined for providing the care to the best [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=352.02s)]
*  of their ability to their patients. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=358.02s)]
*  Planned Parenthood is a health system that literally sits in the middle of the public [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=360.97999999999996s)]
*  health system and tries to strengthen it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=366.18s)]
*  Many patients that come to Planned Parenthood, we are the first point of entry into the health [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=369.7s)]
*  care system broadly. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=374.35999999999996s)]
*  And the fact that Governor McMaster would want to deny patients access to care when, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=376.3s)]
*  you know, many times we are the only safety net, the safety net of the safety net, they're [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=383.54s)]
*  providing care just seems completely bonkers to us as well. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=387.90000000000003s)]
*  And talk about what that care is. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=390.54s)]
*  It goes way beyond abortion. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=392.26s)]
*  Oh, of course it goes way beyond abortion. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=393.90000000000003s)]
*  It is STI testing. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=397.42s)]
*  It is access to contraception, wellness exams, breast cancer screenings, gender-affirming [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=398.98s)]
*  everything that someone would need to live a full and free, sexually healthy life. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=405.9s)]
*  And I think that, you know, again, in many cases, it is there's primary care being [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=412.74s)]
*  provided in Planned Parenthood health centers. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=418.02s)]
*  It is just basic health care. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=420.42s)]
*  And to have a state try to deny that is what this case is about using leavers like Medicaid. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=423.38s)]
*  Already South Carolina bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=429.38s)]
*  Correct. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=433.82s)]
*  Can you talk about Texas and 2021, Texas terminated Planned Parenthood from its state Medicaid [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=435.3s)]
*  program? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=441.82s)]
*  Talk about this precedent and also what it means if the conservative majority Supreme [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=443.34s)]
*  Court rules in favor of South Carolina. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=450.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=454.5s)]
*  So, you know, look, we have states that have, you know, taken various measures to attack [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=455.5s)]
*  Planned Parenthood and remove us from their state Medicaid system. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=462.46s)]
*  And the impact of that, again, is on the patients, right? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=466.38s)]
*  This isn't about Planned Parenthood. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=470.46s)]
*  This is about whether or not the patients have the right to use their health insurance [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=471.78s)]
*  in order to get access to the care of their choice, of their choosing from their provider. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=477.06s)]
*  You know, what will happen if the Supreme Court decides to rule in favor of South Carolina [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=482.85999999999996s)]
*  is that more states will act like South Carolina and Texas. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=489.34000000000003s)]
*  Many of those states that have enacted the most restrictive abortion bans will very likely [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=493.06s)]
*  try to remove Planned Parenthood from its ability to, or patients' ability to use Medicaid [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=497.66s)]
*  to go to Planned Parenthood. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=503.54s)]
*  So it can have very devastating consequence on the patients throughout those states and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=505.42s)]
*  their ability to get high quality care that we believe they deserve. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=510.82s)]
*  Can you explain what the powerhouse Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom is? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=514.5400000000001s)]
*  This is the group that brought the case against Planned Parenthood in South Carolina. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=521.7800000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=526.38s)]
*  So, this is, you know, a group that, should be no surprise, was incorporated in Amarillo, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=527.38s)]
*  Texas, so that any time they can bring a lawsuit, they can go directly to Judge Kaczmarek, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=534.5400000000001s)]
*  who is the only federal judge in the Northern District of Texas, a very friendly anti-abortion [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=541.34s)]
*  judge that, you know, has clearly opened his court to these kinds of cases and supporting [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=549.1800000000001s)]
*  them. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=555.14s)]
*  We are before that court right now on a false claims case, a meritless case, where not only [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=556.14s)]
*  has Texas kicked Planned Parenthood affiliates out of the Medicaid program there, they are [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=563.46s)]
*  also suing to recoup resources back to the state for all of the other services that have [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=568.78s)]
*  been provided in a bogus lawsuit that is intended to try to bankrupt Planned Parenthood. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=577.86s)]
*  And I think that, you know, we are watching just a patchwork of, you know, very Christian [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=585.02s)]
*  nationalists and anti-abortion organizations work with this, you know, new structural advantage [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=591.62s)]
*  that they have, both with the administration as it currently stands, the Supreme Court, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=600.42s)]
*  and the kind of patchwork of judicial system that has, you know, been co-opted by right-wing [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=606.62s)]
*  judges. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=612.82s)]
*  The Trump administration is withholding tens of millions of dollars from nine Planned Parenthood [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=613.82s)]
*  state affiliates that provide contraceptives and other vital reproductive care predominantly [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=619.74s)]
*  to low-income and people of color. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=625.8199999999999s)]
*  The providers received notices this week stating their Title X funding was being temporarily [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=628.06s)]
*  retained due to possible violations, they said, of Trump's policies against DEI, diversity, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=634.12s)]
*  equity and inclusion. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=641.78s)]
*  Health and Human Services has given the providers, which operate dozens of clinics nationwide, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=643.5s)]
*  including in Indiana and Kentucky, ten days to comply with Trump's demands to eliminate [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=648.34s)]
*  DEI initiatives. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=654.1800000000001s)]
*  In a letter, HHS pointed to mission statements and other public documents that highlight [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=656.1s)]
*  the clinic's commitment to black communities as supposed evidence of their noncompliance. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=660.6600000000001s)]
*  Alexis McGill-Johnson, you're the CEO of Planned Parenthood. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=667.46s)]
*  Your response? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=670.6600000000001s)]
*  I'm a CEO of Planned Parenthood. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=671.6600000000001s)]
*  I am a black woman. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=674.9000000000001s)]
*  I am a, you know, someone who cares deeply about reducing disparities in health care [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=676.3399999999999s)]
*  in communities as we all should. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=684.3s)]
*  I can't think of any American who would believe that the color of your skin should dictate [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=686.6999999999999s)]
*  what kind of care you get. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=693.0999999999999s)]
*  And that is what Planned Parenthood stands for. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=695.9s)]
*  No matter who you are, no matter where you live, no matter what your zip code is, no [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=699.06s)]
*  matter how you identify, no matter your documentation status, we are there to serve you and ensure [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=703.26s)]
*  that you get high quality, time sensitive care. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=710.42s)]
*  And so I think about the work that Planned Parenthood providers do every day, the way [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=714.1s)]
*  they have been able to leverage a critically important longstanding program like Title [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=718.14s)]
*  Ten to fund access to contraception and support communities. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=723.58s)]
*  The idea that the Trump administration would take those resources away or attempt to spend [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=729.7800000000001s)]
*  those resources because Planned Parenthood is committed to improving health outcomes [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=735.94s)]
*  in community. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=741.26s)]
*  That is essentially what they are saying. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=742.26s)]
*  What they are not saying is that this is, you know, just another one of the dozens of [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=744.94s)]
*  attacks that Planned Parenthood is facing as, you know, people who want to use any means [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=749.9000000000001s)]
*  that they have to deny access and resources to Planned Parenthood because they are trying [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=757.7s)]
*  to advance their anti-abortion agenda. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=763.22s)]
*  So are you sticking with the AI at these clinics or the clinics? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=765.1800000000001s)]
*  You know, each affiliate is going to make their decisions about how they enact improvements [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=768.6600000000001s)]
*  to health outcomes. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=776.6s)]
*  But at our core, right, at our core, reducing disparities, health disparities in community [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=778.6600000000001s)]
*  is what we do. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=784.1800000000001s)]
*  And I think that is really important for us to move away from, you know, just these trigger [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=785.78s)]
*  words like DEI and actually talk about what those words mean and what they mean in practice [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=792.58s)]
*  for our community, right? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=798.34s)]
*  Ensuring we have representation of everyone so that, you know, we have people who speak [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=799.86s)]
*  the same languages as our patients so that we can give them the best care, that we have, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=805.22s)]
*  you know, an ability to improve outcomes and ensure that people are getting the right resources [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=809.94s)]
*  to do so and that, you know, everyone is actually seen, not just seen by a doctor, but literally [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=815.62s)]
*  seen for who they are and what they want. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=821.58s)]
*  That is what I have in my healthcare system I go to. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=824.3000000000001s)]
*  I know when I walk into my provider, they know who I am. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=827.74s)]
*  They are able to, you know, see me and understand my particular needs. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=832.4200000000001s)]
*  And I think everyone in America deserves that. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=836.6600000000001s)]
*  And I can't imagine that this administration will be very popular in trying to deny other [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=838.7s)]
*  Americans that same right. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=843.1800000000001s)]
*  And finally, we just have a minute, but with Planned Parenthood under assault, you've [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=844.82s)]
*  also had a lot of victories. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=849.62s)]
*  Among them, in Wisconsin, Judge Susan Crawford, who once represented Planned Parenthood as [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=852.22s)]
*  an attorney, trounced the—Brad Schimel, the judge who was funded by, among others, the [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=858.5400000000001s)]
*  richest man in the world, Elon Musk. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=866.22s)]
*  The significance of this and other victories that you consider so important at this very [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=869.1400000000001s)]
*  fraught time. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=873.9s)]
*  Oh, Wisconsin was such a shot in the arm, I think, for this movement, for so many movements, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=875.9s)]
*  because I think what it shows is that the good people of Wisconsin and the good people [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=881.82s)]
*  of America do not want to be bought. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=884.66s)]
*  They want to do what is right. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=887.46s)]
*  They want the ability to make decisions, to continue to vote for freedom, and to ensure [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=889.62s)]
*  that their representation reflects that in their state. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=895.46s)]
*  And I think all of us looking to Wisconsin have a lot of hope about what is possible [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=900.18s)]
*  right now as we fight back with this administration. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=905.3s)]
*  I also think—I mean, and the practical implications of that, right? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=909.9399999999999s)]
*  We have a state that has voted in support of reproductive freedom, and to have a state [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=913.06s)]
*  Supreme Court to affirm that is going to be really important. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=918.02s)]
*  It's also going to be really important as we approach, in five years, the year 2030, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=921.54s)]
*  and we hit a redistricting year. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=927.66s)]
*  And so that we're able to kind of start to fight back structurally in the space that [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=930.86s)]
*  we are in. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=935.74s)]
*  I'd also point you to Missouri. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=936.74s)]
*  Amy, the people of Missouri voted to enshrine to actually flip a ban, abortion ban, in November. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=938.34s)]
*  And it's only been within the last month that the Missouri clinics have been able to [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=945.5400000000001s)]
*  provide access to abortion, because even when you win, you still have to defend it with [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=951.5400000000001s)]
*  and the state house that may not be favorable. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=958.34s)]
*  So that is the work that we have to be reminded of, that even when we win, we have to defend [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=960.74s)]
*  those wins fiercely and remind these electeds what we want and who we are and how powerful [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=965.7s)]
*  we will be to ensure that we get to maintain our freedoms. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFskMcnXSp8&t=972.1800000000001s)]
