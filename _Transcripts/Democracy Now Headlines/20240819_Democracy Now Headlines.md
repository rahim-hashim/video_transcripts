# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” August 19, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67oH1ZLMelw)
*  AMY GOODMAN, HOST, THE CURATOR, DEMOCRACY NOW!
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org.
*  This is War, Peace and the Presidency.
*  We are breaking with convention.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Thousands of delegates and elected officials have descended on Chicago as the Democratic
*  National Convention kicks off today.
*  The four-day convention comes one month after President Biden ended his bid for reelection.
*  Vice President Kamala Harris secured the Democratic presidential nomination in a virtual roll call
*  earlier this month and is expected to again formally accept the party's nomination when
*  she addresses the convention on Thursday night.
*  Dozens of delegates with the uncommitted movement are also in Chicago as they continue to pressure
*  Harris to halt U.S. military support for Israel's war on Gaza.
*  The delegates represent states where some 700,000 people cast uncommitted votes during
*  primaries to protest Democrats' pro-Israel policies.
*  For the first time ever, the DNC is hosting a panel on Palestinian human rights.
*  The uncommitted delegation welcome the move, but they're also continuing to request that
*  Dr. Tanya Hashasan, who's volunteered in Gaza, be permitted to address the convention
*  from the stage.
*  On Sunday, hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Chicago saying they'll disrupt
*  the DNC until Democrats listen to their demands.
*  This is Kshama Swant, co-founder of Worker's Strike Back and former socialist Seattle City Council member.
*  The possibility of Trump 2.0 is only a reality because of the many betrayals by the Biden-Harris administration.
*  Biden and Harris, both as president and vice president, and the Democratic Party as a whole,
*  they broke their promise for a $15 an hour minimum wage.
*  They blocked the railroad worker strike, which is possibly one of the most anti-worker, anti-union
*  actions that can be taken by politicians.
*  And so in other words, both the Democratic and Republican parties are anti-worker and
*  they are both pro-war.
*  Meanwhile, Chicago's Democratic Mayor Brandon Johnson in a recent interview called Israel's
*  war a genocide, saying, quote, what's happening right now is not only egregious, it is genocidal.
*  We have to acknowledge and name it for what it is and have the moral courage to exercise
*  our authority, the Chicago mayor said.
*  We'll have more from the DNC after headlines.
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken's in Israel, where he warned ongoing ceasefire talks may
*  be the last chance to free Hamas hostages as he spoke from Tel Aviv earlier today.
*  Blinken added, quote, it's also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that could
*  derail this process, unquote.
*  Inside Gaza, displaced Palestinians and Khajionis responded to Blinken's latest visit.
*  Today in the Gaza Strip, we are suffering from the Americans and international community
*  ganging up on us without mercy on us.
*  As I said, this visit is as usual to check on Israel and provide it with arms and logistic
*  matters to continue the war of extermination on the Gaza Strip.
*  There will be no changes.
*  We are very pessimistic about this visit.
*  Israel's slaughter continues throughout the Gaza Strip.
*  The Israeli military is pushing further into central Dera Bala as Gazans are now being
*  crowded into just 10 percent of the besieged territory.
*  On Saturday, an Israeli airstrike in Dera Bala killed at least 18 members of the same
*  family, including 11 siblings aged between two years old and 22.
*  On Sunday, another attack in the same region killed more Palestinian children.
*  Mohammed Awad Qattab said six of his grandchildren were killed as they slept along with their
*  mother, his daughter, who worked for the United Nations.
*  My daughter had been struggling to have children for years.
*  She had them through IVF.
*  Four of the children were quadruplets.
*  The eldest son and the youngest daughter, who was only a year and a half old, were also
*  killed.
*  What wrong did these innocent children do?
*  Were they posing any danger to Israel?
*  Were they carrying arms?
*  UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, is marking World Humanitarian Day today by
*  honoring its 207 staff members who've been killed by Israel since October 7th.
*  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is calling for a polio pause to conduct an urgent
*  vaccination campaign inside Gaza after health authorities confirmed a 10-month-old infant
*  had contracted the highly contagious disease.
*  Let's be clear.
*  The ultimate vaccine for polio is peace and an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
*  But in any case, a polio pause is a must.
*  It is impossible to conduct a polio vaccination campaign with war raging all over.
*  The 10-month-old baby is Gaza's first known case of polio in a quarter of a century.
*  In Israel, relatives of hostages held in Gaza rallied in Tel Aviv this weekend ahead of
*  Tony Blinken's visit.
*  This is Lee Siegel, whose brother is one of the remaining hostages.
*  We are broken.
*  We are sad.
*  We are tired.
*  We wake up in the morning thinking about the hostages.
*  Maybe this will be the day when they come home.
*  We go to sleep every night thinking tomorrow morning we will wake up to a better day.
*  This morning was not a better day.
*  True negotiations are ongoing.
*  Until the hostages are home, negotiations mean nothing.
*  Meanwhile, Hamas and the Islamic Jihad say they are responsible for an explosion in a
*  truck in Tel Aviv Sunday evening.
*  The blast killed one person believed to be the detonator of the explosive, the suicide
*  bomber.
*  Regional tensions remain high amidst ongoing attacks around the Israel-Lebanon border.
*  Lebanese state media reported an Israeli strike in the south of the country killed at least
*  10 Syrian nationals Saturday, including two children.
*  This is a witness of the attack.
*  Honestly, a number of workers were martyred on the site, including the janitor, along
*  with his wife and two children.
*  With them were a number of workers who also lived in the same building.
*  They are all Syrians.
*  This is a civil establishment that works in metal trades for hangars, false ceilings and
*  homes and has nothing to do with military things at all.
*  Meanwhile, Israeli forces earlier today raided the town of Hula in southern Lebanon, according
*  to local reports.
*  In Sudan, a cholera outbreak has killed over 300 people, according to the World Health
*  Organization.
*  The highly contagious infection transmitted through contaminated food or water can cause
*  severe diarrhea and dehydration.
*  Sudan is facing catastrophic humanitarian situation, with famine declared in a camp
*  in North Darfur and over 10 million displaced since the civil war erupted last April.
*  This is Lenny Kensley of the World Food Program.
*  It is the world's largest hunger crisis.
*  25.6 million people are in acute hunger, are facing acute hunger.
*  That's 54 percent of the population.
*  So basically that means one in two Sudanese is not able to put a basic meal on their plate
*  every day, are struggling every day just to eat.
*  Of those, around 755,000 people are in the highest stage of food insecurity, catastrophic
*  hunger, which basically means they've run out of all options and are surviving in whatever
*  way they can, eating leaves, off trees, eating grass.
*  The Sudanese government is sending a delegation to Cairo for talks with U.S. and Egyptian
*  officials after failing to attend peace talks in Geneva last week.
*  The talks in Egypt will reportedly be restricted to discussing the implementation of last
*  year's JEDA agreement, which is supposed to uphold humanitarian protections during
*  the bloody conflict.
*  Back in the United States, Kamala Harris unveiled her economic policy agenda during a campaign
*  speech in Raleigh, North Carolina, Friday.
*  As president, I will be laser-focused on creating opportunities for the middle class that advance
*  their economic security, stability and dignity.
*  Together we will build what I call an opportunity economy.
*  Harris' plan includes bringing down the cost of housing, child care and health care.
*  The Democratic nominee said she'll restore and expand child tax credits, cancel medical
*  debt, cap the cost of drugs, ban price gouging on groceries, and go after predatory corporate
*  landlords, among other things.
*  In other election news, Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein announced historian
*  and professor Butch Ware as her running mate.
*  Jill Stein, who also ran on the Green Party ticket in 2012 and 2016, has made a Gaza
*  ceasefire one of the main pillars of her platform.
*  In a post announcing her VP pick, Stein wrote, quote, This is truly a historic ticket, bringing
*  together a Jewish woman and a black Muslim man against genocide, endless war, climate
*  collapse and rampant injustice, and for an economy that works for working people, a livable
*  future for our children and an America and a world that works for all of us, she said.
*  Stein and Butch Ware held a virtual press conference Saturday.
*  APAC and the arms manufacturers have bought and paid for both of these parties.
*  So of course they cannot agree to an arms embargo because those checks have already
*  been cashed, right?
*  They have their projections of all of the future income off of the endless future war.
*  And in health news, Philippines is the latest country to report a new case of MPAX.
*  Authorities say the 33-year-old Filipino patient came from Manila, had no history of foreign
*  travel.
*  Last week, the World Health Organization declared MPAX a global public health emergency after
*  an outbreak spread from the Democratic Republic of Congo to a dozen neighboring countries.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now, democracynow.org.
*  War, Peace and the Presidency.
*  We're breaking with convention.
