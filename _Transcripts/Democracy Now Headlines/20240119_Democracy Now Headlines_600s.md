# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” January 19, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxNxT8ki5Jc)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Mexico and Chile have requested the International Criminal Court investigate Israel for committing
*  war crimes against civilians in Gaza, as outrage grows over Israel's 15-week assault on the
*  besieged territory, which has killed nearly 25,000 Palestinians, over 10,000 of them children.
*  On Thursday, the European Union Parliament passed a resolution calling for a Gaza ceasefire
*  on the condition that all hostages be released and Hamas dismantled.
*  This comes as Gaza enters its eighth day under a near-complete communications blackout, the
*  longest blackout to date.
*  Israel's continuing to attack areas across the Gaza Strip.
*  This is a Palestinian mother in Chanyunas, after learning her son had been killed in
*  an Israeli strike.
*  I'm hurting like a burning blaze.
*  I told my husband, let's pray for Abdullah.
*  He will come back.
*  But it was my last goodbye for him.
*  May God have mercy on his soul.
*  They took my heart from me.
*  I was waiting for my son, but he didn't come back.
*  I hadn't slept for three nights praying for him.
*  They told me he's in the European hospital, and I was praying that it wouldn't be true.
*  In news from Israel, police have arrested seven people after they blocked a major highway
*  in Tel Aviv during a protest calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach an agreement
*  that would secure the release of the remaining 132 hostages held in Gaza.
*  Meanwhile, Netanyahu has publicly rejected calls by the Biden administration for the
*  future establishment of a Palestinian state.
*  He called for Israel to be in control of the region from the river to the sea,
*  from Jordan River to the Mediterranean.
*  Therefore, I clarify that in any arrangement in the foreseeable future,
*  with an accord or without an accord, the state of Israel must have security control over the
*  entire territory west of the Jordan River. That's a necessary condition.
*  It clashes with the principle of sovereignty. What can you do?
*  Many commentators noted Netanyahu was essentially calling for Israel to control the land from the
*  river to the sea, a phrase many Palestinian supporters have been denounced for using,
*  even when calling for the formation of a single state where everyone has equal rights.
*  The United States has bombed Yemen for the fifth time over the past week.
*  On Thursday, President Biden acknowledged the U.S. strikes,
*  which were conducted without congressional authorization,
*  have failed to stop Houthi forces from Yemen from attacking ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of
*  Aden. Houthis have vowed to keep targeting ships until Israel stops
*  attacking Gaza. The U.S. House and Senate passed a
*  short-term spending bill Thursday to avert a partial government shutdown ahead of today's
*  midnight deadline. The measure extends funding for some federal agencies and programs,
*  as well as the Pentagon, through early March. At the eleventh hour, the far-right Freedom Caucus
*  unsuccessfully attempted to add border crackdown measures to the House bill.
*  The hardline lawmakers vowed to retaliate against House Speaker Mike Johnson
*  by thwarting upcoming legislative action. The Justice Department pointed to a series
*  of cascading failures in the response to the 2022 school massacre in Uvalde, Texas,
*  which killed 19 children and two teachers. Hundreds of law enforcement officers stood by,
*  377 to be exact, as the massacre unfolded for 77 minutes. As he revealed the findings of his
*  agency's investigation, Attorney General Merrick Garland said lives would have been saved had
*  officials followed standard protocol. Families of the victims spoke after the release of the
*  600-page report. This is Kimberly Matarubio, who lost her 10-year-old daughter, Lexi.
*  I hope that the failures end today and that local officials
*  do what wasn't done that day, do right by the victims and survivors of Robb Elementary,
*  terminations, criminal prosecutions,
*  and our state and federal government inact sensible gun laws because Robb Elementary
*  began the day an 18-year-old wasn't allowed to purchase an AR-15. Along with other grieving
*  family members, Kimberly Matarubio founded the gun control advocacy group Lives Robbed. The school
*  where everyone was killed was the Robb Elementary School. We'll have more in Uvalde after
*  headlines. Amidst multiple legal woes, Donald Trump posted an all-caps message to his Truth
*  social platform, claiming, quote, A president of the United States must have full immunity,
*  even for events that, quote, cross the line. The Post reignited fear of an authoritarian
*  crackdown on democracy if Trump is reelected. The ex-president ended his rant by writing,
*  God bless the Supreme Court. Trump appointed three of the nine sitting justices on the
*  right-wing majority court, which is likely to rule on Trump's eligibility to appear on the 2024
*  ballot, as well as whether he can be shielded from prosecution. Ruth Ben-Giott, an NYU professor and
*  expert on authoritarianism, said, quote, Trump is telling Americans very clearly that he will be
*  jailing and killing Americans. Anyone who votes for him is complicit with these future crimes,
*  unquote. In Haiti, a neighborhood in the capital Port-au-Prince has been under siege for at least
*  four days and an ongoing attack by gang members. The sound of automatic weapons echoed through the
*  streets of Salino while many community members remained trapped inside their homes behind flaming
*  barricades. I'm on the street because of armed gangs. They took my house. I was sheltering in
*  another neighborhood, but they invaded it, too. I'm in the street now. I don't know where to go.
*  Violence in Haiti has been escalating for months under interim Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who's
*  backed by the United States, forcing thousands to flee. Henry became the de facto ruler following
*  the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise in 2021. In Iran, authorities have sentenced
*  Nobel Peace Prize laureate Nargis Mohammadi to an additional 15 months in prison, accusing the human
*  rights leader of spreading propaganda while behind bars. Her family says this is Mohammadi's fifth
*  criminal conviction since 2021. She's been in and out of prison for the last two decades over
*  her activism. In California, United staff of the Los Angeles Times are holding a one-day multi-city
*  walkout today to protest massive planned job cuts. It's the first ever newsroom work stoppage in the
*  history of the L.A. Times. Over 100 journalists or about 20 percent of the newsroom are reportedly
*  at risk of losing their jobs. This comes less than a year after the paper cut 74 newsroom jobs.
*  The L.A. Times is owned by the billionaire Patrick Soon-Shang. A Mississippi poultry plant faces over
*  $200,000 in fines for the death of a teenage worker who was killed last year after being pulled into
*  a chicken deboning machine. The Department of Labor cited 17 violations against the Marjack
*  poultry plant. The death of 16-year-old Devon Perez was the second fatality recorded at the
*  factory in just over two years. The teen was from Guatemala. At least 40 people have died across nine
*  states over the past week amidst widespread winter storms and record wind chills. Tennessee was has
*  seen the highest death toll with 14 fatalities. More snow and freezing temperatures are expected
*  today from the Midwest to the East Coast. And the Senate held its first ever hearing on long
*  COVID amidst a winter surge in COVID infections. Patients and health experts appealed for more
*  funding and research into the condition as well as proper insurance coverage while detailing its
*  debilitating effects which can include extreme fatigue, chronic pain and what's often described
*  as brain fog. This is long COVID researcher Dr. Ziad Al Ali. Long COVID affects at least 20 million
*  Americans. It affects people across the lifespan. We have kids with long COVID. We have people who
*  are 100 years old with long COVID. It affects people across the lifespan and across demographic
*  groups. The burden of long COVID, the burden of disease and disability from long COVID, when you
*  measure it is on par with the burden of cancer and heart disease. And those are some of the
*  headlines. This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman.
