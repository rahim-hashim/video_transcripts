**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQDZb4CDONs)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The United Nations has paused aid operations in Gaza after Israel ordered another mass
*  evacuation from Deir Ebalah, where the U.N. had been forced to move its operations center
*  after Israel attacked Ra'afah.
*  This comes as medical staff had been forced to evacuate patients from Al-Aqsa Martyrs
*  Hospital, the last functioning medical facility in central Gaza.
*  This is Louise Wateridge of the U.N. agency UNRWA, speaking from Deir Ebalah.
*  To describe the situation here, it's just catastrophic.
*  The last couple of weeks, we have had relentless forced displacement orders in the Middle Area,
*  in the Southern Area and also in northern Gaza Strip.
*  And what we're seeing here is hundreds of thousands of people forced to move on a daily
*  basis.
*  Humanitarian operations are also being displaced within these evacuation orders, and the humanitarian
*  response here is being completely strangled and limited, our ability of what we can do.
*  The Israeli military has revealed the United States has sent over 50,000 tons of arms and
*  military equipment to Israel since October 7th.
*  The weapons have arrived in more than 500 transport planes and over 100 ships, an average of almost
*  two arm shipments a day for the past 10 months, during which time Israel has killed over 40,400
*  Palestinians, including 20 Palestinians this morning in the occupied West Bank.
*  An Israeli airstrike has hit the Norsh Shams refugee camp near the city of Tulkarim.
*  Five deaths were reported.
*  Meanwhile, Jewish settlers shot dead one Palestinian and wounded six others in an attack near Bethlehem.
*  Meanwhile, Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gavir, has sparked outrage
*  after he repeated his call to allow Jewish worshipers be allowed to pray at the Al-Aqsa
*  Mosque in Jerusalem.
*  He also said he would build a synagogue on the site of the mosque if he could.
*  The Foreign Ministry of Jordan decried Ben-Gavir's remarks as a, quote,
*  "...violation of international law and an unacceptable incitement."
*  Fears are growing of an environmental catastrophe in the Red Sea.
*  A Greek-flagged crude oil tanker has been on fire since August 23rd after being attacked
*  by Houthi fighters from Yemen.
*  The tanker is carrying 150,000 tons of crude oil.
*  That's more than one million barrels of oil.
*  The Houthi movement is vowed to continue targeting ships as long as Israel continues to attack Gaza.
*  Russia has launched another wave of strikes on Ukraine, killing at least four people.
*  This comes a day after Russia launched one of its biggest air attacks of the war targeting
*  Ukraine's energy infrastructure.
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed to respond to the Russian strikes, which come
*  three weeks after Ukrainian ground troops launched a surprise incursion into Russia.
*  In Pakistan, the separatist Baluchistan Liberation Army has taken responsibility for a series
*  of attacks that killed more than 40 people in southwestern Pakistan.
*  The coordinated attacks targeted police stations, railway lines and highways.
*  More than 20 separatist fighters also died in the attacks, the deadliest by the group
*  in years.
*  Major polluting nations, including the United States, are facing new calls to pay for their
*  role in causing the climate crisis.
*  At a major summit in the Pacific, the message from the low-lying Tuvalu nation was, if you
*  pollute, you should pay.
*  U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres spoke in Tonga and said ocean temperatures are rising
*  in the Pacific Islands at three times the rate worldwide.
*  The world must look to the Pacific and listen to science.
*  This is a crazy situation.
*  Rising seas are a crisis entirely of humanity's making, a crisis that will soon swell to an
*  In Uganda, security forces violently cracked down on climate activists in the capital Kampala
*  as they protested the East African crude oil pipeline known as ECOP.
*  At least 21 people were arrested.
*  The Ugandan government said it might forcibly take over land from over 100 people for the
*  pipeline construction, some of whom have already refused compensation and resettlement.
*  ECOP is a 900-mile pipeline which is set to transport oil from Uganda to Tanzania's
*  Indian Ocean port of Tanga.
*  France's Total Energies and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation are behind ECOP,
*  with Ugandan and Tanzanian state-owned oil firms.
*  In eastern Sudan, at least 60 people were killed when the Arbat Dam collapsed, washing
*  away entire villages.
*  At least 130 people in Sudan have been killed in recent days from torrential downpours and
*  flooding.
*  The Arbat Dam supplied drinking water for the coastal city of Port Sudan, where Sudan's
*  military is based.
*  The situation is catastrophic, to be honest.
*  We have children, families, elderly and others that need continuous medication, and this
*  is the fourth day.
*  The issue is not just the food that we need to send.
*  The water came into them and destroyed all the villages, and we don't know the circumstances
*  they are going through now.
*  We call on the state's government and the Sovereignty Council to quickly intervene.
*  Today marks 500 days since Sudan's civil war broke out, triggering a devastating humanitarian
*  crisis.
*  More than 10 million people have been displaced, tens of thousands killed and injured.
*  There have been widespread reports of sexual violence and famine, and cholera have been
*  reported in camps for displaced people.
*  Recent international peace talks quickly petered out, as the Sudanese army and their rival
*  Rapid Support Forces paramilitary refused to negotiate.
*  French President Emmanuel Macron is refusing to name a new prime minister in government,
*  led by the progressive New Popular Front coalition, launching a fresh round of talks while France
*  remains at a political impasse.
*  The New Popular Front coalition, which quickly came together to stave off a possible far-right
*  victory, gained the largest number of seats in July's legislative elections, a snap
*  election called by Macron.
*  The leftist France Unbowed Party, a member of the New Popular Front, is calling for mass
*  demonstration September 7th.
*  President Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan is in China meeting with China's
*  top diplomat Wang Yi.
*  Sullivan is the first U.S. national security adviser to travel to China since 2016.
*  In related news, Canada has announced it will impose a 100 percent tariff on Chinese-made
*  electrical vehicles following a similar move by the Biden administration.
*  China condemned the move, saying it was in violation of World Trade Organization rules.
*  In campaign news, Donald Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance are attempting to downplay
*  their anti-abortion record.
*  On Friday, Trump claimed he, quote, will be great for women and their reproductive rights,
*  unquote.
*  Meanwhile, J.D. Vance claimed on Sunday Trump would veto a federal abortion ban.
*  He made the comment in an interview with Christine Welker on Meet the Press.
*  Senator Graham said to me, I'm going to keep saying that there should be a federal ban.
*  If such a piece of legislation landed on Donald Trump's desk, would he veto it?
*  I think it would be very clear he would not support it.
*  But would he veto it?
*  Yeah, I mean, if you're not supporting it as the president of the United States, you
*  fundamentally have to veto it.
*  So he would veto a federal abortion ban?
*  I think he would.
*  He said that explicitly that he would.
*  Senator Elizabeth Warren later appeared on Meet the Press and responded to Vance's claim.
*  American women are not stupid, and we are not going to trust the futures of our daughters
*  and granddaughters to two men who have openly bragged about blocking access to abortion
*  for women all across this country.
*  Special counsel Jack Smith has asked a federal appeals court to reinstate the criminal case
*  against Donald Trump for illegally keeping classified national security documents after
*  his presidency ended.
*  The case was dismissed last month by federal judge Aileen Cannon, who ruled Attorney General
*  Merrick Garland had no authority to appoint Smith as a special counsel.
*  In a brief, Smith argued Cannon's decision ignored decades of Supreme Court precedent
*  and misconstrued the statutes that authorize the special counsel's appointment.
*  Aileen Cannon was nominated by President Trump.
*  The League of United Latin American Citizens has asked the Justice Department to open a
*  probe after Texas officials raided the homes of a number of Latino-elected leaders, candidates
*  and political operatives in South Texas.
*  American Attorney General Ken Paxton is facing accusations he's using his office to harass
*  and intimidate Latinx voters in an effort to suppress their votes.
*  In other voting news, the Democratic National Committee and the Georgia Democratic Party
*  have sued to halt new election rules in Georgia that Democrats fear could be used to block
*  certification of election results if Democrats win in November.
*  Under the new rules, local election officials could delay certifying election results until
*  they conduct what's described as a reasonable inquiry.
*  The Democratic lawsuit warns this new rule could, quote,
*  "...invite chaos after Election Day."
*  Journalist Ari Berman recently wrote, quote,
*  "...five alarm fire for democracy in Georgia.
*  MAGA majority on state election board laying groundwork not to certify election if Trump
*  loses again.
*  They're telegraphing exactly how they're planning to try to steal the election this
*  time."
*  Unquote.
*  In other news from Georgia, a 12-foot statue of the late civil rights icon and congressman
*  John Lewis has been unveiled outside the historic Decatur Courthouse in Outer Atlanta.
*  The statue replaces a Confederate obelisk that was taken down in 2020 during the Black
*  Lives Matter protests in response to the police murder of George Floyd.
*  In immigration news, a federal judge in Texas sided with 16 Republican-led states halting
*  a Biden administration policy that would give spouses of U.S. citizens legal status
*  without having to first leave the country.
*  The policy would prevent families from being separated, possibly for years-long stretches,
*  and could offer a path to citizenship for up to half a million people.
*  The mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, is calling on city lawmakers to pass four new public
*  safety policies in response to a series of Nazi gatherings in the city.
*  One policy creates buffer zones around public buildings.
*  Another prohibits the placement of signs over highways.
*  A third bans the distribution of handbills before sunrise or after sunset.
*  And the pioneering climate journalist Peter Dykstra has died at the age of 67.
*  After 17 years at CNN, he became the publisher of Environmental Health News and The Daily
*  Climate.
*  Prior to his time at CNN, he spent over a decade working for Greenpeace.
*  He appeared on Democracy Now!
*  a decade ago and talked about corporate media coverage of the climate crisis.
*  I would ask people sometime soon, watch a half hour of network news one of the next
*  few evenings.
*  What you won't see, in all likelihood, is serious discussion of climate change.
*  What you will see are one or two or three commercials from the oil and coal industry
*  talking about generating jobs and keeping the lights lit and keeping America prosperous
*  and keeping us away from foreign oil.
*  The pioneering climate journalist Peter Dykstra speaking in 2014.
*  He died on July 31st at the age of 67.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org.
