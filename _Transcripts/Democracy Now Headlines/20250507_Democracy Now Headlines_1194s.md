A historic settlement is being hailed as a landmark victory for hundreds of women who survived abuse by Dr. Robert Hadden, a former Columbia University gynecologist. For over two decades, Columbia ignored his patients who spoke out, undermined prosecutors and shielded the sexual predator. “The university knew all the way back into the ’90s about what he was doing and how he was mistreating patients, but did nothing but lie, cover it up and expose more unsuspecting patients to a known serial predator,” says Anthony T. DiPietro, an attorney representing survivors in the case against Hadden.

One survivor, Eva Santos Veloz, visited Dr. Hadden at age 18. “This was my first birth,” says Veloz. “During my labor, he sexually assaulted me multiple times, not just once.”

On Tuesday, lawyers representing the women announced Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian agreed to pay $750 million after the former doctor abused the women under the guise of medical examinations. Legal payouts now top more than $1 billion, following earlier settlements. “The settlement is huge,” says Laurie Maldonado, another survivor and plaintiff in lawsuits against Hadden. “It was just a huge win for all of survivors, including Hadden survivors, but all of survivors.”

*  For more, we're joined by two women who sued after surviving Haddon's abuse. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=91.4s)]
*  Lori Maldonado was a gynecologist. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=97.16s)]
*  Lori Maldonado is with us. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=101.88s)]
*  She was an OB-GYN patient of Haddon's between 2003 and 2012. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=104.44s)]
*  Eva Santos-Vellos was just 18 years old when Haddon was assisting in an emergency delivery, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=110.32s)]
*  and she says sexually abused her. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=118.16s)]
*  We're also joined by their attorney, Anthony DiPietro, who's representing hundreds of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=120.84s)]
*  sexual abuse claims by former patients of Robert Haddon. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=126.84s)]
*  We welcome you all to Democracy Now! [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=129.72s)]
*  Lori, let's begin with you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=132.95999999999998s)]
*  It has been years now, but this is an enormous accomplishment, not just the money settlement, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=135.32s)]
*  but the laws you all have gotten past, for example, in New York State alone, to allow [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  people who'd been abused decades ago to be able to come forward and sue Dr. Haddon, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=148.72s)]
*  who's in prison, but also take on a medical institution. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  If you could quickly, if you feel comfortable, saying what happened to you, and Eva, I want [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  to ask you the same, and then what it took, even if it took years, because of whatever [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=165.84s)]
*  your reasons for coming forward, and your response to this settlement. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=171.72s)]
*  Yeah, thank you so much, Amy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=176.96s)]
*  I know Democracy Now! has covered our story numerous times. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=178.84s)]
*  I think we've been on here four times, so thank you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=182.96s)]
*  It means so much. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=186.04s)]
*  The settlement is huge. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=188.24s)]
*  It was just a huge win for all of survivors, including Haddon survivors, but all of survivors. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=190.8s)]
*  And I also have to say that it took a really long road to get there. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  Anthony DiPietro has been at that fight for more than 10 years. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=200.84s)]
*  A lot of us have just joined, or have been in it for years, but there's been so much [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  coming forward. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=211.68s)]
*  It really has been on the voice of survivors, and the bravery of survivors sharing their [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=212.84s)]
*  stories, their vulnerabilities, and it's been survivors who have notified other survivors [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=219.72s)]
*  to come forward. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=226.52s)]
*  Haddon is the biggest sexual predator in the history of the United States. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=228.4s)]
*  Eva and I are a few of thousands of women that he sexually abused. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=234.44s)]
*  I was sexually assaulted two days before the birth of my son. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=241.88000000000002s)]
*  But there are so many women that were— [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=247.72s)]
*  You went to him because you were about to give birth, and he said to come to his office [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=251.72s)]
*  rather than the hospital for a checkup. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=257.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=260.2s)]
*  And the pain that he caused, the physical pain, yeah, it was just egregious. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=263.72s)]
*  How long did it take you, and when did you realize that this was—you were not alone? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=276.52000000000004s)]
*  Oh, gosh. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=282.12s)]
*  I first found out when a woman came forward, Lori Kenyot came forward, called 911. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=284.6s)]
*  There was, in the newspaper on the subway, it was like, Guy know is a sicko, so that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=292.52s)]
*  was my first— [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  So you're looking across the subway at the guy across from you, and they have a newspaper [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=300.91999999999996s)]
*  and a picture of your doctor, Guy know is a sicko, and you go, that's Dr. Haddon? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=305.24s)]
*  That's my doctor, and that's my doctor of almost 10 years. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=310.28s)]
*  That's my doctor of my first OB-GYN. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=315.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=319.88s)]
*  So it was women kind of notifying other women. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=321.88s)]
*  Other people have been notified by Instagram, on subway ads. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=326.76s)]
*  And I first was following it, and I first, of course, came forward to—I was moved to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=332.96s)]
*  another doctor and just asked, was this a medical procedure? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=339.68s)]
*  No. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=345.44s)]
*  And at that point, Columbia, they kind of do their best to sort of silence you, so it [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=347.2s)]
*  took me a while. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=355.92s)]
*  I think it took me a while to overcome the shame and the fear. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=357.24s)]
*  And then once I did, and I came forward to Anthony and was a part of this legal lawsuit, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=363.24s)]
*  I really found my voice. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=372.76s)]
*  And I noticed that the more that I spoke, the more women came forward. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=375.0s)]
*  And that happened again after, you know. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=381.12s)]
*  And we're really—it's women's work, it's survivors' work, but there's legal's work. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=383.0s)]
*  We've had investigative journalists. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=389.72s)]
*  There's so many things that have happened. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=392.44s)]
*  And Laurie, when you mentioned that Columbia did what they could to silence you, could [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=394.92s)]
*  you talk about that? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=399.4s)]
*  The fact that the university for so long had to be aware of what was going on but did nothing [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=400.54s)]
*  about it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=406.58000000000004s)]
*  Juan just asked you, Laurie, you said Columbia silenced you but did nothing about it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=407.58000000000004s)]
*  Explain what took place. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=413.94s)]
*  I remember seeing you when Manu Shafik, the former president of Columbia, was being inaugurated. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=415.66s)]
*  And the survivors were there, all these medical doctors at Columbia, residents, students in [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=421.82000000000005s)]
*  their white coats protesting, demanding that Columbia alert all of the patients of Haddon [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=427.18s)]
*  about what, you know, what he's being charged with if they wanted to come forward. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=433.94s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=438.94s)]
*  There were—Columbia University, they never notified patients up until a few days before [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=441.06s)]
*  survivors had a chance to take legal action. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=450.22s)]
*  So there was more than 6,000 patients. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=452.18s)]
*  And yeah, they finally notified after protest. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=455.1s)]
*  And that was really important. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=459.58000000000004s)]
*  I'd like to ask Eva Santos if you could talk about your situation, specifically, you were [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=463.74s)]
*  undocumented at the time you first dealt with Dr. Haddon or were a patient of his and how [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=470.78000000000003s)]
*  that affected your ability to speak out? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=479.34000000000003s)]
*  Sure. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=482.34000000000003s)]
*  So, I mean, being undocumented back then in 2008 was the main reason why I couldn't speak [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=483.41999999999996s)]
*  up. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=492.41999999999996s)]
*  I felt afraid of being a Latina woman in a country that already doesn't stand up for [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=493.41999999999996s)]
*  us. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=500.02s)]
*  And I just felt really afraid and ashamed if I was going to be—if they were going to [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=501.17999999999995s)]
*  believe me. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=505.85999999999996s)]
*  So I didn't say anything. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=506.85999999999996s)]
*  I bottled it up for years until I was finally able to see powerful women like Lori, like [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=510.62s)]
*  Marisa come forward that gave me the courage to know that I was going to be protected. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=517.66s)]
*  Also, Anthony DiPietro gave me the power and courage to finally know that what I went through [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=522.86s)]
*  was real and it wasn't something that was just being silent and hidden by Colombia. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=529.98s)]
*  You were giving birth to your first son at the age of 18 and you were in emergency delivery [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=537.1s)]
*  and this guy walks in? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=543.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=545.46s)]
*  2008? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=546.46s)]
*  Yeah, I was 18 years old. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=547.46s)]
*  This was my first birth. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=549.1800000000001s)]
*  During my labor, he sexually assaulted me multiple times, not just once. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=552.0600000000001s)]
*  I was there for many hours and he used his power in order to make me feel like what he [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=558.3000000000001s)]
*  was doing was right. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=565.4599999999999s)]
*  You were undocumented, afraid to come forward for years? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=568.14s)]
*  Correct. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=571.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was really afraid to come forward, but I'm no longer afraid. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=572.3399999999999s)]
*  They will not silence me. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=577.4599999999999s)]
*  It's something that Colombia has the power of doing, believe that they have the power [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=578.78s)]
*  of doing, but they don't. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=583.4599999999999s)]
*  And I will continue to use my voice to hold them accountable, regardless of my status. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=586.4599999999999s)]
*  I wanted to ask Anthony DiPietro to talk about the evolution of this case, how you got involved [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=592.46s)]
*  and the numbers of people that have come forward. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=603.5s)]
*  Again, Anthony cannot hear Juan, but Juan asked how many people were involved, how many [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=607.9000000000001s)]
*  women survivors, how did you get involved in this case? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=615.86s)]
*  So to date, our firm has represented 808 women who have come forward to report on being sexually [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=619.34s)]
*  exploited and abused by Robert Haddon at Columbia University. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=628.42s)]
*  The really tragic part of this is that the university knew all the way back into the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=633.5799999999999s)]
*  90s about what he was doing and how he was mistreating patients, but did nothing but [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=641.02s)]
*  lie, cover it up and expose more unsuspecting patients to a known serial predator. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=647.58s)]
*  But explain, I mean, actually, you have achieved, altogether with your settlements, over a billion [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=654.7800000000001s)]
*  dollars, Columbia University, and you can explain the different medical institutions [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=662.46s)]
*  where he worked, Columbia Presbyterian, representing people like Evelyn Yang, who is the wife of [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=667.9000000000001s)]
*  the presidential candidate, everyone learning from everyone else, women who came forward. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=675.74s)]
*  Explain how that were over a billion dollars Columbia is paying out. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=683.2199999999999s)]
*  What did they not do? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=687.26s)]
*  When did they know that he was a predator? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=689.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so Columbia knew all the way back into 1995 when a patient wrote a letter to their [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=693.06s)]
*  chairman and who wrote back. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=700.5s)]
*  He acknowledged receipt of the letter. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=702.8199999999999s)]
*  He wrote to the chairman, risk management, and the hospital itself, and they did nothing [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=704.22s)]
*  except cover this up. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=709.26s)]
*  And the reason why these cases are so important is if you look at what happened at Columbia [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=710.78s)]
*  with Haddon, at Wow Cornell with Darius Paduk, at Michigan with Larry Nassar, USC with George [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=716.3000000000001s)]
*  Tindal, UCLA with James Heaps, the one thing these institutions have in common is that [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=723.78s)]
*  the institutions always know the abuse is happening. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=731.3s)]
*  So it's important that we make them, we hold them accountable. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=737.4599999999999s)]
*  We hit them where it hurts because the only thing they really care about, and they've [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=742.62s)]
*  shown this again and again, is their money and their reputation. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=746.38s)]
*  And so it's really important that they understand that we're here, we're watching them, and [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=750.3199999999999s)]
*  we're going to hold them accountable if they don't take proper action. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=754.8199999999999s)]
*  Can you explain something? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=758.24s)]
*  This is not only about Columbia, it's also about the Manhattan DA, who was Cyrus Vance [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=759.54s)]
*  at the time. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=764.02s)]
*  It is astounding the deal they made with him. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=766.02s)]
*  And explain that. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=771.2199999999999s)]
*  It's outrageous. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=772.6999999999999s)]
*  So in 2016, over 20 women had come forward to report the abuse to the district attorney's [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=773.6999999999999s)]
*  office in New York City. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=780.66s)]
*  That included a fellow employee of Robert Haddon's, an employee of Columbia University. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=782.4599999999999s)]
*  They indicted him for six women. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=787.78s)]
*  The district attorney's office then allowed Haddon to pick any two of the six women that [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=789.98s)]
*  he wanted, plead guilty to them. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=796.3s)]
*  One of them he made oral contact with, another one of them he forcibly assaulted. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=798.98s)]
*  And they gave him what more closely resembles an early paid retirement instead of a sentence [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=803.62s)]
*  for a sexual felon. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=808.98s)]
*  No jail, no fine, no community service. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=810.62s)]
*  They didn't even take his license. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=813.78s)]
*  They allowed him to surrender his medical license. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=815.14s)]
*  And no jail at that time. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=819.18s)]
*  What caused him to go to jail? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=820.78s)]
*  Not a thing. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=822.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm convinced it is the collective voices of all these women who have come forward, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=823.3199999999999s)]
*  who would continue to talk about this. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=828.34s)]
*  This case started back before, you know, the term Me Too was in the public consciousness, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=830.14s)]
*  before anyone heard of Nassar unless they were a patient of his being abused by him. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=835.22s)]
*  The dialogue kept going and growing and the movement kept gaining power. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=840.3000000000001s)]
*  Ultimately, it was the letter that was found in Utah from Columbia's chairman who apologized [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=845.26s)]
*  to the patient in 1995 for being assaulted. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=852.98s)]
*  And he told her he was going to take care of this when he got back from vacation and [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=855.9s)]
*  never did a thing except cover it up and expose more people. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=859.5s)]
*  And ultimately, when those reports started gaining traction, that seems to be when the [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=863.02s)]
*  federal prosecutor stepped in, indicted him again, and now he's in prison for what hopefully [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=867.66s)]
*  will be the rest of his life. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=872.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=874.18s)]
*  And I wanted to ask Eva and maybe Anthony DiPietro could also talk about this. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=875.18s)]
*  What kind of long-term changes has Columbia agreed to that you think are most important? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=881.4599999999999s)]
*  I think they haven't agreed to anything other than the settlement. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=891.18s)]
*  They haven't done anything other than cover up this abuse for many, many years. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=895.6999999999999s)]
*  Maybe they have offered a patient safety clinic, something like that, but nothing has really [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=902.06s)]
*  happened. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=907.78s)]
*  We are in conversations with the attorney general's office to see how we are going to [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=908.78s)]
*  have institutional accountability, because again, this cannot just stay on a settlement [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=912.42s)]
*  offer payment because they have all the money to continue to pay abuse as much as they many [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=917.3s)]
*  more years. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=922.3399999999999s)]
*  What is going to happen in each clinic and each hospital to make sure that this doesn't [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=923.5s)]
*  happen again? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=927.82s)]
*  They have yet to say that, and we are waiting for them to come forward and say how that's [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=928.94s)]
*  going to look like. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=933.5400000000001s)]
*  You, many people are getting Robert Haddon's name off your child's birth certificate? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=934.5400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=940.34s)]
*  That's part of the deal. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=941.34s)]
*  And for Eva, you now have three kids. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=943.5400000000001s)]
*  You're DACA. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=947.38s)]
*  You talked with me earlier about how your mother was your support but also feels guilty [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=949.74s)]
*  about not speaking out earlier. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=954.18s)]
*  What message you have to young, vulnerable people who are terrified to come forward yet [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=957.3s)]
*  know and you knew from that moment in your greatest pain around delivery that there was [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=963.18s)]
*  something really bad happening here? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=968.74s)]
*  I would say more than anything to trust yourself. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=971.78s)]
*  Trust yourself once you have that feeling that something is wrong. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=975.48s)]
*  I knew it since the first moment that he did it, and I've been holding it ever since. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=978.62s)]
*  And it's just a matter of trusting yourself and using the people around you and your community [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=983.62s)]
*  to be supported and come forward and know that you have the protection, you have the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=988.62s)]
*  resources, you have great lawyers like Anthony DiPietro that will support you along the way [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=993.62s)]
*  and great collective sisters that like I found that has made this journey easier or else [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=998.62s)]
*  I would have been really alone throughout this time. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1006.66s)]
*  These are the largest settlements in U.S. history, well over a billion dollars vying [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1012.66s)]
*  with USC, University of Southern California, Anthony. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1017.66s)]
*  Yes, that's correct. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1020.66s)]
*  Women, the average that they'll be getting is? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1022.66s)]
*  Just over $1.3 million on a per case average, which is the highest amount. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1026.66s)]
*  And the number of women who are involved at this point? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1031.66s)]
*  576 in this current round. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1034.7s)]
*  Can other women come forward now that we'll hear this? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1036.7s)]
*  Yeah, so each case is going to have to be evaluated on an individual basis. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1039.7s)]
*  You know, the work that everyone has done so far in passing a law called the Adult [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1044.7s)]
*  Survivors Act, passing a law called the New York Gender Motivated Violence Act, those [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1049.7s)]
*  statutes provided a temporary timeframe for people to come forward, file a case, even [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1055.7s)]
*  those beyond the statute of limitations. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1060.74s)]
*  Those have now ended, but there still could be opportunities for people to come forward [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1063.74s)]
*  on an individual basis. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1067.74s)]
*  And finally, Laurie, your final comment as this chapter comes to an end. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1069.74s)]
*  Robert Haddon in jail, Columbia and the hospital being held accountable. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1076.74s)]
*  Your son is 17 years old. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1082.74s)]
*  You were assaulted few days before he was born. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1085.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think this again, this is like a big win for us, just like Haddon being convicted. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1088.78s)]
*  But when we were when we were in court with Haddon, you know, he was put in handcuffs [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1095.78s)]
*  and taken to jail. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1102.78s)]
*  And we were assured that he would, you know, never harm anybody again. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1103.78s)]
*  And that was the end of that. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1108.78s)]
*  But there was nobody in the courtroom representing Columbia. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1109.78s)]
*  And still to this day, they haven't done much, you know, in terms of hearing our voices, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1113.82s)]
*  in terms of making internal changes, in terms of external investigation. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1120.82s)]
*  And that's what we're trying to put forth. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1126.82s)]
*  And so, you know, my hope is holding Columbia accountable to that same level. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1128.82s)]
*  And that is really a lot of I feel like survivors are a force to be reckoned with. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1133.82s)]
*  We are a strong group. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1139.86s)]
*  We do a lot of incredible things. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1142.86s)]
*  And one of the things that Eva was really highlighting was, you know, our work with [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1144.86s)]
*  attorney general's office. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1149.86s)]
*  Like if, you know, we know if we want Columbia to change that it's survivors that need to [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1150.86s)]
*  hold them to accountable. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1156.86s)]
*  So we're really, you know, so this is huge. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1157.86s)]
*  And at the same time, we have lots of work to do to make sure that this never happens [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1160.86s)]
*  at this scale again. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1165.8999999999999s)]
*  Laurie Maldonado, Eva Santos-Velos and their attorney, Anthony T. DiPietro, representing [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1168.8999999999999s)]
*  hundreds of women who were sexually abused by Dr. Robert Haddon now in jail for decades. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viniCZanVtI&t=1175.8999999999999s)]
