*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israeli military jets bombarded southern Lebanon Thursday, while Hezbollah struck sites in
*  northern Israel after mass walkie-talkie and pager explosions Tuesday and Wednesday killed
*  at least 37 people in Lebanon and injured thousands more in what's widely believed
*  to be a coordinated attack by Israel.
*  Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah accused Israel of crossing all red lines as he addressed
*  the week's attacks in televised remarks Thursday.
*  War crimes or a declaration of war, you can call it anything, and it deserves those words.
*  Undoubtedly, we have been subjected to a major attack in terms of security and humanitarian
*  aspects unprecedented in the history of resistance in Lebanon.
*  We say to the enemy's government, army and society that the Lebanese front will not stop
*  before the aggression on Gaza stops.
*  Despite the widely condemned attacks on Lebanon, Israel's doubling down on its intent to
*  expand its war on Lebanon.
*  This is the Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant.
*  Over the past several days, we have held a series of important discussions.
*  This is a new phase of the war.
*  It includes opportunities, but also significant risks.
*  Hezbollah feels it is being persecuted, and the sequence of military and defense actions
*  will continue.
*  U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has postponed a trip to Israel early next week amidst the
*  Associated Press reports.
*  Gallant warned Austin, head of the attacks this week, that Israel was launching a military
*  operation in Lebanon but did not give any more details.
*  Deadly Israeli raids are continuing in the occupied West Bank, including in Jenin and
*  Kabatia, where a video has been circulating showing Israeli soldiers pushing dead bodies
*  off a roof after a raid that killed at least five Palestinians.
*  The desecration of corpses is considered a war crime, but Palestinians say the Israeli
*  military frequently violates the deceased bodies of its victims.
*  During the Kabatia raid, Israeli forces also opened fire on a group of journalists filming
*  the events.
*  This is an eyewitness.
*  Israeli special forces, fully equipped, raided and surrounded the area.
*  They started shooting grenades and missiles.
*  They struck young men at our place on the rooftop as they were trying to escape the
*  trap.
*  Israeli attacks on Gaza have also continued, with deaths reported over the past day in
*  Gaza City, Jabalia, Nusayrat and Bet Hanoun.
*  The official death toll in Gaza since October 7th has topped 41,000, with nearly 100,000
*  wounded, though the true toll is certainly much higher.
*  A U.N. committee on Thursday accused Israel of engaging in unprecedented violations of
*  the Convention on the Rights of the Child over the past 11 months.
*  More children have died in this war than men or women.
*  That is massive.
*  And I think when we think about it and we know that under international humanitarian law
*  that Israel admits it is bound by, killing of civilian targets on this scale is unacceptable
*  in international humanitarian law and international human rights law as well.
*  And children are always civilians.
*  Here in the U.S., three Democratic lawmakers Thursday introduced a bill that would restore
*  emergency funding to the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, after the U.S. suspended
*  its contributions and in January and later passed a bill barring any further funding
*  of UNRWA until March of next year.
*  Resistance to Israel's U.S.-backed war on Gaza continues on college campuses as the
*  new school year gets underway, with more protests and calls to divest from Israel.
*  On Wednesday, Cornell University students shut down a career fair featuring weapons
*  manufacturers supplying Israel's war on Gaza.
*  Meanwhile, a chapter of the activist group Students for Justice in Palestine is suing
*  the University of Maryland in College Park after the school canceled an October 7th Gaza
*  vigil.
*  In campaign news, Donald Trump said Thursday Jewish voters would be to blame if he loses
*  November's election.
*  Trump made the remarks at an event by the Israel-American Council titled Fighting Antisemitism
*  in America.
*  The Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss if I'm at 40 percent.
*  If I'm at 40, think of it.
*  That means 60 percent are voting for Kamala, who in particular is a bad Democrat.
*  The Democrats are bad to Israel, very bad.
*  I mean, Chuck Schumer is a Palestinian.
*  North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson, a Trump-supported, transbashing Republican
*  gubernatorial candidate, referred to himself as a black Nazi and expressed support for
*  reinstating slavery.
*  That's according to CNN, which reports Robinson made the remarks over a decade ago on Nude
*  Africa, a pornographic website.
*  CNN also found Robinson called Martin Luther King Jr. quote, worse than a maggot, repeatedly
*  used anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim slurs and said he enjoyed watching transgender pornography.
*  Robinson has a long history of backing anti-transgender legislation.
*  On Thursday, Robinson denied CNN's report.
*  Let me reassure you, the things that you will see in that story, those are not the words
*  of Mark Robinson.
*  While many have called for Robinson to drop out of the race, he has vowed to remain.
*  A former longtime CIA officer has been sentenced to 30 years in federal prison for sexual assault.
*  Over 14 years in the CIA, Brian Jeffrey Raymond drugged, photographed and assaulted women
*  he met while stationed in various countries.
*  Disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein pleaded not guilty to a new sex crime charge
*  in New York this week.
*  Weinstein, who's been accused of rape and sexual assault by over 80 survivors, is currently
*  awaiting retrial after a 2020 rape conviction was overturned.
*  He was separately convicted in 2022 in a Los Angeles rape case and remains behind bars.
*  Earlier this week, a federal judge in California dismissed a sex trafficking and sexual assault
*  lawsuit against Weinstein and Madison Square Garden Chief Executive James Dolan.
*  In the United Kingdom, five women have accused the billionaire former owner of the Harrods
*  department store of rape.
*  Others accused Mohammed Al-Fayad of sexual assault and harassment while they worked at
*  his luxury department store in London.
*  The revelations came as part of the new BBC documentary Al-Fayad, Predator at Harrods.
*  Mohammed Al-Fayad died last year at the age of 94.
*  Meanwhile, France has been gripped by the horrific case of a serial rape survivor Gisele
*  Pellicote as it plays out in open court.
*  71-year-old Gisele Pellicote's husband Dominique Pellicote confessed on The Stand this week
*  that he recruited dozens of men for over a decade to rape his wife after drugging her
*  so she was unconscious.
*  The case has roiled France as throngs of people have come out to show their support for Gisele
*  Pellicote during the trial.
*  I would like to tell Gisele that we hear her words.
*  I am here to speak for the victims, to tell them that we are listening to them, we will
*  fight for them, that the impunity of men is over.
*  Gisele Pellicote chose to reveal her name and have a public trial in order to give a
*  voice to other survivors.
*  In climate news, the World Meteorological Organization warns the globe is on track to
*  exceed 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, likely bringing about widespread
*  climate catastrophe.
*  2023 was the warmest year on record by a huge margin.
*  Leading international data sets say that the first eight months of 2024 are also the warmest
*  on record.
*  There is an 80 percent chance that the global mean near surface temperature will temporarily
*  exceed 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels at least one of the next five calendar years.
*  In more climate news, severe flooding from heavy rains in West and Central Africa has
*  affected 4 million people, with nearly 1 million people left homeless.
*  More than 30 people are dead in northeastern Nigeria after a dam ruptured and caused floodwaters
*  to sweep across the city of Mitaguri.
*  Heavy groups say 150,000 children are in displacement camps, with many disconnected
*  from their families and no access to drinking water.
*  A record number of wildfires have been recorded across South America this year, surpassing
*  the prior record set in 2017.
*  Smoke recently blanketed up to 60 percent of the skies above Brazil, choking major cities
*  like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
*  In Budapest, Hungary, the Danube has overflowed its banks after heavy rains pushed the river
*  to its highest level in more than a decade.
*  On Thursday, the European Union committed billions of euros to aid recovery efforts
*  after the worst floods to central Europe in at least two decades killed at least two dozen
*  people and destroyed homes and infrastructure from Romania to Poland.
*  Meanwhile, Portugal's government has declared a state of calamity.
*  As more than 100 wildfires continue to rage, at least seven people have died in the fires.
*  Back in the United States, in Tennessee, a federal trial is underway for three former
*  Memphis police officers charged over the killing of Tyree Nichols, a 29-year-old black father
*  who was beaten to death following a traffic stop in January of 2023.
*  On Thursday, prosecutors showed the jury disturbing body cam video showing officers Tidarius Bean,
*  Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith milling around and failing to render medical aid to Tyree
*  who was slumped on the ground after he was brutally punched, kicked, tased and pepper
*  sprayed by the officers.
*  Nichols died three days later.
*  The officers are charged with violating Nichols' civil rights, failure to intervene and obstruction
*  of justice for conspiring to cover up the killing.
*  They also face murder charges in a Tennessee state court.
*  Two other officers, Emmett Martin and Desmond Mills Jr., pleaded guilty to federal civil
*  rights charges ahead of the trial.
*  The Justice Department has launched a civil rights probe into the Mississippi Sheriff's
*  Department that was home to the self-described Goon Squad.
*  The six white deputies were convicted for raiding a home and torturing two black men.
*  You can see our coverage of this case at democracynow.org.
*  In Kentucky, Letcher County Sheriff Sean Steins was arrested Thursday and charged with first-degree
*  murder for fatally shooting District Judge Kevin Mullins after an argument in the judge's
*  chambers.
*  Authorities say they're still investigating a motive in the sheriff killing the judge.
*  And housing justice advocates celebrated the introduction this week of the Homes Act by
*  Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Tina Smith.
*  The social housing proposal would establish a federally backed development authority charged
*  with financing union-built, energy-efficient homes across the U.S. where rent would be
*  capped at 25 percent of household income.
*  The units would remain permanently affordable by keeping them out of the hands of corporate
*  landlords, prioritizing cooperative and land trust models instead.
*  The homes would benefit those most affected by the housing crisis, including unhoused
*  people, people of color, low-income families, single mothers and immigrants.
