Longtime immigrant farmworker and organizer Alfredo "Lelo" Juarez Zeferino was pulled over last week by a plainclothes agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in an unmarked car who broke his car window and forcibly detained him. "Within not even a minute of interaction, of getting pulled over, he was already in handcuffs," says Edgar Franks, the political director of independent farmworkers union, Familias Unidas por la Justicia, which he co-founded with Lelo. "The reason of his detainment was because of how politically active he was." Lelo is currently jailed at the privately run Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington, where hundreds have rallied in support of his release.

# Washington Farmworker Organizer Detained in Trump Immigration Crackdown
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=3.48s)]
*  We look now at how the crackdown on asylum seekers and immigrants under the Trump administration [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=4.76s)]
*  is targeting labor activists, including the beloved immigrant farmworker organizer Alfredo [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=9.68s)]
*  Juarez, also known as Lalo. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=15.24s)]
*  Supporters say he was kidnapped when agents with ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=18.0s)]
*  stopped him on a rural road as he drove his girlfriend to her job on a tulip bulb farm [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  early in the morning of March 25. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=29.54s)]
*  When he asked for a warrant, the agents reportedly broke his car window and handcuffed him. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=32.18s)]
*  Lalo is now jailed at the privately run Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, where hundreds [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=38.22s)]
*  have rallied to call for his release. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=44.06s)]
*  He picks strawberries for a living. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  Democracy Now! spoke to Lalo in 2016, when he was a 16-year-old farmworker in Burlington, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=48.94s)]
*  Washington. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=57.3s)]
*  One of the challenges that comes during summer was that sometimes I have to leave school [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=59.18s)]
*  early, I don't get to finish school. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=64.46s)]
*  I remember that one day, I think it was a Sunday, when we were picking strawberries, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=66.53999999999999s)]
*  it was rainy, and then it was like super cold, like the wind and stuff like that, and I was [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=72.94s)]
*  kind of feeling a little sick. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=78.3s)]
*  It was like around 12, and I wanted to go home, so I asked my mom, and then she said, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=79.3s)]
*  if I'm not feeling well, we should go home. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=85.5s)]
*  And then my mom told the supervisor, but my supervisor said, like, if you guys don't [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=90.26s)]
*  get back to work, go home. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=95.54s)]
*  You guys will get fired, and then you have to find some place to live, like, just like [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=96.54s)]
*  right away. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  Like, at the same day you get fired, and then you have to find a place to stay. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  So that was Alfredo Lalo Corazón, Democracy Now! in 2016, when he was 16 years old. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=106.94s)]
*  In 2013, he helped found Familias Unidas por la Justicia, an independent farmworkers' [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=115.62s)]
*  union in Washington state, with his friend Edgar Franks, who's joining us in a minute. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=121.66s)]
*  Edgar recorded this more recent video of Lalo in a strawberry field. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=126.14s)]
*  Let's try your best. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=130.46s)]
*  This is how they want it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=132.18s)]
*  Yeah, so usually you grab your bucket, you throw it in, you grab another one, another [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=133.18s)]
*  little plant. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=139.1s)]
*  Like right here, you grab this one. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=140.1s)]
*  Finish it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=143.1s)]
*  Grab another one. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=145.18s)]
*  And that's how you go. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=147.18s)]
*  Nice. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=149.18s)]
*  Today, Lalo has a hearing in his case. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=150.18s)]
*  For more, we're joined by Edgar Franks, the political director of Families United [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=154.85999999999999s)]
*  for Justice, Familias Unidas por la Justicia. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=159.88s)]
*  Welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=163.9s)]
*  You've known Lalo for at least a decade, since he was, what, 14 years old. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=165.26s)]
*  Edgar, tell us what happened last week. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, good morning and thank you for having us here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=174.46s)]
*  Yeah, I've grown, I've seen Lalo grow up and it was really shocking to hear the details [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=177.46s)]
*  about what happened to him. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=185.9s)]
*  It was around 7.30 in the morning and he was doing what he usually does during this time [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=188.38s)]
*  of year, driving his partner to go work. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=195.5s)]
*  Right now, the work that's available is working in tulip fields. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=201.66s)]
*  He was driving and no less than a couple miles from his home, he was pulled over, you know, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=207.74s)]
*  an unmarked car and he saw a gentleman approaching his vehicle. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=217.7s)]
*  He cracked the window of his car a couple of inches and when the people showed up to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=225.26s)]
*  near his window, you know, he asked, why am I getting pulled over and do you have a warrant? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=232.06s)]
*  The people asked for his ID and as soon as he was going to reach for his wallet to pull [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=238.82s)]
*  out his license, they broke his driver's side, passenger side window. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=243.14s)]
*  And he got out of the car, his partner was upset, so he didn't want to get more fear [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=252.94s)]
*  in her, so he stepped out and within a couple of, not even a minute of interaction of getting [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=261.3s)]
*  pulled over, he was already in handcuffs. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=267.34s)]
*  So he was taken to Ferndale at a holding station with Border Patrol, Ferndale, Washington and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=269.38s)]
*  a couple of hours later he was transferred to Tacoma and the Northwest Detention Center. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=277.22s)]
*  So you know, he's been there ever since, so we're hopefully, you know, can do something [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=283.22s)]
*  to get him out. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=290.98s)]
*  And talk about the significance of this hearing today. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=292.86s)]
*  What's being demanded? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=295.78000000000003s)]
*  Yes, so ICE had a statement that they said that Alfredo had a deportation order since [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=297.82000000000005s)]
*  March 2018, which Lelo had never, you know, got a letter or a call. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=305.18s)]
*  He never had mentioned it to us ever. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=311.9s)]
*  You know, he's a pretty honest person, so if there was something like that, he would [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=313.86s)]
*  definitely have shown up to his court date. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=318.7s)]
*  But today his lawyers, his immigration lawyers, are going to go and present a motion to see [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=321.06s)]
*  if they can reopen his case and fight the deportation removal. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=332.48s)]
*  I believe a couple of days ago he was already in line to get on an airplane to be deported [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  back to Mexico. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=344.52000000000004s)]
*  And when he was in line, he was actually pulled out by agents and said that his lawyers already [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=347.04s)]
*  had filed or had asked, seeked a hearing with a judge. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  Today is that day, this—we don't know what time today, this Friday, but, you know, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  it's a very emotional, very tense day because, you know, the term—whatever the judge says, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  you know, it has a lot to do with his case. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=373.44s)]
*  You know, and he's committed to fight this case, you know, and hopefully he gets freed. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=376.32s)]
*  And can you also talk about—he's not only Mexican, he's indigenous, he's Mixteco. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=382.76s)]
*  The issue of having language and resource accessibility so that indigenous workers can [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=389.32s)]
*  organize, and do you believe this is one of the reasons he's being targeted right now? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=396.0s)]
*  We believe so. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=402.4s)]
*  We believe that the reason of his detainment was because of how politically active he was [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=403.4s)]
*  in bettering the lives of not only of farm workers, immigrants, but especially the Mixteco [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=412.56s)]
*  community that he comes from. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=419.2s)]
*  He's one of the few organizers in the state that speaks Mixteco English and Spanish, so, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=421.96s)]
*  you know, he can communicate with thousands of workers here. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=428.48s)]
*  And you know, the proof is just in how successful the union has been. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=433.0s)]
*  You know, we passed overtime, got paid rest breaks, passed rules for heat and smoke rules. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  Alfredo had a lot to do because he's not only still working in farms when he's not organizing, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=445.76s)]
*  he has direct contact and is always talking to workers about what are the needs in our [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=452.56s)]
*  community. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=457.6s)]
*  So, you know, for whatever gains we've made in the last couple of years, Alfredo has been [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=458.6s)]
*  and especially because of how, you know, since he's been a young man, has been connected [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=465.68s)]
*  to the Mixteco community, which is a huge part of our farm worker community. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=470.12s)]
*  And it's not the first time he's been arrested and detained. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=474.8s)]
*  When he was 15 years old, Bellingham police racially profiled him, pulled him over, detained [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=477.72s)]
*  him, even though he had DACA. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=483.68s)]
*  Yeah, he was pulled over, you know, like any other teen, you know, for driving without [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=487.32s)]
*  a license. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=494.8s)]
*  A local police officer from the city of Bellingham questioned him and was asking for like social [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=496.28000000000003s)]
*  security and where he really was from. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=503.72s)]
*  And within minutes of him being pulled over on a traffic stop, he was sent to, again, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=507.28s)]
*  to Tacoma when he was still a minor, when he was 15 years old. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=513.72s)]
*  Luckily, we, some organizers, were able to locate him and let the detention center know [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=519.04s)]
*  that they had a minor on their hands and he was released. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=527.04s)]
*  But yeah, it was an incident of racial profiling. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=530.96s)]
*  I want to also ask you about the ICE agents raiding the Mount Baker Roofing Company in [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=534.56s)]
*  Bellingham, Washington state, early Wednesday, arresting at least 37 immigrant workers. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=539.52s)]
*  This is a Facebook Live video that captured the raid recorded by Giovanna Perez Juarez, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=545.28s)]
*  whose nephew, Jose Manuel, was one of the detained workers. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=551.44s)]
*  The raid happened when they were about to start their shift. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=555.44s)]
*  They're in unmarked cars. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=563.8s)]
*  They're in vehicles that don't have an ICE logo or anything. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=565.64s)]
*  They are being processed in the warehouse over there. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=569.52s)]
*  And from the warehouse, they are being escorted to the bus. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=572.16s)]
*  They are loading more people up in the bus. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=577.76s)]
*  It is so sad to witness this. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=579.92s)]
*  Being here is sad. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=581.8399999999999s)]
*  Watching how they take away hard-working people. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=585.16s)]
*  Can you comment on this raid as we wrap up? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=589.4s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's very, again, unfortunate. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=594.84s)]
*  Where were they taken? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=599.6s)]
*  Where was that? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=601.6s)]
*  They were taken to the same detention facility where Lalo is right now? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=603.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=607.84s)]
*  Yeah, these, you know, I think right now what we're seeing is an attack on not only immigrants, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=608.84s)]
*  but we think this is an attack also on workers. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpMcz3JAho&t=615.08s)]
