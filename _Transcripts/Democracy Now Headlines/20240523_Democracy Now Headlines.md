*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel is intensifying its ground and aerial attacks on the southern Gaza city of Ra'a,
*  where until recently more than 1.4 million Palestinians had sought refuge.
*  According to the United Nations, over 800,000 Palestinians have fled Ra'a, despite having
*  no safe place to go.
*  In Gaza City, Israel bombed a mosque and a school, housing displaced Palestinians.
*  Al Jazeera reports the bombing killed 10 people, including five children.
*  Dozens were wounded.
*  The overall death toll in Gaza has now topped 35,700.
*  Israel is also continuing to target medical facilities in Gaza.
*  Israeli forces have stormed Al-Ata Hospital and the Jabalya refugee camp, forcing medical
*  staff to abandon the hospital.
*  The World Health Organization has issued an urgent appeal for Israel to protect the hospital's
*  medical staff and patients.
*  On Tuesday, Israeli missiles struck the emergency department at Kamel Adwan Hospital in northern
*  Gaza.
*  Dr. Hossam Abu Safiha described the attack.
*  HOSSAM ABU SAFIHA, Israeli Defense Minister, Gaza City
*  What happened a short while ago, and we never imagined that one day we would be targeted
*  directly, the emergency department was targeted by more than three missiles.
*  The first missile, when it hit, it hit the entrance of the emergency department.
*  We tried to enter, and then a second missile hit.
*  And then the third, in the building nearby, was hit.
*  We do not know what their fate is.
*  On Capitol Hill, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is moving ahead with a plan to
*  invite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress.
*  Johnson's urging Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to sign on to the invitation,
*  despite strong pushback from many Democrats.
*  This comes just days after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced
*  he's seeking an arrest warrant for Netanyahu for war crimes in Gaza.
*  Meanwhile, Israel and the U.S. are criticizing a move by Ireland, Norway and Spain to recognize
*  Palestine as an independent state, May 28, bringing the total number of countries recognizing
*  Palestine to 146.
*  National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke Wednesday.
*  JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. Secretary of State for the United States of America
*  President Biden, as I just said, has been on the record supporting a two-state solution.
*  He has been equally emphatic on the record that that two-state solution should be brought
*  about through direct negotiations through the parties, not through unilateral recognition.
*  In Colombia, President Gustavo Petro has ordered the opening of a Colombian embassy in the
*  Palestinian city of Ramallah and the occupied West Bank.
*  This comes weeks after Petro broke diplomatic relations with Israel after accused Israel
*  of committing genocide in Gaza.
*  This is Colombia's foreign minister, Luis Gilberto Murillo.
*  LUIS GILBERTO MURILLO, Colombian Foreign Minister
*  We believe, we are sure, that more and more countries are going to recognize Palestine,
*  and this is nothing against Israel or the people of Israel or Jewish people.
*  The United Nations agreed, in the context of the Oslo Accords, that a two-state solution
*  should be created.
*  And so, if you need two states, then obviously that requires Palestine to be recognized as
*  a state.
*  AMY GOODMAN, U.S. Secretary of State for the United States of America
*  Back in the U.S., two progressive Democrats lost their primary races in Oregon Tuesday
*  after they were vastly outspent by more right-leaning candidates.
*  Sushila Jayapal, the older sister of congressional progressive caucus chair Pramila Jayapal,
*  lost to Maxine Dexter, who received around 30 times more money than Jayapal, including
*  over $2 million from the pro-Israel, AIPAC-affiliated 314 Action Fund.
*  Sushila Jayapal called for urgent campaign finance reform after the vote.
*  Elsewhere in Oregon, progressive candidate Jamie McLeod Skinner was defeated by Janelle
*  Bynum, who received nearly half a million dollars from 314 Action Fund.
*  China has launched two days of military drills around Taiwan, just days after the self-governing
*  territory inaugurated its new president.
*  Chinese state media said the military exercises will, quote, "...serve as a strong punishment
*  for the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces," unquote.
*  Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-teh responded to the news by saying he will strengthen
*  Taiwan's army, and, quote, "...continue to defend the values of democracy, protecting
*  regional peace and stability," unquote.
*  In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called a surprise snap election for
*  July 4, taking a major gamble as he seeks re-election, even as his conservative party
*  is trailing far behind the opposition Labour Party in the polls.
*  Conservatives have been in power in Britain since 2010.
*  In environmental news, an international maritime tribunal issued a ruling that says greenhouse
*  gases are pollutants that can cause irreversible harm to the marine environment, and governments
*  must, quote, "...adopt laws and regulations to prevent, reduce and control them."
*  Though the ruling is nonbinding, small island nations on the front lines of the climate
*  crisis hailed it as a groundbreaking victory, and it's likely to lead to more cases against
*  the largest polluters.
*  The decision affects 165 countries that ratified the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.
*  The United States is not one of them.
*  In Florida, a federal judge temporarily blocked part of a new law that would make it a felony
*  to transport undocumented migrants into the state.
*  The measure was pushed as part of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' attacks on immigrants.
*  Meanwhile, in Arizona, the state Senate advanced a Republican-led ballot measure for the November
*  election, which would allow local and state agencies to detain undocumented people crossing
*  the southern border and allow state judges to order their removal from the U.S. Arizona
*  Democrats and immigrant justice advocates have condemned the measure for further criminalizing
*  migrants.
*  This is Jose Patino of the group Aliento.
*  Myself, my dad was deported when I was 11 years old.
*  I remember to this day how I felt scared in the corner asking for help and how the people
*  who were supposed to protect us, okay, police officers, were the ones that were the ones
*  who were taking my dad away.
*  Another flag favored by diehard Trump supporters was seen on display outside another one of
*  Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's homes.
*  The New York Times reports the an appeal to heaven flag, a symbol carried by insurrectionists
*  on January 6, was photographed flying in front of Alito's New Jersey vacation house
*  last summer.
*  The flag, featuring a pine tree, is found in far-right Christian circles.
*  This comes just a week after the New York Times reported Alito flew an upside-down U.S.
*  flag outside his Virginia home January 2021, a symbol used by election deniers.
*  Even before Wednesday's latest revelation, some 50 House Democrats wrote a letter calling
*  on Justice Alito to recuse himself from January 6 related cases, including Trump's claim
*  to presidential immunity in his election subversion cases.
*  The an appeal to heaven flag also hangs outside the office of House Speaker Mike Johnson.
*  The Senate on Wednesday confirmed President Biden's 201st federal judge nominee.
*  At this point in Trump's presidency, Republicans had secured 196 judges.
*  Democrats hope to exceed Trump's total of 234 judicial confirmations during his term,
*  which would represent about a quarter of the federal judiciary.
*  In Uvalde, Texas, families of the victims of the massacre at Robb Elementary School
*  announced they've settled a lawsuit with the city for $2 million as they launched a
*  lawsuit against 92 officers with the Texas Department of Public Safety, the school district
*  and individual employees.
*  This is Javier Cazares, father of killed 9-year-old Jackie, speaking at a press conference yesterday.
*  No amount of money is worth our lives or our children.
*  Justice and accountability has always been my main concern.
*  We've been let down so many times.
*  The time has come to do the right thing.
*  Thank you.
*  News Wednesday came just two days ahead of the two-year anniversary of the Uvalde massacre,
*  which killed 19 children and two teachers.
*  376 law enforcement officers responded to mass shooting, but it took 77 minutes for
*  anyone to enter the classroom where the gunman was slaughtering children.
*  Earlier this week, the new Uvalde school district police chief resigned.
*  Just a year after taking up the job, his predecessor was fired over the botched response to the
*  shooting.
*  President Biden has canceled another $7.7 billion in student loans for 160,000 borrowers.
*  The funds will benefit those enrolled in certain repayment plans, such as public service loans
*  and income-driven plans.
*  This latest move brings the overall student debt relief issued by the Biden administration
*  to $167 billion, after the Supreme Court struck down a more comprehensive plan last year that
*  would have provided relief for some 40 million people.
*  And in related news, a dozen members of the debt collective group were arrested Wednesday
*  after 100 protesters marched from the Education Department to the Capitol demanding Biden
*  fund education, not genocide, unquote.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
