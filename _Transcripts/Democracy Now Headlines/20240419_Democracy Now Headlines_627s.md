# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” April 19, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE0ij_AXKIk)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel launched a drone attack on Iran, according to Israeli and Iranian sources.
*  Tehran said the strike hit a military air base near the city of Isfahan, where explosions
*  could be heard.
*  The damage was reportedly minimal, and Iranian forces later downed three Israeli drones.
*  The attack early this morning came in response to Iran's recent drone and missile attack
*  on Israel.
*  It comes less than three weeks after Israel attacked an Iranian consulate in Damascus,
*  Syria, killing many people, including senior military officials.
*  About a dozen people were killed.
*  There were early reports of possible strikes inside Syria and Iraq as well, but those have
*  not been confirmed.
*  Earlier Thursday, the U.S. announced new sanctions on Iran, targeting its missile and drone programs
*  and various military entities and individuals.
*  The EU and the U.K. are also imposing new sanctions against Iran.
*  Meanwhile, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a G7 meeting in Italy earlier today
*  that the U.S. was not involved in any offensive operation by Israel, though it's reported
*  the U.S. received advance notice of the Israeli attack on Iran.
*  Riot police moved in on a peaceful student protest encampment arresting at least 108
*  people at Columbia.
*  Columbia University President Manu Shafik called the NYPD to clear the Gaza Solidarity
*  encampment on the campus' south lawn, where Columbia and Barnard students had set up one
*  day earlier to demand university leadership divest from Israel.
*  New York Police Chief John Schell said Shafik identified the demonstration as a clear and
*  present danger, but that officers found the students to be peaceful and cooperative.
*  Shafik warned all students participating in the encampment would be suspended if arrested.
*  At least three suspensions of Barnard students were confirmed Thursday, including Isra Hirsi,
*  daughter of Congressmember Ilhan Omar.
*  Columbia students and faculty members held a news conference Thursday evening.
*  This is Palestinian-American graduate student Laila Saliba, who lost 14 family members in
*  Gaza since October 7th.
*  Laila Saliba was also one of the Columbia students attacked in January's chemical
*  skunk attack during a campus rally.
*  In yesterday's arrest, students continued to gather on campus, where large protests
*  carried on through the night and are ongoing.
*  Thursday's showdown with the NYPD was the largest arrest on the Columbia campus since
*  1968, when police apprehended over 700 students protesting the school's ties to the Vietnam
*  War and Columbia's plans to expand in Harlem by building a gymnasium in Morningside Park.
*  Meanwhile, on the other side of the country, massive crowds of students at the University
*  of Southern California protested USC's cancellation of valedictorian Asna Tabassum's graduation
*  speech, chanting, Let Her Speak.
*  This is student Katja Urban.
*  It feels really important, especially right now, for the Jewish voice at USC, the anti-Zionist
*  Jewish voice at USC, to be very loud and very present.
*  So we're here just to support Asna and to support free speech and to hold USC accountable.
*  To see our interview with the USC valedictorian, go to democracynow.org.
*  The United States was alone in vetoing a U.N. Security Council resolution Thursday recommending
*  Palestine's full membership at the United Nations.
*  The U.K. and Switzerland abstained.
*  All 12 other nation members voted in favor of Palestinian membership.
*  Palestine is currently a non-member observer.
*  Riyad Mansour, Palestinian ambassador to the U.N., said the result will translate to a
*  greater loss of life in Gaza.
*  He spoke after the vote.
*  Our right to self-determination has never once been subject to bargaining or negotiation.
*  Our right to self-determination is a natural right, a historic right, a legal right, a
*  right to live in our homeland, Palestine, as an independent state that is free and that
*  is sovereign.
*  More details have emerged about the death of Hind Rajab, the six-year-old girl in Gaza
*  City who was killed by Israeli forces in January in a car alongside five of her family members.
*  Prior to her death, Hind was on the phone with emergency workers pleading for help.
*  Two paramedics from the Palestinian Red Crescent who responded to her call were also killed
*  in their ambulance.
*  Israel denied responsibility for the killings by claiming its forces were not present.
*  But a new Washington Post investigation finds Israeli armored vehicles were in the vicinity
*  of the attack on Hind Rajab.
*  The Post also reveals the destroyed ambulance was discovered along a route provided by Israeli
*  authorities after the Palestine Red Crescent had received approval to respond.
*  The ambulance was bombed about 164 feet from the car with Hind and her family.
*  The Post reports the destruction of the ambulance was consistent with the use of a round fired
*  by Israeli tanks and that the gunfire audible on the phone call was consistent with Israel's
*  Israeli weapons.
*  A coalition of human rights advocates have arrived in Istanbul, Turkey as they prepare
*  to set sail to Gaza on a civilian flotilla carrying urgently needed food and medicine.
*  Hundreds will participate in the humanitarian aid mission.
*  The freedom flotilla is expected to set sail later this month.
*  This is Palestinian-American activist Weta Araf.
*  What we have on board is life-saving aid.
*  We are watching in horror as an entire people are being deliberately starved on top of the
*  bombings and the killings and the maiming that we have seen.
*  And we can't stand by because our governments aren't doing anything to stop it.
*  So we are taking to sea to attempt to deliver this aid and to directly challenge the siege
*  in hopes of breaking it.
*  Weta Araf was one of the organizers of the 2010 Gaza Freedom Flotilla, which is a real
*  attack killing 10 activists.
*  Lawmakers can soon take a decisive step in forcing TikTok to either be sold from its
*  Chinese owner Bike Dance or be banned in the U.S.
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson has attached the TikTok divest or ban measure to a series of
*  military funding bills for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, adding up to $95 billion.
*  Those lawmakers are expected to vote on all four bills by Saturday, which would then be
*  sent to the Senate as a single package.
*  This comes as The Wall Street Journal reports the Biden administration is weighing sending
*  another $1 billion in new weapons to Israel, including tank ammunition, military vehicles
*  and mortar rounds.
*  The U.S. deported over 70 Haitian asylum seekers Thursday despite a spiraling security and
*  humanitarian crisis in Haiti.
*  Haitian rights advocates have been demanding the Biden administration halt all deportation
*  flights to Haiti.
*  The Haitian Bridge Alliance said in a statement, quote, deportations to Haiti are intentional
*  violence and blatant anti-black discrimination.
*  The hypocrisy by the Biden-Harris administration must cease, they said.
*  Earlier this week, Haitian officials named the members of a transitional council that
*  will take power after Prime Minister Ariel Henry steps down.
*  The council, made up of voting members and non-voting observers, will choose a new prime
*  minister and wield certain presidential powers by majority vote.
*  Members of the council include a former employee of the World Bank.
*  Its mandate expires February 2026.
*  The Biden administration's reimposed oil sanctions on Venezuela, saying President Nicolas
*  Maduro has not enforced promised reforms ahead of July elections.
*  Some U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry were lifted last year.
*  Under the condition, Maduro allowed opposition candidates to participate in the elections
*  with several have been banned from running.
*  The U.S. Senate advanced the passage of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
*  Act, or FISA, Thursday, despite objections from civil liberties advocates and some Democrats.
*  The controversial provision has been used by federal agencies to conduct warrantless
*  surveillance on U.S. citizens.
*  One of the measures critics in Congress, Senator Ron Wyden, said, quote, this issue demands
*  a debate about meaningful reforms, not a rushed vote to rubber-stamp more warrantless
*  government surveillance powers, he said.
*  And 12 jurors, seven men and five women, have been selected for Donald Trump's criminal
*  hush money trial.
*  The six alternates will likely be chosen by the end of today, with opening arguments starting
*  as early as Monday.
*  Trump's charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide $130,000,
*  paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016.
*  Prosecutors said Thursday Trump has repeatedly violated his gag order and asked Judge Juan
*  Marchand to hold Trump in contempt.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
