*  Israel continues to bombard Lebanon, killing at least 25 people so far today, including
*  a family of nine in the border town of Sheba.
*  Israel has killed over 700 people in Lebanon since Monday.
*  In an apparent flip-flop, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday evening he
*  does support a U.S.-led temporary ceasefire effort, though he's done nothing to slow
*  down Israel's assault, and Israeli officials have threatened to launch a ground invasion.
*  Lebanon's Foreign Minister Abdullah Abu Habib addressed the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday.
*  Lebanon is living through a crisis that threatens its very existence.
*  The future of our people and our prosperity are in peril, and this is a situation that
*  requires international intervention on an urgent basis, before the situation spirals
*  out of control with a domino effect, making the crisis impossible to contain.
*  The U.N. says some 30,000 people have fled Lebanon for Syria in recent days.
*  Meanwhile, Syrian media says an Israeli airstrike from the occupied Golan Heights earlier today
*  killed five Syrian soldiers on its border with Lebanon.
*  Israel's assault on Gaza continues with another airstrike on a school sheltering displaced
*  families in Jabalia, which killed at least 14 people Thursday.
*  Where are these people supposed to go?
*  They're not here for leisure or fun.
*  These are people whose homes were destroyed in the north, in Beit Lahiya, Jabalia base,
*  Beit Hanun.
*  This is a question for the international community, which has double standards.
*  We demand the international organizations, the international community, the United Nations
*  to provide us with safe places.
*  Israel's Defense Ministry said Thursday it secured another $8.7 billion in funding from
*  the United States.
*  Israel's killed over 41,500 Palestinians in Gaza since October 7th and wounded 96,000
*  people, according to official numbers.
*  More than 100 U.S. lawmakers have signed on to a letter by Washington Congressmember
*  Adam Smith demanding an independent investigation into Israel's killing of the Turkish-American
*  activist Aishiner Ezgi Aigyi earlier this month in the occupied West Bank.
*  Her family has also demanded the U.S. investigate after the Biden administration said it would
*  instead rely on Israel's internal probe.
*  She just graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle.
*  A Cornell University student is facing deportation to the United Kingdom after administrators
*  suspended him for taking part in a campus protest calling on Cornell to divest from
*  companies that support Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  Mamadou Tal, a Ph.D. student in Africana Studies, says he would advise to leave the U.S. promptly
*  after his academic suspension led Cornell's immigration office to cancel his F-1 student
*  visa this week.
*  Democracy Now! spoke with Mamadou Tal on Thursday.
*  Yes, it's about freedom of speech, but that cannot be divorced from Palestine.
*  The issue why we're facing such repression and such repressive tactics is because it's
*  about Palestine.
*  It's because you're speaking anti-Israel, anti-Israel's genocide in Gaza.
*  If these issues are not separate.
*  So absolutely, I think I'm a visible person.
*  I'm quite outspoken on this issue, and I think this is the reason why I'm being targeted.
*  In related news, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jumpa Lahiri has declined the prestigious
*  Noguchi Museum Award after the museum recently fired three workers for wearing a kaffir.
*  Lahiri, who teaches at Barnard, was one of many academics who signed on to a letter in
*  May expressing support for Gaza solidarity protests on campus.
*  Protests targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took place across New
*  York City Thursday as he arrived in town ahead of his address before the U.N. General Assembly
*  today.
*  Yesterday morning, activists blocked traffic near the U.N. headquarters, unfurling a banner
*  that read, No war, criminals and NYC, stop the genocide, before police began arresting
*  people.
*  More protests and arrests took place throughout the day and into the night.
*  This is Jody Evans, co-founder of Code Pink.
*  He's executing state-sponsored terrorism.
*  The fact that he was allowed to land in this city and he is staying in a hotel and he is
*  not arrested is a shame on everyone in power in the United States and in this city.
*  At the U.N. General Assembly, leaders of low-lying Pacific nations urged the global community
*  decisive action ahead of a major declaration scheduled for 2026 on how the world will tackle
*  sea level rise, an existential threat for many island nations.
*  This is Felity Teo, Prime Minister of Tuvalu.
*  We expect the declaration to include the following.
*  Firstly, to ascertain the principle of statehood continuity as a tenet of international law
*  and international cooperation, and to affirm that statehood cannot be challenged under
*  any circumstances of sea level rise.
*  Our membership in the United Nations and its specialized agency is permanent, notwithstanding
*  the impact of climate change.
*  Hurricane Helene crashed into Florida's Big Bend region overnight as a Category 4 hurricane,
*  bringing 140-mile-an-hour winds and record storm surge to the Gulf Coast.
*  The storm rapidly moved inland and across Georgia, triggering flood and landslide warnings
*  across the southern Appalachians.
*  Up to five related deaths have been reported so far, and some 1.2 million people are without
*  power.
*  Sunrise Movement has welcomed the economic and climate proposal released by Kamala Harris
*  this week as a, quote, significant step forward.
*  The influential climate group said Harris' plan would help, quote, lower prices, expand
*  green energy production and create green union jobs, unquote, but called for even bolder
*  steps to tackle the unfolding climate disaster.
*  New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Thursday he's no intention of stepping down after
*  federal prosecutors indicted him on corruption charges.
*  This is Damien Williams, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.
*  Mayor Adams engaged in a long-running conspiracy in which he solicited and knowingly accepted
*  illegal campaign contributions from foreign donors and corporations.
*  As we allege, Mayor Adams took these contributions even though he knew they were illegal and
*  even though he knew these contributions were attempts by a Turkish government official
*  and Turkish businessman to buy influence with him.
*  We also allege that the mayor sought and accepted well over $100,000 in luxury travel
*  benefits from some of the same foreign actors who arranged many of the illegal campaign
*  contributions.
*  In exchange, prosecutors allege Mayor Adams helped Turkey's government open a new 36-story
*  consular building near the United Nations without a fire inspection.
*  We'll have much more on Mayor Adams' indictment, the first indictment of a mayor in New York
*  City in modern history.
*  Special Counsel Jack Smith on Thursday filed a 180-page brief detailing Trump's efforts
*  to subvert the 2020 election, arguing his case in light of the Supreme Court decision
*  this summer that granted Trump broad immunity against criminal charges.
*  Federal Judge Tanya Chetkin will decide whether the contents of the dossier will be made available
*  to the public before the November election.
*  Democratic Senator Ron Wyden has unveiled a Supreme Court reform bill that includes
*  expanding the court by six justices, mandating audits for justices, automatically scheduling
*  Supreme Court nominees for a Senate vote and requiring supermajorities to overturn laws
*  passed by Congress.
*  Senator Wyden said, quote, The Supreme Court is in crisis.
*  More transparency, more accountability and more checks on a power-hungry Supreme Court
*  are just what the American people are asking for, unquote.
*  President Biden signed a three-month spending bill Thursday, keeping the government funded
*  through December 20th after Congress passed the bill on Wednesday.
*  House Democrats backed the bill after Republican Speaker Mike Johnson withdrew a GOP and Trump
*  Act measure that would require proof of citizenship when registering to vote.
*  President Biden signed an executive order targeting guns.
*  Biden's order creates a task force to investigate new technologies, including 3D printed guns
*  and machine gun conversions.
*  It also orders the drafting of federal guidelines to limit the psychological harm to students
*  of active shooter drills in high schools.
*  President Biden said Thursday the U.S. will surge nearly $8 billion in new military aid
*  to Ukraine, including long-range missiles.
*  Biden made the announcement ahead of a meeting at the White House with Ukrainian President
*  Volodymyr Zelensky.
*  Biden reportedly did not grant Ukraine permission to fire U.S.-made weapons deep into Russian
*  territory.
*  Zelensky also met separately Thursday with Vice President Kamala Harris, who pledged
*  unwavering support to Ukraine after the talks.
*  HISTORY HAS SHOWN US.
*  If we allow aggressors like Putin to take land with impunity, they keep going.
*  And Putin could set his sights on Poland, the Baltic states and other NATO allies.
*  Putin started this war and he could end it tomorrow if he simply withdrew his troops
*  from Ukraine's sovereign territory.
*  On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to use nuclear weapons to respond
*  to Ukraine's attacks on Russian territory if they're supported by a nuclear-armed
*  nation.
*  A Hong Kong court Thursday sentenced two editors of the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper
*  Stand News to jail time after their conviction last month on sedition charges.
*  Chung Pui Kuen will serve 21 months.
*  Patrick Lam received an 11-month sentence, but will avoid jail on medical grounds.
*  It's the first time journalists have been convicted of sedition since Hong Kong was
*  handed over from Britain to China in 1997 and comes as part of Beijing's crackdown
*  on Hong Kong's autonomy.
*  In Haiti, the U.N. says over 3,600 people have been killed in gang violence in the first
*  half of the year.
*  Earlier this week, Haiti's interim prime minister, Gary Kunil, said his country is
*  quote nowhere near winning this, as he addressed Haiti's spiraling security and humanitarian
*  situation on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.
*  Despite the dire situation, the group Haitian Bridge Alliance said the Biden administration
*  chartered yet another deportation flight with Haitian asylum seekers on Thursday.
*  And new data from Argentina's Statistics Agency shows the country's poverty rate
*  has skyrocketed to 53 percent after six months of the far-right libertarian president Javier
*  Millet's austerity policies.
*  That's up 11 percent since last year, as the number of people living in extreme poverty
*  grew by 3 million during the first half of this year.
*  This is Irma Casal of Buenos Aires, one of the many people who say they've suffered
*  under the new government's economic shock therapy.
*  Since Millet's government took office, our work has dropped.
*  We work twice as much for less, and we have to continue.
*  At my age, I'm not getting hired anywhere else except maybe dragging a cart and nothing
*  more, so I keep pushing forward.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, War, Peace and the Presidency.
