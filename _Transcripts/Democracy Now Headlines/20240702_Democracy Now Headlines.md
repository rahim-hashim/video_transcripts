# Top U.S. & World Headlines — July 2, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [July 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epqQRk9tis4)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The United States Supreme Court ruled Monday Donald Trump has immunity from prosecution
*  for official actions taken as president.
*  The 6-3 ruling by the court's right-wing majority, including all three justices appointed
*  by Trump, was issued on the final day of the Supreme Court's term and just four months
*  ahead of the November presidential election.
*  It will further delay Trump's criminal trial for leading the January 6 insurrection.
*  The ruling upends more than two centuries of legal precedent, for the first time shielding
*  U.S. presidents from criminal accountability.
*  In a scathing dissent signed by justices Elena Kagan, Katanji Brown Jackson, Justice Sonia
*  Sotomayor wrote, quote,
*  "...never in the history of our republic as a president had reason to believe that he
*  would be immune from criminal prosecution if he used the trappings of his office to
*  violate the criminal law.
*  Moving forward, however, all former presidents will be cloaked in such immunity," she wrote.
*  Donald Trump celebrated the ruling on social media, writing,
*  "...big win for our constitution and democracy, proud to be an American," unquote.
*  President Biden denounced the ruling in a five-minute speech from the White House.
*  This nation was founded on the principle that there are no kings in America.
*  Each, each of us is equal before the law.
*  No one, no one is above the law, not even the president of the United States.
*  But today's Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity, that fundamentally changed.
*  Monday's landmark ruling follows a series of high-profile corruption scandals at the
*  Supreme Court and after Justices Samuel Leto and Clarence Thomas refused to recuse themselves
*  from the case over conflicts of interest.
*  That sparked some Democrats to call for their impeachment.
*  On Monday, New York Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote, quote,
*  "...the Supreme Court has become consumed by a corruption crisis beyond its control.
*  Today's ruling represents an assault on American democracy.
*  It's up to Congress to defend our nation from this authoritarian capture.
*  I intend on filing articles of impeachment upon our return," she said.
*  We'll have more on Monday's momentous Supreme Court ruling after headlines.
*  Israel's armies ordered a mass expulsion of Palestinians from parts of Qanyunas,
*  Gaza's second-largest city, as it prepares for another ground invasion.
*  Qanyunas was already destroyed in a previous Israeli assault.
*  The order set off a panicked evacuation of patients from the Gaza European Hospital,
*  one of the last functioning medical centers in Gaza.
*  This comes as the Palestinian Red Crescent Society reports at least eight people were
*  killed and over 30 others wounded in renewed strikes on southern Gaza.
*  On Monday, Israel freed the director of Gaza's largest medical center after detaining him
*  without charge for seven months.
*  Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmaa of Al-Shifa Hospital said after his release that his Israeli captors
*  broke his fingers and repeatedly struck him in the head as part of daily torture he and
*  other Palestinians endured.
*  The prisoners are undergoing extremely harsh conditions from scarcity of food and drink
*  as well as physical torture.
*  The prisoners are all facing brutal conditions right now.
*  Hundreds of medical staff, including doctors, nurses, radiation specialists and others,
*  were targeted and are stuck in occupation army prisons being tortured.
*  Dr. Abu Salmaa said prisoners lost an average of 25 kilos, or 55 pounds, of body weight
*  after they were denied adequate food and water.
*  Meanwhile, human rights groups are condemning Israel's army for using Palestinians in
*  Gaza and the West Bank as human shields during combat.
*  Video published by Al Jazeera shows Israeli soldiers attaching body cameras to handcuffed
*  Palestinian civilians and forcing them into dangerous combat zones.
*  More video shows soldiers tying a wounded and bleeding Palestinian man onto the hood
*  of a military vehicle during a raid on the city of Jenin.
*  The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor wrote, quote,
*  Each of the aforementioned acts of criminal brutal and inhumane behavior constitutes
*  a grave violation of the rules of international humanitarian law and is a full-fledged war
*  crime."
*  Unquote.
*  Hurricane Barrel has strengthened into an extremely dangerous Category 5 hurricane.
*  After devastating the Windward Islands and the Caribbean, Granada's prime minister
*  said the small island of Karayaku had been flattened by the immense storm.
*  A quarter of Barbados residents were left without power.
*  Meanwhile, at least two people were killed in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where
*  Prime Minister Ralph Goncalves said 90 percent of the houses on Union Island were severely
*  damaged or destroyed.
*  Forecasters warn Barrel is likely to remain an extremely dangerous major hurricane as
*  it threatens Jamaica and the Cayman Islands ahead of a possible landfall in Mexico's
*  Yucatan Peninsula.
*  It is by far the earliest Category 5 storm ever observed in the Atlantic and comes as
*  climate scientists predict an extremely active 2024 hurricane season.
*  Pakistan has begun the second phase of a contested campaign to expel undocumented Afghan refugees.
*  Some 800,000 Afghans are expected to be forcibly returned.
*  Another half million Afghans were expelled from Pakistan last November after authorities
*  raided their homes and makeshift shelters.
*  Many fear having to live under Taliban rule and say they have nothing to go back to in
*  Afghanistan.
*  Meanwhile, Taliban representatives have arrived in Qatar to participate in UN-led talks alongside
*  delegations from over two dozen countries aimed at reintegrating Afghanistan into the
*  international community.
*  It's the first time the Taliban will be present at such meetings.
*  No country has officially recognized Taliban rule, and the UN has said it won't do so
*  until Afghanistan lifts bans on female education and employment.
*  In Panama, President José Raúl Molino was sworn in Monday, vowing to block asylum seekers
*  from crossing through the treacherous Darien jungle as they head north to the United States.
*  U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was among those who attended the
*  inauguration.
*  Molino announced an agreement with the Biden administration to deport migrants who are
*  apprehended in the Darien Gap while the U.S. helps cover the cost of deportation flights.
*  Today, the number of migrants passing through the Darien Gap is staggering.
*  Plus, international criminals use this region as their operations base.
*  I will appeal to international solidarity in regards of the cause of the problem, and
*  I will seek solutions with the involved countries, especially the United States, as it's the
*  final destination of migrants.
*  Molino is Panama's former public security minister.
*  Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has agreed to resume direct negotiations with
*  the United States as part of ongoing talks to ease U.S. sanctions, which have devastated
*  Venezuela's economy and driven millions of people to leave Venezuela.
*  Maduro spoke from Caracas Monday.
*  For two months, I've received a proposal from the government of the United States to
*  restore conversations and direct dialogue.
*  After mulling it over for two months, I have accepted.
*  Next Wednesday, conversations with the government of the United States will restart.
*  This comes less than a month before Venezuela's presidential election, scheduled for the end
*  of July, in which Maduro seeks a third term in office.
*  And here in the United States, most of the deaths that have occurred in the custody of
*  Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, in recent years could have been prevented
*  if detained migrants and asylum seekers were given adequate medical care.
*  That's according to a new report by the ACLU and other rights groups, which looked
*  at 52 deaths of immigrants held in ICE detention centers between 2017 and 2021 and pointed
*  to gross medical and mental health care neglect by ICE as causing preventable deaths, including
*  suicides.
*  The report said, quote, ICE's current oversight and accountability mechanisms regarding death
*  and detention are critically flawed and do little to prevent future deaths.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
