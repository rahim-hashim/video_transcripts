*  And then, historic move.
*  Ireland, Norway and Spain have announced they'll recognize Palestine as an independent state,
*  becoming the first European nations to do so.
*  Norway's prime minister, Juna Skarture, spoke in Oslo.
*  There can be no peace in the Middle East without Palestinians and Israelis having their own
*  states in that there is a two-state solution.
*  There cannot be a two-state solution without a Palestinian state.
*  And in other words, peace in the Middle East requires a Palestinian state.
*  Ireland's new prime minister, Simon Harris, referenced Ireland's own history of emerging
*  from colonial rule as he announced recognition of a Palestinian state.
*  This is an historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine.
*  Taking our place on the world stage and being recognized by others as having the right to
*  be there was a matter of the highest importance for the founders of our state.

*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken has told senators that the Biden administration is
*  ready to work on efforts to potentially sanction officials at the International Criminal Court
*  after the court's chief prosecutor requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister
*  Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Galant.
*  Blinken called the ICC decision, quote, profoundly wrongheaded.
*  Meanwhile, pro-Palestinian protesters repeatedly disrupted Blinken Tuesday as he testified

*  live video.
*  Closing arguments will begin next Tuesday in Donald Trump's criminal hush money and
*  2016 election interference trial.
*  The defense rested their case Tuesday after Trump declined to take the stand, even though
*  he repeatedly said he would.
*  Donald Trump's campaign has removed a social media video that included a reference to,
*  quote, the creation of a unified Reich.
*  The campaign's decision came after the former president was widely denounced for adopting
*  a term often associated with the Nazis.
*  President Biden accused Trump of using, quote, Hitler's language.
*  Meanwhile, Trump suggested in an interview on Tuesday that he supports restrictions on
*  birth control.
*  He was questioned by a journalist at KDKA in Pittsburgh.
*  Do you support any restrictions on a person's right to contraception?
*  Well, we're looking at that, and I'm going to have a policy on that very shortly, and
*  I think it's something that you'll find interesting.
*  Trump went on to say, quote, some states are going to have different policy than others,
*  unquote.
*  After facing backlash, Trump wrote on social media that he would, quote, never advocate
*  imposing restrictions on birth control.

*  Raisi will be buried Thursday in his hometown of Rashad.
*  In news from Sudan, Doctors Without Borders reports at least 85 people have died in recent
*  fighting in the Darfur city of al-Fasher.
*  This comes as the United Nations is warning a genocide may already be occurring in Sudan.
*  Alice Wairimu-Nediritu, the U.N. special advisor on the prevention of genocide, addressed the
*  U.N. Security Council.
*  I would like today to raise my alarm in a clear and unequivocal way about the ongoing
*  situation in Sudan.
*  This situation today bears all the marks of risk of genocide, with strong allegations
*  that this crime has already been committed.
*  A Greek judge has dismissed a case against nine Egyptian men accused of smuggling migrants
*  in the Pylos shipwreck that killed some 600 people last June.
*  The decision came just after the men's trial began.
*  The accused men had said they were being scapegoated and are themselves victims.
*  In the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, 14 people have been killed in attacks targeting
*  local candidates ahead of the June 2nd election.
*  According to one tally, at least 134 people have been killed in politically motivated
*  attacks in Mexico this year, including 24 political candidates.
*  During a debate on Sunday, presidential frontrunner Claudia Scheinbaum of the Morena Party vowed
*  to continue the policies of Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
*  We are going to build a future of peace and prosperity.
*  Our country's transformation has already begun, and we will continue it.
*  We have results, and we are going to take them to the whole country.
*  Scheinbaum's top challenger, Xochitl Gávez, accused the current government of failing
*  to fight organized crime.
*  Security has been a failure in the six-year term.
*  186,000 people have been murdered and 50,000 people have disappeared.
*  What has been the strategy of this government?
*  To hand the country over to organized crime?
*  I propose a new security strategy.
*  No more hugs for the criminals.
*  If either of the two frontrunners win, they will become the first female president in
*  Mexico's history.
*  And the cultural historian and author H. Bush Franklin has died at the age of 90.
*  He was a former Air Force navigator and intelligence officer who became radicalized by the U.S.
*  War in Vietnam.
*  In 1972, Franklin became the first tenured professor to be fired by Stanford University,
*  after the school accused him of inciting students to take over a campus computer center which
*  had ties to the U.S. military.
*  He later taught at Rutgers University in Newark.
*  He was the author of 20 books on topics ranging from the Vietnam War to Herman Melville.
*  He appeared on Democracy Now! in 2000, where he spoke about Vietnam.
*  made it possible for us to participate in that war, to carry out the most systematic
*  destruction of a nation that any nation has ever done in history, and part of the time
*  thinking that we were there for good reasons to defend peace and democracy and so on.
*  That was all based on fantasies.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
