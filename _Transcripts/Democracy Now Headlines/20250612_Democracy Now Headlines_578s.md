We go to Los Angeles, where immigrant workers and families are feeling the impact of ICE raids on worksites like Home Depot. While hundreds have been detained, countless others are left to wonder whether they can safely go to work or school, fearing for their families. "The life of an immigrant in Los Angeles and across this country … is full of uncertainties," says Pablo Alvarado, co-executive director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. "Families don't know whether they're going to see their parents when they leave in the morning to go to work."

# U.S. Accepts "Fruits of Migrant Labor" But Not Immigrants' Humanity: L.A. Day Laborer Organizer
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=3.16s)]
*  We turn now to Los Angeles, where community-led protests have been ongoing for six days in [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=4.24s)]
*  response to President Trump's immigration crackdown. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=8.44s)]
*  Protests began after ICE carried out a series of operations across Southern California last [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  week. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=17.6s)]
*  A curfew downtown L.A. remains in effect. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=18.6s)]
*  Nearly 400 people have been arrested since protests began Friday. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  President Trump's taken the extraordinary step of federalizing the National Guard to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=25.8s)]
*  deploy to L.A. and activating some 700 Marines over the objections of California Governor [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=32.08s)]
*  Newsom, who's now suing the administration. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=38.4s)]
*  But at the center of this crisis are the immigrant workers, families, communities who've been [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=41.04s)]
*  directly impacted by the ICE crackdown. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=45.0s)]
*  Hundreds have been arrested in L.A. over the last week alone. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=48.0s)]
*  This is Kimberly Hernandez, whose father is now missing after a raid on a car wash [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=51.76s)]
*  where he worked. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=56.28s)]
*  We are extremely sad to not know where he is. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=57.28s)]
*  We have not been able to find him, and this is unfair. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=61.32s)]
*  We would like justice for him. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=64.2s)]
*  And we would stop. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=70.16s)]
*  We would like to live without the fear of being detained at all times. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=71.16s)]
*  As immigrant families are navigating this uncertainty, deciding whether or not to go [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=78.2s)]
*  to work, to go to school, to go to a health clinic, fearing for themselves and their families, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  we're joined in Pasadena, California, by Pablo Alvarado, co-executive director of Endelon, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=87.72s)]
*  the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  Pablo, let's get right down to what is so personal for so many right now in the greater [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=96.44s)]
*  Los Angeles area. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=103.4s)]
*  Give the day and the life of an immigrant worker. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=106.16s)]
*  Good morning, Amy, and thank you for having me in your show. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  The life of an immigrant in Los Angeles and across this country, but particularly now [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=117.72s)]
*  in our city, is full of uncertainties. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=124.8s)]
*  For a day laborer going to a home depot to seek work, to feed their families, it's full [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=128.68s)]
*  with a notion of uncertainties. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=138.08s)]
*  It's not that just that you don't know whether you're going to find a job or not, whether [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=141.0s)]
*  you're going to get paid or not, whether you're going to have an accident at the workplace [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=147.4s)]
*  receive proper medical care or not, is now whether you're going to be essentially arrested, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=152.16s)]
*  detained, disappeared into this system of immigration that we have in this country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=159.12s)]
*  Families don't know whether they're going to see their parents when they leave in the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=168.84s)]
*  morning to go to work. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=172.52s)]
*  And people don't have any other choice because you have to provide for your family. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=174.88s)]
*  So it's a lot of anguish. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=180.34s)]
*  There's a lot of frustration. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=183.06s)]
*  There's anger. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=185.26s)]
*  There's fear. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=186.82s)]
*  And all of these sentiments together have sparked protests all over Los Angeles, all [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=189.02s)]
*  over Southern California, not just in downtown Los Angeles. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=194.9s)]
*  I know that people are focusing on downtown L.A. because that's where the violence oftentimes [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=199.5s)]
*  is taking place. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=206.2s)]
*  But there have been protests in Downey, in Pasadena, in Santa Ana, in Monrovia, in Whittier, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=207.34s)]
*  in many places, even in front of the hotels where the ICE agents are staying. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=213.98s)]
*  So yes, there's fear. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=217.85999999999999s)]
*  There is that—all of those sentiments in our hearts, because the people that they are [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=219.54s)]
*  taking are members of our community. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=224.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to read that because they have names. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=229.01999999999998s)]
*  And their parents, their fathers, in the case that they live with their fathers, their grandfathers, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=231.85999999999999s)]
*  their sons. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=237.22s)]
*  And you see—I remember Sergio Lopez, Ramiro Arche, Ramiro Tocque, Daniel Lopez-Pop. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=238.22s)]
*  They have names. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=245.17999999999998s)]
*  Pablo, you've been organizing day laborers for over 20 years. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=246.17999999999998s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal, as a report last month, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=251.82s)]
*  Miller said during a meeting at the headquarters of ICE that officials should target Home Depots [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=256.14s)]
*  and 7-Eleven stores so they can detain and deport day laborers. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=262.2s)]
*  You are part of—or rather, if you can talk about the Pasadena Job Center, which helps [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=268.0s)]
*  connect employers with workers, and the increased significance of this focus not on murderers [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=273.88s)]
*  and rapists, but on job centers. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=281.2s)]
*  Well, it appears that, yes, ICE and all of the federal agencies that are collaborating [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=286.2s)]
*  together are indeed executing the orders that Stephen Miller gave, and they are systematically [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  going to Home Depots. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=302.44s)]
*  And yes, day laborers and worker centers have become part of the landscape on not just Los [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  Angeles, but all of—in major cities across the country. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=311.34s)]
*  Immigrant families, day laborer families, are part of the socioeconomic fabric of every [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=314.92s)]
*  single community all over Los Angeles. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=320.6s)]
*  I happen to live in Pasadena, where the fires took place, a mile and a half away from Altadena. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  We were impacted. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=333.74s)]
*  There's a worker center here. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=334.74s)]
*  And let me tell you what happened right after the fire. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=336.68s)]
*  It was immigrant workers that came to our place telling us, what I possess in this life [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=339.64s)]
*  is in my body right now, but no longer—not only I don't have a job anymore, a house [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=345.0s)]
*  anymore, but I don't have a job anymore because the house of my employer burned down. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=352.08s)]
*  And yet these are the very same people that are removing the debris. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=357.79999999999995s)]
*  These are the same people that are remediating the homes of people adjacent to the fires. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=362.64s)]
*  And yes, these are the people that are going to rebuild Los Angeles. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=369.4s)]
*  In fact, it's impossible to rebuild Los Angeles without migrant labor. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  Forty percent of the workforce in the construction industry is migrant labor, documented and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=378.4s)]
*  undocumented. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=384.4s)]
*  And this is the hypocrisy of what—the hypocrisy we're fighting against all over this country. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=385.56s)]
*  Our country is willing to accept the fruits of migrant labor, but it's not willing to [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=391.12s)]
*  accept the humanity of people. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=395.76s)]
*  First fire and then ice. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=398.24s)]
*  That's what the people of Altadena and Pasadena have been exposed to. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=400.4s)]
*  And as you were describing, Pablo, these workers are now exposed, I mean, to the toxic cleanups. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=404.76s)]
*  They're the ones doing this cleanup. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=411.08s)]
*  saying, we've got to expand these arrests to 3,000 a day, which—how can they do that, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=414.76s)]
*  but go to work sites and find active workers? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=422.4s)]
*  Well, they are saying that they are not going to go to the places that have been impacted [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=426.88s)]
*  by the fires. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=434.56s)]
*  But they were here staying at the hotel in Pasadena. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  Unfortunately, that community, people from all walks of life—by the way, it's not [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  just migrant families that are coming out to protest the presence of ice in our communities. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=442.64000000000004s)]
*  It's people from all walks of life that are coming. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=448.64000000000004s)]
*  You know, soccer moms, I've never seen that protesting to protect immigrant workers. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=453.16s)]
*  We have the council members coming out, the political class, everybody coming out. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=462.52000000000004s)]
*  Before we end, you're from El Salvador. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=468.04s)]
*  You fled El Salvador. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=470.32000000000005s)]
*  Now President Trump is sending people back to El Salvador, where the president of El [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=472.20000000000005s)]
*  Salvador himself calls himself a dictator. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=477.16s)]
*  If you can respond to this possibility and what people are facing when they're deported [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=481.44s)]
*  to the places where their very lives were threatened. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=488.32000000000005s)]
*  You know, your question reminds me about all of this narrative about gangs. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=492.56s)]
*  I just want to remind Americans that gangs are a creation of this country. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=501.44s)]
*  And when people, when gang members were deported to El Salvador, the gang problem was exported [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=508.28s)]
*  from the U.S. to El Salvador. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=513.88s)]
*  And what the— [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=518.52s)]
*  Pabla, we have 15 seconds. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=519.52s)]
*  Well, Bukele has established a state of exception in El Salvador. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=522.52s)]
*  And it appears that now Mr. Trump wants to import that state of exception to the United [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=527.16s)]
*  States. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=533.52s)]
*  And it's unacceptable. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=534.52s)]
*  And it's un-American. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=535.52s)]
*  And we are going to fight it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=536.52s)]
*  We're going to continue this conversation in Spanish and post it on our Spanish website, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=537.52s)]
*  democracynow.org. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=542.04s)]

*  States have been deported to CICOT, the maximum security prison in El Salvador. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOB6lCUGos&t=549.64s)]
