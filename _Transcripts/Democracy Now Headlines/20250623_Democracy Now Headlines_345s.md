After President Trump’s attack on Iran over the weekend, civil society leaders are organizing to demand an end to the violence. We speak with Iranian American scholar Kaveh Ehsani, associate professor of international studies at DePaul University in Chicago, who helped organize a petition against the war signed by more than 1,000 academics in the United States, Europe and Iran. “What this is doing is immiserating further the lives of ordinary people,” says Ehsani.

# Does War on Iran Deflect Attention from Genocide in Gaza?
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8)
*  I want to bring in a third Iranian, an Iranian-American, a voice from civil society here in the U.S., [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=0.0s)]
*  and the call to stop the war on Iran. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=7.28s)]
*  That's the name of a petition that's gathered more than a thousand signatures by academics [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=10.36s)]
*  based in the U.S., Europe and Iran. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=14.8s)]
*  It reads in part, quote, Netanyahu and Trump are dragging the U.S. into Israel's illegal [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=17.48s)]
*  war on Iran, which will cause more destruction and further destabilize the Middle East for [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=22.8s)]
*  the foreseeable future, unquote. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=27.84s)]
*  The petition also notes, quote, this aggression is also a calculated attempt to deflect attention [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=30.16s)]
*  from the ongoing genocide it's committing in Gaza and to unleash a cascade of catastrophes [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=36.24s)]
*  that aim to turn Iran into a failed state, unquote. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=42.12s)]
*  The petition continuing, the Middle East is replete with tragic cases of societies descending [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=45.58s)]
*  into chaos following foreign interventions, Libya, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=51.96s)]
*  For more, we're joined by one of the petition's organizers, the Iranian-American Professor [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=58.56s)]
*  Kaveh Asani, Associate Professor of International Studies at DePaul University in Chicago, also [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=64.0s)]
*  contributing editor at Merup and on the board of its directors in regular communication [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=70.84s)]
*  with activists, journalists and scholars in Iran. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=76.12s)]
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, Professor Asani. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=79.16s)]
*  Explain this thousand-person signed petition and why you're acting now. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  Glad to be here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=89.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=93.12s)]
*  The point is that I agree with most of what was said in terms of, you know, the international [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  situation. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  The key point is that there is a tendency to speak in the name of Iranians in general, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=105.16s)]
*  you know, represent them as if though they want this regime, they don't want the regime, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  they want forceful external military intervention to replace the regime or not. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=115.08s)]
*  Our point was, as scholars of Iran, as people who have been studying it, who have worked [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=121.9s)]
*  there, who have done field work, who have lived and worked in Iran, is that nobody can [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  at this point speak for Iranians as a whole. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=131.72s)]
*  Your first speaker, Mr. Marandi, pointed out that there's a universal consensus among [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=134.84s)]
*  Iranians to support the establishment, the Islamic Republic, that Evin Prison is, you [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=139.32s)]
*  know, in fact full of petty criminals. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  Nothing is further from the truth, and this is, you know, laughable as a claim. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=149.52s)]
*  It is full of political prisoners, many of them waiting execution for protesting the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=154.28s)]
*  regime. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=159.12s)]
*  The point is that Iranians can speak, and as a diverse society of 90 million, they have [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=160.12s)]
*  multiple views. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=165.68s)]
*  Some indeed support the current establishment, many do not. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=167.04s)]
*  But the point is that there is a consensus against this war of aggression from outside, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  because it's affecting everyone. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=175.72s)]
*  And Iran is a society that has lived already through one devastating war, the Iran-Iraq [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=177.22s)]
*  war of the 1980s. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=181.88s)]
*  There is solidarity, there is horizontal mutual help, but the fact is that sanctions and war [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=184.72s)]
*  only immisery people, only destroy civil society and existing organizations that people have [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=191.24s)]
*  built as ways of pushing back against repressions, against authoritarianism. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=197.48s)]
*  So what we see, what we support effectively here in our statement is that we should really [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=203.92s)]
*  put our belief and support behind civil society organizations in Iran, trade unions, nurses, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=209.6s)]
*  pensioners, feminists working in Baluchistan, and other active civil society organizations [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=216.6s)]
*  that are first opposing the war as fully realizing that what this is doing is immiserating further [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  the lives of ordinary people, people making it harder to actually organize, to actually [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=235.4s)]
*  voice their opinions, to voice their positions. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=241.32000000000002s)]
*  And secondly, it will only open the hands of the regime to accuse anybody who is objecting [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=245.16s)]
*  to the current situation as a fifth columnist, as they are doing. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=252.28s)]
*  For example, the current Iranian regime has targeted Afghan refugees, the most vulnerable [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=256.92s)]
*  strata of Iranian society, as a potential fifth column, and they're expelling them [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=262.0s)]
*  even more forcefully than they were before. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=267.72s)]
*  If you think ICE is doing worse, awful things in the United States, the Iranian regime is [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  doing the same thing with Afghan refugees at this point. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  So the only chance that we have of actually establishing a democratic polity in Iran, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  whether this leads to the regime change, whether it leads to its transformation from within, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  through reform, through negotiation, or through more radical means, that's up to Iranian [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=290.72s)]
*  people inside. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=297.0s)]
*  External military interventions will only destroy the possibility of democracy. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=298.76s)]
*  And I think— [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=303.48s)]
*  We have 20 seconds. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=304.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=307.48s)]
*  But this was the gist of our statement, and we really stand with civil society organizations [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=308.64s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=317.08s)]
*  And I think we should condemn this war no matter what, but this is not in support of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=318.08s)]
*  the existing Islamic Republic. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAifaNxYk8&t=322.52s)]
