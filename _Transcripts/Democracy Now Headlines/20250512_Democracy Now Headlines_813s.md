We speak with Congressmember Bonnie Watson Coleman, one of three Democratic lawmakers the Department of Homeland Security has threatened to arrest after they went Friday to inspect a newly reopened private ICE jail. They are accused of assaulting ICE officers. This comes after federal agents arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka on trespassing charges after he joined their congressional delegation. The response of Trump officials has been to “lie and to deflect and to try to create legitimacy for illegitimate things that they are doing,” says Watson Coleman.

**Democracy Now Headlines:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk)

*  As we've reported, on Friday, these agents arrested the mayor of Newark, Ross Baraka, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=6.38s)]
*  on trespassing charges, after he joined a congressional delegation to inspect a privately [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  run immigration jail in Newark. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=20.26s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security has also threatened to arrest the three Democratic [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=22.66s)]
*  lawmakers who visited the ICE jail, LaMonica McIver, Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=28.54s)]
*  They accused them of assaulting ICE officers. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=36.86s)]
*  This is DHS spokesperson Trisha McLaughlin on CNN Saturday. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=40.620000000000005s)]
*  There will likely be more arrests coming. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=45.3s)]
*  We actually have body camera footage of some of these members of Congress assaulting our [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=48.540000000000006s)]
*  ICE enforcement officers, including body slamming a female ICE officer, so we will be showing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=54.86s)]
*  that to viewers very shortly. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=61.940000000000005s)]
*  You're saying a video of members of Congress body slamming ICE officials? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=63.34s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=68.18s)]
*  That's correct sir, it's disgusting. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=69.9s)]
*  Okay, and so if you have that video, are you suggesting that members of Congress will be [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=71.94s)]
*  arrested who were there yesterday? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  This is an ongoing investigation and that is definitely on the table. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=79.54s)]
*  Those arrests could apparently come at any time. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=84.02s)]
*  Congress member Bonnie Watson Coleman denied McLaughlin's allegations, writing, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=88.5s)]
*  The notion that I or any of my colleagues body slammed armed federal officers is absurd. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=95.3s)]
*  DHS is lying because they know their agents were out of line, she wrote. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, Congress member Rob Menendez issued a statement, quote, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=108.3s)]
*  As members of Congress, we have a legal right to conduct oversight at any DHS facility without [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=112.38s)]
*  prior notice, as we have already done twice this year. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=116.82s)]
*  Throughout every step of this visit, ICE attempted to intimidate everyone involved and impede [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=119.58s)]
*  our ability to conduct oversight. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=123.78s)]
*  This is like nothing I've ever seen before, and I'm shocked and disturbed that something [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=126.02s)]
*  like this happened in our community, Menendez said. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=130.66s)]
*  For more, we are joined by Democratic New Jersey Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=134.62s)]
*  is an 80-year-old cancer survivor. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=140.26000000000002s)]
*  She was out on Friday along with fellow Congress members MacGyver and Menendez. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=143.1s)]
*  And when Mayor Baraka was being arrested, they were trying to shield him. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=148.46s)]
*  New Jersey Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=156.58s)]
*  If you can respond to what the DHS spokesperson said, calling your actions, the actions of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=161.26s)]
*  the delegation, disgusting. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=168.7s)]
*  Thank you very much for having me. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=172.61999999999998s)]
*  We were there for reasons that are permitted under law to conduct this inspection, or oversight [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=174.33999999999997s)]
*  inspection of the facility. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=181.82s)]
*  We were delayed and delayed and delayed, and there was one excuse after another. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=183.94s)]
*  Finally, everyone showed up from the Newark offices of ICE. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=188.89999999999998s)]
*  We thought now we were going to start the tour. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=194.17999999999998s)]
*  That didn't happen. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=197.45999999999998s)]
*  We went outside because we understood the mayor was there, and these ICE officials were [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=198.73999999999998s)]
*  going down to meet him. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=202.78s)]
*  We were there when they asked him to leave. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=205.7s)]
*  He turned around, walked away, walked behind the gates, and went on public property. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=208.26s)]
*  We thought now we were going to proceed to go to our, do our tour. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=214.92s)]
*  We saw ICE members huddling together on the phone, and the next thing we heard was we're [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  going to arrest the mayor. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=225.01999999999998s)]
*  We're going to lock him up. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=227.34s)]
*  And we asked, well, why? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  He's on public property. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  You asked him to leave, he left. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  There was no issue with his leaving. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  And so when they opened the gate, they rushed upon him with several officers, maybe 20 or [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=237.38000000000002s)]
*  so, and LaMonica and Rob and I tried to shield the mayor. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=248.14000000000001s)]
*  We tried to stand between them and the mayor, hoping that this thing would not escalate. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=254.22s)]
*  At the same time, we were saying, why are you doing this? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=261.58s)]
*  Why are you doing this? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=263.5s)]
*  He hasn't done anything. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=265.18s)]
*  And then you saw the chaos after that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=267.18s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=269.74s)]
*  They said, Department of Homeland Security, they're releasing the footage. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=270.74s)]
*  They released it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=273.9s)]
*  They said it would show the body slamming. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=274.9s)]
*  We don't see any such thing in the video they released. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=277.54s)]
*  You're now calling for the full video to be released? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=280.54s)]
*  You're looking for the full video to be released and anyone else that was filming from their [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=284.34000000000003s)]
*  own personal cameras and other cameras while we were there, there was no body slamming. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=289.18s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security, the representatives from the administration are doing what they [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=294.98s)]
*  do consistently, and that is to lie and to deflect and to try to create legitimacy for [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=300.98s)]
*  illegitimate things that they are doing. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=309.66s)]
*  And so, we need people to see this. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=312.44s)]
*  This is a very scary moment in our governance and our towns across the nation. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  And we're very concerned about other folks just trying to go about their lives and being [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=321.67999999999995s)]
*  accosted and being held and being disappearing under this administration. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=326.67999999999995s)]
*  This is very un-American, and this is just very scary. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=331.64s)]
*  Now, Congressmember Bonnie Watson Coleman, you actually got to tour the facility after [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=336.08s)]
*  Baraka was arrested. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=344.84s)]
*  Number one, I was wondering if you saw him in a cell. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=347.08s)]
*  But number two, can you tell us what you and Menendez and McIvor, the three Congressmember—the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=350.8s)]
*  three of you saw inside? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=356.32s)]
*  So, we toured the facilities. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=358.28s)]
*  We toured the area where they were holding people, the area where you would eat, the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  area where you cook, some of the bathroom facilities, the medical area. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=366.92s)]
*  The place is not as clean as it could be, but relatively so. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  They're staffing up now, and they're waiting for ICE to approve the new individuals to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=379.68s)]
*  come in. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=385.68s)]
*  So, there were things like dirt balls on the floor. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=386.68s)]
*  We went into the elevator to go up to the second floor. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  We had a hard time getting on the elevator with the person who's the director of the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=393.68s)]
*  facility. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=399.24s)]
*  When we wanted to leave the second floor, we got onto the elevator, and the elevator [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=400.24s)]
*  wouldn't move. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=404.44s)]
*  So, one of the complaints and concerns, the safety and security of the elevators, and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=405.44s)]
*  that's one of the issues that's been under inspection. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  But we did conduct it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=415.32s)]
*  We talked to several of the women who were there. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  There were five women, I believe, all of whom were confused. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=420.0s)]
*  They hadn't had a chance to talk to their lawyers or their families. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=424.35999999999996s)]
*  They didn't know what was going to happen next. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  They were being fed. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=430.44s)]
*  They were not being treated poorly by the staff, but the staff was minimal in the facility. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=432.03999999999996s)]
*  But clearly, these were women from Honduras, Venezuela, and another place that I can't [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=439.52s)]
*  remember, who were just really concerned about what was going to happen to them next. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=449.28s)]
*  New Jersey Congressmember Bonnie Watson Coleman, you are 80 years old. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=456.59999999999997s)]
*  You're a cancer survivor. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=463.08s)]
*  You publicly talked about what that battle was all about. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=466.55999999999995s)]
*  And the last video that you just put out is about what's happening today in Congress. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  It's about the Republican leadership attempting to cut something like $800 billion from Medicaid. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=476.04s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can comment on what's taking place now in Congress. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=484.16s)]
*  Well, we're going to have a series of hearings this week, actually, on the president's [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=489.12s)]
*  so-called skinny budget. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=495.6s)]
*  There is $880 billion in directions to cut out of energy and commerce. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=497.48s)]
*  And 75 percent of that money goes to Medicaid that goes to the states to take care of people [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=506.88s)]
*  who are in nursing homes, have disabilities, need health care in some form or another, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=513.08s)]
*  and meet certain other socioeconomic eligibility. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=519.68s)]
*  It also covers children, the children's health care program. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=527.08s)]
*  If you're going to cut $880 billion out of a budget, when 75 percent of that budget goes [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=532.4000000000001s)]
*  to that purpose, then you're going to end up cutting life-saving Medicaid help to those [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  who are in nursing homes, to the elderly, to the disabled, et cetera. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=544.84s)]
*  And Republicans keep lying to us about or lying to the country, because they can't lie [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=549.12s)]
*  to us. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=554.12s)]
*  They can't see the facts that they're not going to cut Medicaid. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=555.16s)]
*  But if they find money anywhere, it's going to be as a result of cutting very vulnerable [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwGDYwuIfk&t=562.2s)]
