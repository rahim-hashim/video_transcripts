# Top U.S. & World Headlines — July 8, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [July 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwR0R3UtKAM)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In France, the recently formed leftist coalition, the New Popular Front, pulled off a surprise
*  victory in the second round of parliamentary elections Sunday.
*  The Left-Green Alliance came together in a bid to stave off the far right, after Marine
*  Le Pen's National Rally Party made major advances in the first round and in recent
*  EU elections.
*  But the New Popular Front, which won 182 seats in the National Assembly, still fell short
*  of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority.
*  Sunday's results came as a major blow to not only the far right, which came in third,
*  but to French President Emmanuel Macron, who called the snap election in the hopes French
*  voters would keep his centrist coalition in place.
*  Macron's prime minister, Gabriel Attal, offered his resignation today, but Macron
*  asked him to stay on temporarily.
*  The head of the Progressive France Unbowed Party, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, spoke following
*  his coalition's victory Sunday.
*  The president has the power.
*  The president has the duty to call on the New Popular Front to govern.
*  It is ready.
*  The New Popular Front will respect the mandate, according to the vote cast for its candidates.
*  Our given word will be respected.
*  The New Popular Front will apply its manifesto, all its manifesto and nothing but its manifesto.
*  The New Popular Front has vowed to raise the minimum wage, cap price of essential foods
*  and utilities, and to throw out Macron's hugely unpopular pension reform, which raised
*  the retirement age.
*  The group says it will reimpose taxes on the wealthiest and corporations.
*  The New Popular Front also says it will recognize Palestinian statehood after Macron's government
*  earlier this year refused to do so.
*  We'll have more on the French elections later in the broadcast.
*  Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, Keir Starmer has become Britain's new prime minister
*  after his Labour Party trounced the Conservatives in a general election Thursday.
*  It's the first time Labour has been in power in 14 years, but the election lacked much
*  of the energy and hope for change at Mark France's vote, with the lowest turnout in
*  more than 20 years.
*  Starmer, a centrist politician vowed to lead a government of, quote, stability and moderation.
*  He made his first official address as leader on Friday.
*  For too long now, we've turned a blind eye as millions slid into greater insecurity.
*  Nurses, builders, drivers, carers, people doing the right thing, working harder every
*  day, recognized at moments like this before, yet as soon as the cameras stop rolling, their
*  lives are ignored.
*  I want to say very clearly to those people, not this time.
*  Among the other notable results in the UK election, former Conservative Prime Minister
*  Liz Truss lost her seat in Parliament.
*  Far-right figurehead Nigel Farage, best known for pushing Brexit, won his election in his
*  eighth attempt to gain a seat.
*  Irish nationalist Sinn Fein became Northern Ireland's largest party in the British Parliament
*  for the first time.
*  And the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn easily retained his longtime seat after running
*  as an independent in his London district against Labour.
*  In one of his first moves, Starmor declared the UK Rwanda deportation plan dead and buried.
*  We'll go to the UK for more after headlines and speak with MP Jeremy Corbyn.
*  Voters in Iran have elected Massoud Pesachkian as its new president.
*  The reformist candidate defeated hardliner Saeed Jalili on Saturday.
*  Pesachkian is a heart surgeon who'd served as health minister under reformist President
*  Mohammed Khatami.
*  Pesachkian has criticized Iran's mandatory hijab law for women and has promised to disband
*  Iran's morality police.
*  He's spoken to Iran Saturday.
*  PESACHKIAN, I PROMISE TO DISSPAND IRAN'S MORALITY POLICE
*  … vote as a heavy responsibility on my shoulders, and I pledge to continue to be
*  a listening ear for your words and a voice for the voiceless and the rejected.
*  Saturday's election was held six weeks after the Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi died in
*  a helicopter crash.
*  We'll have more on the election later in the show, going to Tehran.
*  Israel's war on Gaza has entered its tenth month as the official Palestinian death toll
*  has reached nearly 38,200.
*  But a new report in the British medical journal Lancet estimates the actual death toll could
*  be 186,000 or even higher.
*  That's roughly 8 percent of Gaza's population.
*  The report looks at how war leads to indirect deaths due to shortages of medical care, food,
*  shelter and water.
*  Earlier today, Israel attacked the Gaza City headquarters of UNRWA, the UN Palestinian
*  refugee agency.
*  On Saturday, an Israeli airstrike on an UNRWA school killed at least 16 Palestinians and
*  injured 50 others.
*  Eyewitnesses said the dead included many children.
*  We came here running to see the targeted area.
*  We saw bodies of children in pieces.
*  This is a playground.
*  There was a trampoline here.
*  There were swing sets and vendors.
*  Civilians were killed.
*  It's a civilian school.
*  These are United Nations schools for the UNRWA.
*  It is supposed to be safe for people.
*  It should not be targeted any time.
*  On the diplomatic front, Hamas officials have reportedly agreed to a U.S. proposal to begin
*  talks on a new ceasefire and hostage deal.
*  Multiple news outlets report Hamas has dropped its demand that Israel first agree to a permanent
*  ceasefire before any agreement is signed.
*  Meanwhile, the Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Golan, has warned Israel's attacks on Hezbollah
*  in Lebanon will continue even if a truce agreement is reached in the Gaza.
*  In news from the Occupied West Bank, Israel's Supreme Planning Council has approved nearly
*  5,300 new homes for settlers in the West Bank.
*  The group Peace Now, Shalom Arshav, says this will result in the largest single Israeli
*  land grab since the Oslo Accords.
*  On Sunday, Israeli protesters blocked highways across the country as part of nationwide demonstrations
*  calling for a ceasefire and hostage deal, as well as for the resignation of Israeli
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  Meanwhile, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz has revealed new details about how Israeli military
*  officials ordered repeated attacks inside Israel on October 7th in an effort to prevent
*  Hamas from taking hostages into Gaza.
*  It remains unknown how many Israelis killed on that day were actually killed by Israeli
*  forces implementing what's known as the Hannibal Directive.
*  One military source told Haaretz, quote,
*  President Biden's facing more calls from Democratic lawmakers to drop out of the presidential
*  race as questions continue to mount over his mental filthiness.
*  Five members of Congress have publicly called for him to step aside.
*  Four more senior Democratic lawmakers have said so in a private call.
*  Biden's repeatedly vowed to stay in the race.
*  He sat down for an interview on Friday with ABC's George Stephanopoulos, who asked if
*  he could beat Donald Trump.
*  That was from Biden's first televised interview since his disastrous debate with Donald Trump.
*  Biden also spoke to two radio stations, where he was interviewed by hosts who asked him
*  questions that were scripted by Biden's own campaign.
*  Biden still stumbled during the interview, saying at one point that he was proud to be,
*  quote,
*  Boeing has agreed to a plea deal with the Justice Department that will allow it to avoid
*  facing a criminal trial over a pair of deadly 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 19 that killed
*  all 346 people on board.
*  Under the deal, Boeing will plead guilty to a conspiracy fraud charge and pay $243 million
*  in additional fines.
*  A lawyer representing families of passengers killed in the crashes has already filed an
*  objection to the agreement.
*  The attorney, Paul Cassell, said, quote,
*  Through crafty lawyering between Boeing and DOJ, the deadly consequences of Boeing's
*  crime are being hidden, unquote.
*  NATO nations have agreed to provide Ukraine $43 billion in new military aid next year.
*  NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg confirmed the deal ahead of NATO's three-day summit
*  in Washington that begins Tuesday.
*  This comes as Russia continues to attack Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leaving
*  more than 100,000 people without power.
*  Earlier today, Russian strikes killed 29 people, including two who died in an attack
*  on a children's hospital in Kyiv.
*  On Friday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban met with Russian President Vladimir
*  Putin in a trip condemned by Ukraine and EU leaders.
*  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting with Putin today.
*  More than 130 million people in the U.S. were under high heat alerts this weekend as a heat
*  wave intensified in California and other areas.
*  Temperatures could reach 128 degrees Fahrenheit in Death Valley today.
*  Meanwhile, in Northern California, wildfires have forced around 30,000 people from their homes.
*  Hurricane Barrel has made landfall on the Texas coast near Matagorda as a Category 1 storm.
*  About 200,000 people in Houston have already lost power.
*  The storm killed at least 11 people as it battered Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and several
*  Caribbean islands.
*  The storm has been fueled by record temperatures in the Atlantic.
*  A funeral was held Saturday in Utica, New York, for Nyamwe, a 13-year-old boy who was shot to
*  death by police two days after he graduated from middle school.
*  Nyamwe was a refugee born in Burma.
*  His death has shattered the close-knit community of Karen refugees in Utica.
*  His brother wrote online, quote,
*  Our family moved to America nine years ago as refugees from Myanmar
*  to find a better life safe from law enforcement killings and ethnic cleansing, unquote.
*  Three officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave.
*  And the longtime labor organizer and scholar Jane McAlevey has died at the age of 59 of
*  multiple myeloma.
*  Jane McAlevey dedicated her life's work to empowering rank-and-file workers,
*  training tens of thousands around the world to effectively strengthen their unions.
*  She was also a prolific writer, authoring many books and articles, including
*  as the strikes correspondent for The Nation.
*  In April, she sat down here in Democracy Now! Studios for one of her last interviews.
*  You know, the work is going to go on.
*  And that's what makes me happy, is that I did a lot of succession planning.
*  The work is going to go.
*  And if workers just keep winning, one person falls, one soldier goes down.
*  I've always thought of myself as a soldier.
*  You know, one soldier is going to go down in the fight.
*  And there's a ton more soldiers being produced every day in all of these campaigns and all of
*  the training programs.
*  And I do think that they're going to win ultimately.
*  Because people have had it with capitalism in 2024.
*  That was noted labor organizer and scholar Jane McAlevey speaking in April in Democracy
*  Now! Studios.
*  To see our interview and the web exclusive we did afterwards, go to democracynow.org.
*  She died Sunday at the age of 59 in Muir Beach, California.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
