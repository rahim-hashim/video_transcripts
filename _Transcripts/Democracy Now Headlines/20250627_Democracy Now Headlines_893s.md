Over 100 days have passed since the Trump administration’s unprecedented removal of more than 230 immigrants to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison CECOT. They were removed without any due process in the United States. _Democracy Now!_ spoke with the loved ones of Andry Hernández Romero, a 33-year-old gay makeup artist and asylum seeker who was told he would be sent home to Venezuela, according to his mother. But instead, he was sent to CECOT, where reports of torture and abuse are rampant. His mother Alexis Romero and his best friend Reina Cardenas have not seen or heard from him in three months. He has been identified in photos taken at CECOT by a photojournalist. Hernández Romero “was detained from the moment he showed up for his asylum appointment,” says Cardenas. “He never had due process.” Adds Margaret Cargioli, a lawyer for the family, “He sought asylum because he was persecuted due to his political opinion and because he's LGBTQ. … It is quite astonishing that in the United States, people are being disappeared in this manner.”

# Kidnapped to Salvadoran Mega-Prison: Andry Hernández Romero’s Family on 100+ Days of Disappearance
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=0.0s)]
*  It's Pride Month. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  This weekend, major celebrations will be taking place all over the country. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Well, this week also has marked over 100 days since Andres José Hernández Romero and over [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=13.4s)]
*  200 others were sent on a plane without warning or due process to El Salvador. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=20.8s)]
*  They were not deported, but rather sent to El Salvador to be confined in a notorious [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=27.16s)]
*  mega prison known as Secat, the Terrorism Confinement Center, where they have no ability [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=31.64s)]
*  to communicate with the outside world, including with their families or legal counsel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=37.04s)]
*  The Trump administration is paying the Bukele government of El Salvador to hold Andres [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=41.72s)]
*  and the others in Secat, we believe, something like $6 million. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=47.36s)]
*  While they've been described by the administration as the worst of the worst, in fact, the majority [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=52.32s)]
*  of those sent to Secat have no serious criminal history. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=57.8s)]
*  Andres and others have been accused of being a member of the Tren de Ragua gang and sent [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=62.44s)]
*  to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=67.96s)]
*  He's now the lead plaintiff in the case JGG v. Trump, which is seeking the return of Andres [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=70.12s)]
*  and all the men unlawfully sent to El Salvador under this act. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  Andres is a makeup artist. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=81.56s)]
*  He came to the U.S. to seek asylum, but he never set foot in the country and never had [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=83.0s)]
*  a chance to plead his case. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  He was immediately placed in immigration detention here in the U.S., reportedly because of a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  tattoo he has of a crown. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=95.76s)]
*  He spent months in detention before he was sent to El Salvador. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  Andres' family has not heard from him since March, before he boarded the flight. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=104.0s)]
*  He told his mother he was being flown home to Venezuela. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  She only found out he was, in fact, in the Salvador prison when he never arrived home [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=113.72s)]
*  and a week later saw images on the news from Secat, including of her son. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=120.2s)]
*  We're going to go right now to a clip. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=129.2s)]
*  He was soy gay and saying that he was innocent. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=134.6s)]
*  And he was being slapped every time he would speak up, but he just, like he couldn't [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=139.64s)]
*  help himself. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  Then he started praying and calling out, literally crying for his mother. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  His crying out for his mother really touched me. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=150.27999999999997s)]
*  That was Philip Helsinger, who was a photographer who took a photo of Andres with his hair being [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=154.11999999999998s)]
*  cut as he cried out for his mother. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=162.6s)]
*  We're joined now by Margaret Cargioli, who is representing Andres, as well as eight others [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=165.84s)]
*  as their immigration attorney. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=172.08s)]
*  She's the directing attorney of the Policy and Advocacy at Immigrant Defenders Law Center. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=173.72s)]
*  Thanks for coming in from New Jersey. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=178.64s)]
*  Explain what's happened. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=180.6s)]
*  Where is he? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=182.56s)]
*  Unfortunately, it's been 105 days since over 200 men, including Andres, were—disappeared [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=183.56s)]
*  from the United States to El Salvador and to Secat. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=192.12s)]
*  Immigration attorneys, attorneys have not been able to have any direct contact with [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=196.8s)]
*  Andres. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=200.24s)]
*  His family was not able to see him, and they have not been able to speak with him directly. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=201.68s)]
*  Since they were sent there, we have been fighting in immigration court to keep his case alive, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  but unfortunately, in many of these cases, the immigration judges have dismissed their [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=212.4s)]
*  cases, essentially closing them, even though we've argued that their due process rights [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=218.32s)]
*  were violated. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=222.8s)]
*  They were in the middle of their immigration proceedings, and these cases should continue [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=224.08s)]
*  to stay alive because they should be returned to have their right to defend their cases, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=228.72s)]
*  seek asylum and keep their temporary protective status, for example. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=233.56s)]
*  I want to go to Andres' mother and his best friend. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=238.56s)]
*  On Wednesday evening, Democracy Now! reached Andres Hernández Romero's mother, Alexis [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=244.7s)]
*  Romero, and his best friend, Reina Cardenas. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=250.82s)]
*  They were speaking from Andres' hometown in Venezuela of Capacho. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=255.66s)]
*  Reina went with some people recently, family members of those held in Secat, to El Salvador [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=261.94s)]
*  to try to meet with Andres. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=270.82s)]
*  But they were denied that ability. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=275.98s)]
*  Reina filed a petition to visit Andres, languishing in Secat, without any communication for over [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=278.94s)]
*  three months now. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=285.74s)]
*  Her petition denied. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  Andres' loved ones continue to demand for his release and immediate proof he's still [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=288.34000000000003s)]
*  alive, and they haven't been able to speak to him since he was put on that plane from [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=292.3s)]
*  Texas to El Salvador. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=298.1s)]
*  My son is everything to me. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=300.38000000000005s)]
*  He is a young man who is very introverted, a person who loves to learn, who loves to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=307.26000000000005s)]
*  help other people. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=313.5s)]
*  He is a homebody and 100% supportive of his dad, his brother, and me, his mom. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=315.66s)]
*  Andres last called me on March 14th at 6.30 in the afternoon, telling me he was coming [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=326.74s)]
*  home, that they were going to transfer him to another detention center in Texas, where [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=333.3s)]
*  the plane was going to bring them to Venezuela. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=339.09999999999997s)]
*  The plane was carrying all of the other innocent young men. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  But the plane didn't come here. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=346.5s)]
*  It was sent to El Salvador. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  I found out my son was there the following Thursday. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  From then on, our lives changed. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  We were so happy waiting for him to come home so that all of his trauma would end. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=359.79999999999995s)]
*  Instead, everything got worse. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  Andres and I were in touch when he was in detention in the United States. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=373.4s)]
*  He basically never entered the U.S. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  He was detained from the moment he showed up for his asylum appointment. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=380.03999999999996s)]
*  That's when this process began. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=383.88s)]
*  One day, he called me and said, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=386.02s)]
*  Reyna, they're linking me to Tren de Aragua. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=388.0s)]
*  I need you to get me photos, all the documentation from the three wise men because of the Crowns. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=390.0s)]
*  I sent these documents and evidence so that he could defend himself, something U.S. authorities [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=396.0s)]
*  never gave him the right to do. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=401.79999999999995s)]
*  He never had due process. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=403.7s)]
*  I've known Andres since we were kids. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=408.0s)]
*  I'm older than him. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=410.76s)]
*  I'm 36, and he's 32. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=411.76s)]
*  We've been neighbors for over 20 years. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=414.04s)]
*  We also have relatives in common. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=416.32s)]
*  We spent so much time together. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=418.3s)]
*  We drank coffee. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=420.16s)]
*  We went out to dinner. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=421.34s)]
*  We would hang out here at my house. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=422.64s)]
*  He did my makeup. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=424.56s)]
*  He was my confidant, and I was his confidant. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=425.56s)]
*  We had a very close relationship, more than a friendship, like siblings. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=428.82s)]
*  We also worked for the same Three Wise Men Foundation, where Andres has been an actor [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=435.64s)]
*  for 25 years. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=440.2s)]
*  This is the festivity, the Capacho Three Kings Foundation, which has been in existence for [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=442.88s)]
*  108 years. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=447.52s)]
*  We are part of the artistic, cultural and religious heritage of the municipality, this [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=449.32s)]
*  state and Venezuela. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=454.08s)]
*  It has a long history, and Andres has participated as an actor since he was seven years old. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=455.96s)]
*  He has participated as an actor, stylist, makeup artist and costume designer. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=462.08s)]
*  If we don't fight for him, who will? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=469.72s)]
*  This is all so painful. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=472.16s)]
*  We need Andres to know that he is not alone. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=473.94s)]
*  When my son left to the United States, he would tell me and his dad that he's going [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=479.96000000000004s)]
*  to help us and that he would make his dream come true, to have his own salon. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=485.0s)]
*  And they thwarted all of that. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=492.20000000000005s)]
*  They stepped on him, ran him over, completely shut down his dream. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=494.72s)]
*  Now what is my boy going to do? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=501.96s)]
*  My message to Andres is that I love him, that I want him to come home, that I want him to [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=510.0s)]
*  be strong. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=517.32s)]
*  He is a warrior. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=518.32s)]
*  His dad, his brother and I are eagerly waiting for him. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=520.32s)]
*  We are doing everything in our power to bring him home. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=526.44s)]
*  And the United States government claims to be law-abiding, democratic and committed to [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=531.36s)]
*  justice and the law, but it isn't. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=537.7600000000001s)]
*  There is no evidence that this is happening. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=540.1600000000001s)]
*  That was Reyna Cardenas, Andres' best friend, and Alexis Romero, his mother, speaking from [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=543.7600000000001s)]
*  their hometown of Capacho in Venezuela. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=549.58s)]
*  Joining to Democracy Now! is María Inés Taracena and Nicole Salazar. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=553.52s)]
*  Special thanks. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=560.08s)]
*  We are in the studio with Andres' lawyer, Margaret Carghioli. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=561.84s)]
*  How is this possible? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  The tattoos that supposedly the Trump administration has used—he was in a legal process in this [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  Trump detention center seeking asylum. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=578.4s)]
*  There is a tattoo on either hand of mom and dad, and they have a crown, as just described, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=582.28s)]
*  because he lives in this town of king pageantry? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=588.92s)]
*  Yeah, so unfortunately in many of these cases, because of having just benign tattoos, tattoos [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=592.96s)]
*  that many people have, such as a crown that says mom or dad, they accused him of being [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=599.52s)]
*  part of Tender Agua. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=606.44s)]
*  They presented no other records, no criminal records, no arrest records, just photos that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=608.0s)]
*  they assume are connected to Tender Agua. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=614.32s)]
*  So explain what the judge has said in this case, Judge Boesberg. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=617.2s)]
*  Yeah, so in the JGG v. Trump case, it's a federal court case, recently Judge Boesberg [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=619.76s)]
*  said that the men's rights were violated when they were sent to El Salvador and that [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=624.72s)]
*  the United States government needs to facilitate their due process rights. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=630.04s)]
*  They need to present evidence as to how they're going to give them right. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=634.28s)]
*  For example, to habeas. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=637.8s)]
*  We believe that they need to be returned to the United States in order to be afforded [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=639.12s)]
*  those rights. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=643.92s)]
*  And his best friend, Reyna, just tried to get to see him in El Salvador and couldn't, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=646.12s)]
*  along with other relatives? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=652.92s)]
*  She was denied? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=654.1999999999999s)]
*  Yes, unfortunately, their family, friends, attorneys have had no direct access to any [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  of the men that were sent to CICOT. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=662.38s)]
*  It's extremely concerning and alarming because we are not getting any information as to what's [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=665.6400000000001s)]
*  happening in their daily lives, as to their conditions. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=671.36s)]
*  We know that Matt Gaetz recently went— [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=676.2s)]
*  Matt Gaetz, the former disgraced congress member. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=678.84s)]
*  Correct. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=681.0s)]
*  Now a podcaster? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=682.0s)]
*  Yes, went to CICOT, walked through while these men were pleading for their freedom, making [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=683.0s)]
*  universal hand signals, SOS signals, asking for help, saying they were kidnapped. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=689.36s)]
*  And he just walks through with other representatives, and that is the only video footage that we've [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=696.96s)]
*  seen of some of these men, including one of our clients. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=703.6s)]
*  And why did Andri seek asylum here? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=705.96s)]
*  Going through the correct process? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=709.36s)]
*  Yes, Andri last entered the United States with a CBP-1 appointment. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=711.0s)]
*  He sought asylum because he was persecuted due to his political opinion and because he's [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=715.08s)]
*  LGBTQ+. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=720.6800000000001s)]
*  He had the right to seek asylum in the United States. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=722.08s)]
*  I mean, the endless pictures of him as a hairdresser with models and that he so proudly put online. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=724.12s)]
*  Yes, you know, in the reports that have come out about many of these men, you know, their [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=730.36s)]
*  parents have shown photos to evidence who they were, where they worked. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=736.44s)]
*  These are real human beings who we know have no criminal records, no ties to Trender Agua, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=741.64s)]
*  but they've been silenced, purposefully silenced by the United States government. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=748.72s)]
*  We're about to go to the former head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Pramila [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=751.72s)]
*  Jayapal. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=755.48s)]
*  She is standing by in Washington. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=757.04s)]
*  But I want to ask you about one more of your, a number of your clients, and that is Miguel. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=759.84s)]
*  Where is he? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=766.12s)]
*  Miguel Rojas Mendoza is one of our clients. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=767.12s)]
*  He had a hearing yesterday where I represented him virtually at immigration court. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=770.88s)]
*  For the second time at a hearing where I asked exactly where he was deported, the government [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=776.48s)]
*  has told me that they cannot provide it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=782.96s)]
*  They confirmed he was removed from the United States, but refused to say exactly where he [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=786.0s)]
*  is. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=790.96s)]
*  I asked the immigration judge. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=791.96s)]
*  He doesn't have a criminal record. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=792.96s)]
*  Correct. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=793.96s)]
*  He has no convictions. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=794.96s)]
*  He was apparently accused of Tender Agua because he also has benign tattoos. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=797.56s)]
*  And in many of these cases, the government is seeking to dismiss them, close their immigration [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=802.8399999999999s)]
*  cases. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=807.24s)]
*  But explain. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=808.24s)]
*  You were having a hearing in court yesterday, and they would not say where they sent this [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=809.24s)]
*  man to? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=816.68s)]
*  It is almost incredible to believe that yesterday in a United States immigration court hearing, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=818.4s)]
*  I had to ask for these details, and it was not provided to me. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=823.5600000000001s)]
*  I was told that I need to send an email, it was provided an email address where I could [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=827.4s)]
*  try to obtain more information. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=832.52s)]
*  About where Miguel was sent to? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=834.84s)]
*  What country he was sent to. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=836.76s)]
*  But they admit that they kidnapped him, that they took him and sent him out of the country. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=838.12s)]
*  They did finally in this court hearing admit that he was removed. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=842.64s)]
*  You know, it is quite astonishing that in the United States people are being disappeared [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=846.64s)]
*  in this manner, and we're continuing to see these egregious immigration policies taking [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=851.6s)]
*  place all throughout the country where people are literally being kidnapped and families [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=857.52s)]
*  cannot find where their loved ones are. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=862.44s)]
*  Margaret Cargaglia, I want to thank you for being with us. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=864.48s)]
*  We'll be in touch with you again, directing attorney of policy and advocacy at Immigrant [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=866.52s)]
*  Defenders Law Center, joining us here in New York. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=870.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhIIxj3N_xA&t=881.6s)]
