Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, was questioned by lawmakers Tuesday in his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, which largely focused on his decades of anti-vaccine activism, as well as his views on abortion and other healthcare issues. We play excerpts from the contentious hearing and speak with the ranking Democrat on the committee, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who says Democrats successfully highlighted his controversial views, potentially putting his confirmation at risk despite the Republican majority in the Senate. "This is one of the most important positions in the world as it relates to healthcare," says Wyden. "He cannot be trusted, … and he's unprepared." Kennedy faces a second day of questioning today before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.

*  and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=54.94s)]
*  Services. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=59.739999999999995s)]
*  In a moment, we'll be joined by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=60.739999999999995s)]
*  of the Senate Finance Committee. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=66.12s)]
*  But first, let's turn to Senator Wyden questioning Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on Wednesday. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=68.22s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy, you have spent years pushing conflicting stories about vaccines. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  You say one thing and then you say another. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=82.66s)]
*  In your testimony today under oath, you denied that you were anti-vaccine. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=85.61999999999999s)]
*  But during a podcast interview in July of 2023, you said, quote, no vaccine is safe [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=90.94s)]
*  and effective. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=97.3s)]
*  In your testimony today, in order to prove you're not anti-vax, you note that all your [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=98.88s)]
*  kids are vaccinated. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=104.69999999999999s)]
*  But in a podcast in 2020, you said, and I quote, you would do anything, pay anything [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=108.22s)]
*  to go back in time and not vaccinate your kids. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=114.66s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy, all of these things cannot be true. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=118.78s)]
*  So are you lying to Congress today when you say you are pro-vaccine or did you lie on [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=125.82s)]
*  all those podcasts? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=132.52s)]
*  We have all of this on tape, by the way. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=133.92s)]
*  Senator, as you know, because it's been repeatedly debunked, that statement that I made on the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  Lackus Friedman podcast was a fragment of the statement. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=143.74s)]
*  He asked me, and anybody who actually goes and looks at that podcast will see this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=147.9s)]
*  He asked me, are there vaccines that are safe and effective? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=154.7s)]
*  And I said to him, some of the live virus vaccines are. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=157.66s)]
*  And I said, there are no vaccines that are safe and effective. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=161.84s)]
*  And I was going to continue for every person. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=165.16s)]
*  Every medicine has people who are sensitive to them, including vaccines. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=168.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=173.24s)]
*  So he interrupted me at that point. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=174.24s)]
*  I've corrected it many times, including on national TV. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=176.56s)]
*  You know about this, Senator Wyden. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=180.16s)]
*  So bringing this up right now is dishonest. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=181.92s)]
*  Let's be clear about what you've actually done then since you want to deny your statements. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=184.84s)]
*  For example, you have a history of trying to take vaccines away from people. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=191.38s)]
*  In May of 2021, you petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to not only block Americans [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=197.82s)]
*  from having access to the covid vaccine, but to prevent any future access to the life saving [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=204.34s)]
*  vaccine. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=212.16s)]
*  Are you denying that? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=213.16s)]
*  Your name is on the petition. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=214.16s)]
*  We brought that petition after CDC recommended the covid vaccine without any scientific basis. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=216.86s)]
*  For six year old children, most experts agree today, even the people who did it back then, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=227.10000000000002s)]
*  that covid vaccines are inappropriate for six year old children who basically have a [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=234.82000000000002s)]
*  zero risk from covid. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=240.06s)]
*  That's why I brought that lawsuit. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=242.9s)]
*  I don't want to. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=245.42s)]
*  I want to emphasize this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=246.42s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy, the facts— [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=247.42s)]
*  I don't—the facts— [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=248.42s)]
*  That was Democratic Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=263.42s)]
*  He's the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, questioning President Trump's [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=266.38s)]
*  to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., when he appeared [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=271.82s)]
*  before the committee on Wednesday. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=276.18s)]
*  That was a brief interruption by a protester. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=278.5s)]
*  Senator Wyden is joining us now from the Russell Rotunda in the Senate Office Building. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=281.5s)]
*  He also has a new book just out. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=285.98s)]
*  It's called It Takes Chutzpah, How to Fight Fearlessly for Progressive Change. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=288.34s)]
*  Senator, welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=293.58s)]
*  It's great to have you with us. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  If you can start off by just talking about the significance of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=297.58s)]
*  heading up Health and Human Services in charge of NIH, in charge of the Centers for Disease [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=304.21999999999997s)]
*  Control, agencies that he has long fiercely criticized. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=310.06s)]
*  Amy, this is one of the most important positions in the world as it relates to healthcare, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=314.82s)]
*  A lot of the decisions we make on medicines and therapies are copied around the world. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=322.62s)]
*  I was listening to what you played and what you heard was vintage Robert Kennedy double [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=328.82s)]
*  talk. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=335.38s)]
*  You know, he has tried so hard to be anti-vax and again and again and again. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=336.38s)]
*  He belongs to organizations. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=342.66s)]
*  He makes statements and the like. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=344.54s)]
*  Now he desperately wants disappointment from Donald Trump, so he is trying to pretend that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=346.22s)]
*  he is pro-vax. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=351.70000000000005s)]
*  I think the reality is that he cannot be trusted, number one, and he is unprepared. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=353.06s)]
*  The reason I say unprepared is it was clear yesterday he didn't even understand the Medicaid [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=359.86s)]
*  program. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=364.94000000000005s)]
*  He thought that there were premiums involved and it was clear that he just didn't understand [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=365.94000000000005s)]
*  the architecture of the programs he would run if confirmed. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=371.90000000000003s)]
*  Senator Wyden, you've said that he's, quote, embraced conspiracy theories, quacks and charlatans [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=375.98s)]
*  on vaccine safety and efficacy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=381.46000000000004s)]
*  What is your assessment on the line of questioning yesterday? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=384.66s)]
*  Were you satisfied with the number of questions you were able to ask and others were able [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=388.18s)]
*  to ask? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=392.38s)]
*  And what remains? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=393.38s)]
*  I believe my Democratic colleagues were outstanding. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=394.38s)]
*  They went at all of the issues where he had made these very outlandish statements. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=398.42s)]
*  He pretends that he didn't. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=403.66s)]
*  A number of my colleagues looked at the financial links that he benefits from when he's doing [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=405.98s)]
*  all this anti-vax activity. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=412.18s)]
*  I think that we put on the kind of hearing on our side that puts him on the precipice [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=414.5s)]
*  where possibly he will not be confirmed. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=420.74s)]
*  I mean, on the one hand, you have his fierce criticism of vaccines and surprise many, probably, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=423.06s)]
*  when he said he was not anti-vaccine, but he also has fierce criticism of the agriculture [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=430.26s)]
*  industry, the power of the drug industry. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=435.82s)]
*  Can you comment on that, where you actually agree with him and where you don't? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=438.58s)]
*  Certainly, when he talks about tobacco cessation, I was the one who blew the whistle on the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=443.21999999999997s)]
*  tobacco executives lying about the addictiveness of nicotine. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=449.41999999999996s)]
*  I certainly share views with him on matters like that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=453.26s)]
*  But on the big, crucial kinds of questions, for example, this COVID petition, you know, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=457.41999999999996s)]
*  that would have made it impossible to get out the services that were so needed while [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=464.7s)]
*  we were in the eye of the storm. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=470.09999999999997s)]
*  And his policies, I think, are going to leave Americans sicker. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boq-fauCOHs&t=472.42s)]
