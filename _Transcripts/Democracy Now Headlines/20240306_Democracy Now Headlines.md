# Top U.S. & World Headlines — March 6, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [March 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3HipZlIZBY)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  President Biden and Donald Trump appear headed for a rematch in November, after both candidates
*  won nearly every race on Super Tuesday, when millions of voters in 15 states went to the
*  polls.
*  Trump's only remaining rival, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, is expected
*  to drop out of the race today after beating Trump in just Vermont on Tuesday.
*  Biden won every Democratic contest on Super Tuesday, except American Samoa, where he
*  lost to a little-known tech investor named Jason Palmer.
*  Despite Biden's victories, many Democratic voters continue to show dismay over his support
*  for Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  In Minnesota, 19 percent of voters in the Democratic primary chose uncommitted.
*  About 12 percent of voters cast ballots for no preference in North Carolina, as did 9
*  percent in Massachusetts.
*  During an interview Tuesday, Donald Trump broke his silence on the war in Gaza by openly
*  endorsing Israel's actions.
*  He spoke to Fox News host Brian Kilmeade.
*  The non-committed vote that Biden's getting, they're not going to like you either because
*  you are firmly in Israel's camp, correct?
*  Are you on board with the way the IDF is taking the fight in Gaza?
*  You've got to finish the problem.
*  You had a horrible invasion.
*  It took place.
*  It would have never happened if I was president, by the way.
*  Over the weekend, Trump reportedly met with billionaire Elon Musk in Mar-a-Lago, one of
*  the world's richest men.
*  Trump's seeking to boost his fundraising at a time when he's at risk of losing much
*  of his personal fortune.
*  Democratic Congressmembers Katie Porter and Barbara Lee placed third and fourth in the
*  California Senate primary.
*  Lee was the only candidate on the ballot who supports a ceasefire in Gaza.
*  North Carolina's Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson has won the state's Republican
*  gubernatorial primary, and this NBC described him as a holocaust-denying, gay-bashing,
*  extreme anti-abortion radical.
*  The human rights campaign said Robinson was one of the most radical anti-LGBTQ-plus MAGA
*  politicians on the ballot for making comments like this one from 2021.
*  The transgender movement in this country, if there's a movement in this country that
*  is demonic and that is full of the spirit of anti-Christ, it is the transgender movement.
*  And these same people are going to tell me, you need to believe in global warming.
*  And then they tell me, follow the signs.
*  Follow the signs.
*  You don't even know what gender you are.
*  Last week, Donald Trump praised Mark Robinson, who's African-American, saying, quote,
*  I think you are Martin Luther King times two, unquote.
*  In November, Robinson will face off against Josh Stein, who won the Democratic primary
*  in North Carolina.
*  In another closely watched race, Colin Allred won the Democratic Senate primary in Texas,
*  defeating State Senator Roland Guccheres and others.
*  Allred will face Republican Ted Cruz in November.
*  The World Food Program has accused the Israeli military of blocking the agency from delivering
*  crucial aid needed to avert a famine in northern Gaza.
*  Health officials in Gaza say at least 18 children have died from starvation in recent days.
*  The Biden administration is defending its decision to keep sending arms to Israel, even
*  though it's blocking aid deliveries.
*  National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby was questioned at the White House on
*  Tuesday.
*  What is preventing the president from communicating to the Israeli government that if they don't
*  allow aid, we will not continue supplying weapons?
*  Why is that not a fair trade?
*  No aid, no bombs.
*  Because the president still believes that it's important for Israel to have what it
*  needs to defend itself against a still viable Hamas threat.
*  Maybe some people have forgotten what happened on the 7th of October, but President Biden
*  has not.
*  Palestinians in Gaza say the lack of aid is leading people to take drastic actions to
*  feed their families.
*  We have the willingness and ability to bear it, but is there a father in the world who
*  can see his children reading in hunger in front of him and remain silent, even if the
*  price is risking his life, just like all these people who risk their lives in order to obtain
*  what is not even enough for a crumb of flour or aid or canned food?
*  Yesterday, some expired canned goods arrived containing mold and fungus.
*  We are not animals, as they described us.
*  On the diplomatic front, negotiations are continuing in Cairo, Egypt, over a possible
*  ceasefire.
*  A TAP Hamas official said Tuesday the group will not release any more hostages until there's
*  a permanent ceasefire.
*  We reiterate that what the enemy failed to achieve on the battlefield, he will not achieve
*  at the negotiating table.
*  The security and safety of our people will not be achieved except with a permanent ceasefire,
*  the end of the aggression and the withdrawal of the enemy from every inch of the Gaza Strip.
*  Providing urgent and appropriate shelter and bringing aid to our people in Gaza is our
*  top priority, and any exchange of prisoners cannot take place before all of this is achieved.
*  That senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, Israel bombed a home in southern Lebanon Tuesday,
*  reportedly killing a Hezbollah fighter along with his wife and son.
*  The attack came as U.S. special envoy Amos Hoekstein was visiting Beirut, where he warned
*  that a war between Lebanon and Israel would not be containable and could spread across
*  the region.
*  The World Food Program has warned the ongoing conflict in Sudan could trigger the world's
*  largest hunger crisis unless fighting between the Sudanese military and rapid support forces
*  comes to an end.
*  Agency officials said Wednesday more than 25 million people scattered across Sudan,
*  South Sudan and Chad, are facing severe food insecurity.
*  Meanwhile, worsening violence has blocked humanitarian aid workers from accessing most
*  of Sudanese communities experiencing emergency levels of hunger.
*  Deliveries from Chad and to western Sudan border have been halted after Sudan's Ministry
*  of Foreign Affairs said there were concerns RSF fighters had carried out arms transfers
*  in that border.
*  Haiti's most powerful gang leader has warned Haiti is heading to a civil war unless Haiti's
*  deeply unpopular, unelected prime minister, Ariel Henry, resigns as a violent uprising
*  continues to grow in Port-au-Prince.
*  On Tuesday, Henry landed in Puerto Rico, after apparently being unable to fly back to Haiti,
*  where armed groups attacked the international airport Monday.
*  Henry left Haiti last week for Kenya, where he discussed a deal to bring a U.N. force
*  of 1,000 Kenyan police to the island nation.
*  Haitian gang leader Jimmy Cherizier, known as Barbecue, issued a new threat to Henry.
*  If Ariel Henry doesn't step down, the country will suffer a genocide.
*  If he doesn't step down, if the international community continues to support him, they will
*  lead us directly into a civil war that will end in genocide.
*  The international community, especially the United States, Canada, France and the core
*  group, will be responsible for all the people who die in Haiti.
*  To see our segment on Haiti, go to democracynow.org.
*  On Tuesday, Doctors Without Borders announced it would scale up its medical operations in
*  Port-au-Prince.
*  The group said the recent violence has led to a massive number of casualties.
*  The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for two high-ranking Russian
*  military officers for targeting civilians and attacking civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.
*  ICC chief prosecutor Hreem Khan spoke Tuesday.
*  This afternoon, pre-trial chamber two of the International Criminal Court issued two arrest
*  warrants relating to Lieutenant General Sergei Kobalash, commander of long-range aviation
*  of the Russian armed forces, and Admiral Victor Sokolov, commander of the Black Sea Fleet
*  of the Russian Federation.
*  In news from Capitol Hill, independent Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema has announced she will
*  not seek reelection this year.
*  This comes just over a year after she left the Democratic Party, after years of shifting
*  further to the right.
*  Sinema was widely criticized by Democrats for voting against changing filibuster rules
*  to pass key voting rights measures and efforts to raise taxes on corporations.
*  Her departure paves the way for a high-stakes Senate seat match, likely between Democratic
*  Congressmember Ruben Gallego and Arizona's former Republican gubernatorial candidate
*  Kerry Lake, who supported Trump's false claims of election fraud.
*  In other Senate news, New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez and his wife have been charged
*  with obstruction of justice in a new 18-count superseding indictment as part of a sweeping
*  case centered on bribes tied to Egypt and Qatar.
*  Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is facing new controversy after reports he hired
*  a law clerk who was previously found to have sent racist text messages.
*  Crystal Clanton was the field director at the conservative student group Turning Point
*  USA when she sent the messages, including one that said,
*  "'I hate Black people.'"
*  Justice Thomas has come out in defense of Clanton, who graduated from the Antonin Scalia
*  Law School at George Mason University, which has long had ties to conservative donors and
*  has maintained close relationships with Supreme Court justices.
*  In its historic victory for college sports, the Dartmouth men's basketball team is voted
*  to unionize.
*  The players voted 13-2 to join service employees International Union Local 560.
*  This comes as Dartmouth is seeking to overturn a February decision by the National Labor
*  Relations Board classifying the basketball players as employees of the university, which
*  granted them the right to unionize.
*  In other education news, the Evangelical Christian School Liberty University has agreed
*  to pay an unprecedented $14 million federal fine for failing to report sexual assaults
*  and other crimes on its campus.
*  It's the largest fine ever levied under the federal Clery Act.
*  And in Germany, a militant left-wing group has claimed responsibility for cutting off
*  power and shutting down production at Tesla's largest electric car factory in Europe, which
*  Tesla is hoping to expand.
*  The factory could remain shut down for a week after an electricity pylon caught on fire.
*  The leftist volcano group took credit for the sabotage, saying, quote,
*  The factory contaminates the groundwater and consumes huge quantities of the already scarce
*  drinking water resource for its products.
*  Tesla is a symbol for green capitalism, they said.
*  Over 100 people recently set up an encampment inside a nearby forest to protest Tesla's
*  plans to expand the factory.
*  We're here in Grünheide in Brandenburg, and I've occupied this forest because Tesla,
*  which is building electronic cars here in the Gigafactory 4, also wants to buy and clear
*  this adjourning area of forest.
*  We have occupied this forest to stop this.
*  And those are some of the headlines.

*  Hi, Juan.
*  Hi, Amy, and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around
*  the world.
