# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” June 18, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdocnRxAB4)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  At least 17 Palestinians were killed in the Gaza Strip overnight after Israeli warplanes
*  launched airstrikes on homes in the Nusayrat and B'rej refugee camps.
*  This came after at least nine Palestinians were reported killed in another Israeli attack
*  while waiting for aid trucks to arrive in the southern city of Raqqa.
*  This is Um Hamad Dalloul, the aunt of one of the men killed in the strike.
*  They are merchants.
*  They had nothing to do with anything.
*  They were struck with missiles.
*  There's no safety, no safety.
*  These are innocent people, honest people who had nothing to do with anything.
*  They killed the merchants.
*  They killed people.
*  They killed children.
*  They killed women.
*  They have mistreated us.
*  In Jerusalem, at least one person was wounded and nine others arrested Monday night as thousands
*  of protesters rallied near the home of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  Among those detained was a family member of an Israeli taken hostage by Hamas.
*  It was one of dozens of protests taking place across Israel this week demanding immediate
*  elections and a Gaza ceasefire.
*  This is 26-year-old Yotam Kolen, whose brother remains a hostage in Gaza.
*  The last eight months have been an emotional rollercoaster for me and the other hostage
*  families, and I think that without a struggle and without the protests, this deal will also
*  be put down.
*  And we're here to tell the government and shout for them to close the deal and to bring
*  them out.
*  The chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee has agreed to back the sale of $18 billion
*  worth of F-15 fighter jets and other arms to Israel following intense pressure from
*  the Biden administration.
*  New York Congressmember Gregory Meeks had previously held up the weapons sales after
*  objecting to Israel's attacks on civilians.
*  Maryland Democrat and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Ben Cardin has also signed
*  off on the sales.
*  This comes as a French court has reversed a ruling that would have seen Israeli weapons
*  traders barred from the world's largest arms expo.
*  The EuroSatury exhibition opened in Paris Monday without the participation of Israeli
*  delegates and intermediaries after peace activists successfully argued a government ban on Israeli
*  companies operating booths at the event didn't go far enough.
*  Earlier today, however, a commercial court reversed that decision.
*  The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, known as ICANN, is calling on the
*  world's nuclear powers to stop ratcheting up tensions as a new report shows a surge
*  in nuclear weapons spending.
*  In a recent interview, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance
*  is weighing, quote, how many nuclear warheads should be operational and which should be
*  stored, unquote.
*  The U.S. currently has nuclear weapons deployed in Italy, Germany, Turkey, Belgium and the
*  Netherlands, while Russia has recently deployed warheads to Belarus.
*  ICANN said, quote, the NATO countries hosting U.S. nuclear weapons should admit to their
*  citizens that they have these inhumane weapons on their soil without their say.
*  No country should be demonstrating their willingness to join in the killing of millions of people,
*  they said.
*  On Monday, Stoltenberg visited President Biden at the White House and spoke at the Wilson
*  Center think tank, where he boasted of NATO's increased weapons spending.
*  NATO creates a market for defense sales.
*  Over the last two years, more than two-thirds of European defense acquisitions were made
*  with U.S. firms.
*  That is more than 140 billion U.S. dollars worth of contracts for U.S. defense companies.
*  So NATO is good for U.S. security, good for U.S. industry and good for U.S. jobs.
*  That's the NATO secretary general.
*  South Korea's military says its soldiers fired warning shots at about two dozen North
*  Korean troops who crossed the heavily fortified demilitarized zone separating the two countries.
*  It was the second reported border incursion this month and came as Russian President Vladimir
*  Putin departed for a state visit to Pyongyang, where he set to meet North Korean leader Kim
*  Jong-un to discuss trade, weapons sales and military assistance.
*  It's Putin's first visit to North Korea since 2000.
*  In India, residents of New Delhi remain under a red alert, the highest level of warning,
*  with daytime temperatures soaring past 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
*  Meteorologists say northern India is in the midst of its longest ever heat wave, with
*  highs in some areas pushing the limits of what humans can survive.
*  In Saudi Arabia, at least 14 Muslim worshippers have died of heat stroke during the Hajj pilgrimage
*  to Mecca.
*  On Sunday, temperatures around the Great Mosque of Mecca reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit.
*  In North America, an estimated 260 million people in the U.S. and Canada face temperatures
*  of 90 degrees or higher this week as a persistent heat dome is forecast to settle over cities,
*  including Chicago, New York and Toronto.
*  Meanwhile, in western states, crews are battling fresh wildfires that have exploded in Los
*  California's Sonoma County, as well as New Mexico and elsewhere.
*  This comes as dozens of labor and environmental groups petition the Federal Emergency Management
*  Agency Monday to include wildfires and extreme heat in its definition of a major disaster,
*  as both events are set to get even more frequent and more destructive due to the worsening
*  climate crisis.
*  The European Union has approved a landmark environmental law that will require the bloc's
*  27 member states to restore nature on at least one-fifth of their land and sea by 2030.
*  Over 80 percent of Europe's natural habitats are considered to be in poor health.
*  At least 11 asylum seekers have died, and dozens are missing after two shipwrecks off
*  the southern coast of Italy.
*  Over 50 migrants were rescued Monday from a sinking wooden boat, while another boat,
*  which had set off from Turkey, caught fire and overturned.
*  Many of the refugees came from Syria, Egypt, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
*  The International Organization for Migration estimates more than 27,000 migrants have died
*  in the Mediterranean Sea over the last decade as they attempt to reach Europe from northern
*  Africa.
*  The Biden administration is announcing a new policy that will protect tens of thousands
*  of undocumented immigrants who are married to U.S. citizens from deportation and grant
*  them a pathway to citizenship.
*  The measure is likely to benefit some half a million people who have lived in the United
*  States for at least 10 years and who would otherwise face mounting bureaucratic and legal
*  challenges to obtain these protections if they entered the U.S. unauthorized.
*  They'll also be allowed to obtain work permits.
*  President Biden is announcing the policy at the White House later today, marking the
*  12th anniversary of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which provides deportation
*  relief for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.
*  This comes just weeks after Biden issued a measure temporarily shutting down the U.S.-Mexico
*  border and denying asylum to most migrants who do not cross into the U.S. via ports of
*  entry.
*  Here in New York, Governor Kathy Hochul has come under fire from health experts after
*  saying she's exploring whether to reinstitute a partial ban on face coverings in public
*  spaces.
*  Hochul's comments came during an interview on CNN where she was asked by reporter Laura
*  Coats if she would support a call by Jewish leaders to ban masks so pro-Palestinian protesters
*  can be more easily identified.
*  I absolutely will go back and take a look at this and see whether it can be restored,
*  because it is frightening to people.
*  You're sitting on a subway train and someone puts on a mask like this and comes in.
*  You don't know if they're going to be committing a crime, they're going to have a gun, or
*  whether they're just going to be threatening and intimidating you because you are Jewish,
*  which is exactly what happened the other day.
*  Absolutely unacceptable in the state of New York.
*  New York City Councilmember Shahana Hanif called the governor's comments inexplicable
*  and said a mask ban would, quote, serve to appease reactionary voices and go against
*  logical health protections.
*  Mask bans won't deter crime, but only hinder public health, Councilmember Hanif said.
*  New York City Mayor Eric Adams has also backed a possible mask ban, citing protests as well
*  as crimes committed by masked people.
*  Meanwhile, New York City Comptroller Grad Lander and others say they will bring legal
*  challenges to Governor Hochul's halting of New York City's congestion charge plan,
*  which would charge drivers $15 to enter parts of Manhattan.
*  The plan, which had been scheduled to go into effect later this month, would put billions
*  back into New York City's ailing public transportation system and significantly reduce car pollution.
*  A federal judge Monday blocked the Biden administration's expanded Title IX protections in Kentucky,
*  Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.
*  The federal regulation was recently expanded to increase civil rights protections for transgender
*  students, students who experience sex discrimination and harassment, and for pregnant people and
*  survivors of sexual assault in schools.
*  Days earlier, another federal judge temporarily blocked the new rules from taking effect in
*  Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi and Montana.
*  Title IX compliance is required to receive federal education assistance, but Republican
*  states have been fighting against this expansion of protections for trans children.
*  Thailand's Senate has overwhelmingly approved a marriage equality bill, making it the first
*  country in Southeast Asia to recognize same-sex and non-binary couples.
*  If Thailand's King grants final approval, the new law will allow any two people age
*  18 or older to wed and grants them equal rights to adopt children, inherit property, claim
*  tax breaks and more.
*  This is 18-year-old Playa Fak Yoka Shadlad, who helped draft the marriage equality bill.
*  Thank you for all your determination to see this same-sex marriage bill through.
*  This is not just about amending a law.
*  It is also going to change the lives of those in the LGBTQ community and their families.
*  As an 18-year-old non-binary youth, this is an important step for society and for our
*  future.
*  We are very proud to make history today where love triumphed over prejudice.
*  And after half a century behind bars, former Black Panther, Veronza Bowers, has been released.
*  He was sentenced to life in prison in 1973 for the murder of a U.S. park ranger based
*  on testimony from government informants.
*  He's consistently claimed his innocence.
*  Many call him one of the longest-serving political prisoners in U.S. history.
*  He was freed in May from the Federal Medical Center in North Carolina.
*  In a video shared with Democracy Now!, 70-year-old Bowers said he became a healer in prison and
*  hopes to continue his work on the outside.
*  I learned one thing during incarceration, that a man or a woman has to sooner or later
*  make a decision, make a choice as to how they intend to live life inside.
*  Long ago, I made a decision, I made a choice, to help my fellow men to heal and to find
*  peace in the chaos.
*  And that chaos will be raging all around, swirling.
*  And anyway, I was able to do that by utilizing the soothing and healing sounds of my beloved
*  shakuhachi.
*  That's the bamboo flute that I blow.
*  And meditation.
*  Baronza Bowers, former Black Panther, freed from prison after half a century behind bars.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  Coming up, in a sweeping move, the governor of Maryland's pardoned 175,000 marijuana
*  convictions ahead of Juneteenth.
*  Back in a minute.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Mm hmm.
*  An original composition by Verunza Bowers, Jr. played on his five-hole bamboo flute known
*  as a shakuhachi. The former Black Panther was released from prison in May after half a century.
*  He credits his music and meditation with becoming a healer while he was incarcerated.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman in New York,
*  joined by Democracy Now!'s Juan GonzÃ¡lez in Chicago. Hi, Juan.
*  Hi, Amy, and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around the world.
