Nearly two dozen congressmembers are backing legislation, the Block the Bombs Act, that would withhold offensive weapons from Israel that violate international law and humanitarian norms. "What Bibi Netanyahu wants is to continue to escalate this ground invasion and starvation of Palestinians, to absolutely take over Gaza and destroy Palestinian life," says Congressmember Delia Ramirez, one of the co-sponsors.

# Block the Bombs: Rep. Delia Ramirez Pushes Bill to Halt U.S. Weapons Sales to Israel over Gaza
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=3.2s)]
*  CNN's reporting, President Donald Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=4.2s)]
*  in a phone call this week and urged him to end the war in Gaza, among other topics. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  For more, we're joined by Democratic Congressmember Delia Ramirez of Chicago, who's introduced [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=12.76s)]
*  legislation called the Block the Bombs Act that would withhold the transfer of offensive [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=18.56s)]
*  weapons to Israel and demand Israel's compliance with U.S. and international law. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=24.42s)]
*  Congressmember Ramirez joins us now from Capitol Hill. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=29.08s)]
*  Can you lay out what's in the bill, Congressmember? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=32.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=35.64s)]
*  Amy, first of all, let me start by telling you that everything is connected. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=36.64s)]
*  You just heard that from Hallah. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=39.8s)]
*  It is so important to understand that in this precise moment, what Bibi Netanyahu wants [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=41.48s)]
*  is to continue to escalate this ground invasion and starvation of Palestinians to absolutely [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=47.08s)]
*  take over Gaza and destroy Palestinian life. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  That's what he wants to do. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=56.04s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to help him, and he wants to redevelop the land. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=57.56s)]
*  Block the Bombs Act bill is critical and urgent. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=60.72s)]
*  That's why we have 23 sponsors as we speak right now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=63.88s)]
*  It withholds a set of offensive weapons that you and I both know have been used repeatedly [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=67.16s)]
*  by Bibi Netanyahu with the authority of Donald Trump and previous administrations to be able [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=72.44s)]
*  to bomb children. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  So what this bill does is withholds a set of offensive weapons. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=82.22s)]
*  And it says that if Bibi Netanyahu, if the Israeli government wants to use any of these [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=86.0s)]
*  weapons, it would have to prove that it is not violating U.S. international and human [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=91.28s)]
*  rights law, which you and I both know is very difficult for a fascist like Bibi Netanyahu [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=97.64s)]
*  with his extremist friend, the duo, Donald Trump. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=101.88s)]
*  How much support do you have for cutting off offensive weapons support to Israel? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=106.92s)]
*  Amy, it's a bill, not a resolution. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=115.36000000000001s)]
*  I'm certainly a co-sponsor of the joint resolutions that we have seen of this approval. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=117.08000000000001s)]
*  But as of today, there are 23 members of Congress who have signed on to this bill, 22 original [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  co-sponsors, including three Jewish members as original co-leads and co-sponsors. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=129.8s)]
*  And we have a number of others from all over the country. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=135.52s)]
*  We are talking to people every single day. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=138.60000000000002s)]
*  There are people across the states that are calling and saying, Congress member, if you [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=140.98s)]
*  believe, if you are a pro-peace member of Congress, if you are tired of seeing the death [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=145.5s)]
*  toll and starvation of Palestinians, you must sign on to block the bomb spill. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=151.38s)]
*  And I believe that more will go ahead and add on to the support. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=156.6s)]
*  This is common sense, Amy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=160.54s)]
*  We can't keep watching this and go to sleep and act like we have no responsibility. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  Silence is complicity. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=168.1s)]
*  We will wake up years from now and ask ourselves, what the heck did we do in this moment? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=170.22s)]
*  Block the Bombs Act bill gives us an opportunity to finally assert our power as Congress. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=175.1s)]
*  Representative Delia Ramirez, we're going to ask you to stay with us, Democratic congressmember [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=180.45999999999998s)]
*  from Illinois, daughter of Guatemalan immigrants. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIkBsbJpUA&t=184.98s)]
