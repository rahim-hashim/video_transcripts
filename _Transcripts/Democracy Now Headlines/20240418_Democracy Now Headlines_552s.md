# Top U.S. & World Headlines — April 18, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHgIf3QxLOc)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israeli forces have killed at least 11 people, including five children, in strikes on the
*  southern city of Raffa.
*  Israel has repeatedly attacked the city ahead of an expected ground invasion.
*  There are new reports the Biden administration has approved Israel's plan to attack Raffa
*  in exchange for Israel not launching counter-strikes on Iran.
*  A 13-year-old Palestinian boy who survived an Israeli airstrike on his home in November
*  has now died after being hit in the head with a package that was being dropped from the
*  sky.
*  Zayn Orak died Sunday.
*  The airstrike in November had killed 14, 17 members of his extended family.
*  This is Zayn's grandfather, Ali Orak.
*  The first time when the house was hit by a strike, he came out from under the rubble
*  with wounds in his head, hand and leg.
*  God saved him.
*  Then, like the rest of the youth and children, because of hunger and frustration, he went
*  to get a meal, a can of fava beans, a kilogram of rice or flour.
*  The worst catastrophe is the one that makes you laugh.
*  They kill my family and send meals for those who are left.
*  And the one who followed the meal died as a child.
*  ProPublica has revealed a special State Department panel has urged the Biden administration to
*  disqualify multiple Israeli military and police units from receiving U.S. aid over serious
*  human rights abuses, including rape and torture.
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken received the recommendation in December but has not
*  taken any action.
*  Meanwhile, the U.N. refugee agency, UNRWA, has accused Israeli security forces of torturing
*  imprisoned U.N. workers in an effort to extract false confessions about the agency's ties
*  to Hamas.
*  The accusations are part of a new UNRWA report that documents how Palestinians detained in
*  Israel have been attacked by dogs deprived of food, forced into cages, beaten with metal
*  bars and tortured with nail guns and electric batons.
*  One Palestinian child released from Israeli prison had dog bite wounds on their body.
*  In Brussels, a speech by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was interrupted
*  when a member of the audience attempted to make a citizen's arrest.
*  Mrs. von der Leyen, this is a citizen's arrest.
*  You are charged with aiding genocide in Gaza.
*  You expressed total support for Israel at the beginning of this genocide.
*  The blood of Palestinian children is on your hands.
*  You are a criminal, Mrs. von der Leyen.
*  You should be in The Hague.
*  You should not be here.
*  You should not be running for a second term.
*  You are a war—you are a criminal.
*  Free Palestine!
*  Free Palestine!
*  The person speaking was David Cronin, an editor at the Electronic and Tefada News site.
*  He laid out his arguments again, Ursula von der Leyen, in a piece on the website, which
*  details ongoing efforts to support Israel, even as evidence of genocide and war crimes
*  pile up.
*  Google has fired 28 workers who protested its $1.2 billion contract with Israel.
*  Project Nimbus provides computing services to the Israeli military.
*  peaceful sit-ins this week by Google workers at their New York City and Sunnyvale, California
*  offices, which resulted in nine arrests.
*  Kate Sim, a child safety policy adviser and one of the terminated workers, said, quote,
*  listen when employers tell you exactly who they are.
*  McCarthyism is alive and well.
*  Look how terrified they are of worker power, they said.
*  Two of the Google workers who were fired, Mohammed Khatami and Ray Westrick, appeared
*  on Democracy Now!
*  Wednesday hours before their dismissal.
*  In more protest news, 29 authors and translators have withdrawn from consideration for PEN
*  America's prestigious literary prizes to protest the organization's leadership and
*  silencing of Palestinian voices.
*  In a letter, the authors wrote, quote, we refuse to be honored by an organization that
*  acts as a cultural front for American exceptionalism.
*  We refuse to gild the reputation of an organization that runs interference for an administration
*  aiding and abetting genocide with our tax dollars.
*  And we refuse to take part in celebrations that will serve to overshadow PEN's complicity
*  in normalizing genocide, they wrote.
*  On Capitol Hill, activists disrupted Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as he spoke at a House
*  Armed Services Committee hearing on Wednesday.
*  Among the protesters was Nasiba Hajaj, a Palestinian-American woman who's lost some
*  20 relatives in Gaza since October 7th.
*  She held up her 16-month-old son Hamza during the hearing.
*  My child is human!
*  Stop killing Palestinian children!
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson has released the text of three bills to provide $95 billion
*  to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan.
*  A vote could come on Saturday.
*  Johnson's speakership may also be on the line as two Republican lawmakers have backed
*  his ouster in part over his support for sending money to Ukraine.
*  In other news from Capitol Hill, the Democratic-controlled Senate has dismissed impeachment charges
*  against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
*  This ends a Republican effort to remove him from office.
*  Record rainfall soaked large parts of Oman and the United Arab Emirates this week, killing
*  at least 19 people in submerging major cities.
*  Some areas received a year's worth of rain in just a day.
*  Though heavy rains are expected this time of year, scientists say they're becoming
*  more intense and more deadly because of climate change.
*  Meanwhile, major flooding in Kenya has killed dozens of people and displaced thousands of
*  others.
*  French police forcibly evicted some 450 people, mostly migrants and asylum seekers, from France's
*  largest squat located in a Parisian suburb.
*  Housing and immigrant rights advocates say it's part of a plan to remove unhoused people
*  and refugees from Paris ahead of the Summer Olympics.
*  Buses were waiting to bring residents of the squat to other cities, even though many of
*  them have jobs in the Paris area and some families have children attending local schools.
*  And on Capitol Hill, two Boeing whistleblowers did not hold back as they described to a Senate
*  panel the chaotic manufacturing and dysfunctional safety culture at Boeing.
*  Sam Salipour, a quality engineer at Boeing, detailed the suppression and threats faced
*  by employees who try to warn Boeing about its planes.
*  I want to make clear that I have raised these issues over three years.
*  I was ignored.
*  I was told not to create delays.
*  I was told, frankly, to shut up.
*  At one point, Boeing management got sick of me and raising these issues and moved me
*  out of the 787 program into this 777 program.
*  But Salipour says the Boeing 777 program he was reassigned to also had serious issues.
*  I literally saw people jumping on the pieces of the airplane to get them to a line—I
*  call it the Tarzan effect, among other improper methods.
*  Again, I raised concerns internally.
*  I was sidelined.
*  I was told to shut up.
*  I received physical threats.
*  Ed Pearson, a former manager at Boeing, also told lawmakers both Boeing leadership and
*  federal regulators failed for years to heed internal warnings, even after the Lion Airlines
*  and Ethiopia Airlines crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed all 346 people on board.
*  This is Ed Pearson.
*  The world is shocked to learn about Boeing's current production quality issues.
*  I'm not surprised, because nothing changed after the two crashes.
*  There was no accountability.
*  Not a single person from Boeing went to jail.
*  Hundreds of people died, and there's been no justice.
*  Unless action is taken and leaders are held accountable, every person stepping aboard
*  a Boeing airplane is at risk.
*  Ed Pearson also called out the investigation into January's Alaska Airlines door blowout,
*  revealing Boeing deliberately withheld data related to work on the aircraft.
*  Pearson told lawmakers, quote,
*  I'm not going to sugarcoat this.
*  This is a criminal cover-up, he said.

*  And those are some of the headlines.
