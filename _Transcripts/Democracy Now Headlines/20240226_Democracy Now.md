# As 2-Month-Old Starves to Death in Gaza, Mosab Abu Toha Says His Own Family Is Eating Animal Feed
**Democracy Now!:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFYcH3iNS1k)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  We begin today's show with Israel's war on Gaza, where a famine is unfolding.
*  The United Nations said today the great majority of some 400,000 Gazans who are at risk of
*  starving are, quote, actually in famine, not just at risk of famine.
*  The UN World Food Program says the flow of aid in Gaza from Egypt and the distribution
*  of food that does get through has slowed in the past two weeks.
*  This comes as the Shahab News Agency reports a two-month-old Palestinian boy named Mahmoud
*  Fatou died from starvation Friday in northern Gaza, just days after the United Nations warned
*  of an explosion in child deaths due to the lack of food and water.
*  This is a displaced Palestinian mother sheltering at a school in the Jubalia camp in northern
*  Gaza.
*  My son is one year old.
*  He is asking for bread, for baby bottle milk.
*  He is going after me everywhere asking for a bottle.
*  What would I feed him?
*  There is no milk.
*  There is no bread.
*  There is nothing.
*  There is no food.
*  What will I feed him?
*  Meanwhile, in central Gaza, there are two young siblings from Gaza City who are now
*  living in a tent camp near Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital in Dar al-Bahla.
*  They describe being forced to eat animal feed.
*  When we were in Gaza City, we used to eat nothing.
*  We would eat every two days.
*  My mother, brother and aunts were martyred.
*  We were the only ones left, my father and my two brothers.
*  Due to hunger and poverty, we secretly came to Dar al-Bahla.
*  We did not tell our father.
*  After we came here, our grandmother called and started shouting at us.
*  We used to eat bird food.
*  It was bitter.
*  We did not want to eat it.
*  We used to do so forcibly.
*  We used to have a small loaf every two days.
*  We did not like it, as it was bitter.
*  We did not have clean water.
*  We used to drink salt water, and we got sick.
*  We did not have water to wash or clothes to wear.
*  Where could we have gotten those?
*  We came here.
*  The boys are 11 and 9 years old.
*  This comes as U.N. Chief Antonio Guterres warned Monday against a full-scale Israeli
*  military operation in Raqqa, where well over a million displaced Palestinians have sought
*  refuge, saying it would deliver, quote, the final nail in the coffin, unquote, for aid
*  programs in Gaza, where humanitarian assistance remains, quote, completely insufficient.
*  For more, we go to Cairo, Egypt, where we're joined by Mossab Abou Toha, a Palestinian
*  poet, teacher, author and founder of the Edward Said Library in Gaza.
*  His new piece for The New Yorker magazine is headlined My Family's Daily Struggle
*  to Find Food in Gaza.
*  In it, he writes about a message that his brother Hamza posted on social media earlier
*  which included a picture of what he was eating that day.
*  In his words, quote,
*  He translates his brother's Arabic caption, quote,
*  or even break it except by biting down hard with one's teeth.
*  Mossab Abou Toha, welcome back to Democracy Now!
*  If you can start by responding to what you heard, you got out of Gaza with your children
*  when you heard that a two-month-old boy starved to death on Friday in Gaza.
*  Well, in fact, this is very scary because most of the population in Gaza are children.
*  And all my cousins and most of my nephews and nieces are younger than 10.
*  So none of them would survive if they didn't have any good food or clean water for days.
*  Yesterday, I got a video from my brother Hamza.
*  Showing that my mother and my in-law were digging through the rubble looking for some food.
*  But all they could find were some books that were in my home.
*  So people are returning to their bond houses, which is not a safe place to search for food,
*  looking for some food that they used to have in their houses.
*  And the news about the death of some children is really scary.
*  Because, as I mentioned, most of the people in Gaza are children.
*  So, talk more about your brother's family and what he's facing right now and how you're
*  dealing with this, with your boys and your wife in Cairo.
*  Well, one striking thing is that my eight-year-old boy, whenever we sit to eat or whenever we
*  get a phone call or whenever we try to call our family in Gaza, the first thing my son asks is,
*  does my family in Gaza have food? Are they eating?
*  So he doesn't think about anything that has to do with the war itself.
*  He doesn't say that, are they in a safer place? Is there no bombing anymore? God willing.
*  No, he asks about food because he knows what it means to have little food when we were living
*  in Gaza before we left in December.
*  So every time he hears us talking to our family in Gaza, he would ask, does my grandfather have food?
*  Does my grandmother? Then he starts to mention his cousin's names.
*  Is Mustafa, is he eating? Is Nahida eating?
*  So he starts to mention them by name.
*  And for me, I feel really, really depressed whenever I go out in the street and find food.
*  So two days ago, I went and I bought two loaves of bread for about less than a dollar.
*  If I'm taking these two loaves of bread to Gaza right now, I would make a fortune.
*  I would sell them for about maybe $50. I'm serious.
*  This is very recent news.
*  One sack of bread, which weighs 25 kilograms, is sold for $1,500.
*  Because there is no wheat flour. This is yesterday.
*  And now I think the government in Gaza, although there is no government, but some people who worked
*  with the government are threatening people who are selling these things for very, very
*  staggering prices. Has your sister-in-law given birth yet?
*  Yes, she gave birth to a boy. His name is Ali. And now the boy is 10 days old.
*  And my brother could find something like a gift for his wife.
*  He could find a few pieces of beef and a few grains of rice for $100.
*  So this wouldn't even be enough for his wife, who gave birth just 10 days ago.
*  So although it's a very expensive thing, he could find these things after a week of search.
*  The last time UNRWA was able to deliver food aid to northern Gaza was January 23rd.
*  Since then, together with other UN agencies—this is a tweet from Philippe Lazzarini, the head of
*  UNRWA. He said, the last time we have warned against—it says, since then, together with
*  other UN agencies, we have warned against looming famine, appealed for regular humanitarian access,
*  stated that famine can be averted if more food convoys are allowed into northern Gaza on a
*  regular basis. Our calls to send food aid have been denied and have fallen on deaf ears.
*  This is a man-made disaster. The world committed to never let famine happen again.
*  Famine can still be avoided through genuine political will to grant access and protection
*  to meaningful assistance. The days to come will once again test our common humanity and values.
*  Again, a post on social media by Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, coming as the World
*  Food Program, has also paused its aid delivery to northern Gaza. And of course, UNRWA under siege,
*  the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long tried to get rid of the UN agency.
*  And now nearly 20 countries have defunded it, including the country that gave
*  UNRWA the most money, the United States. Mossad Abou Tocha, your response?
*  Well, I would like the whole world to listen to this. Now, Israel is not allowing food into
*  northern part of Gaza, so people would regret not having left it, as Israel was encouraging people
*  to, or ordering people to leave. And now people are thinking, okay, if we leave the northern part
*  of Gaza, would it be safe to be in the south? So because the first few days and few weeks,
*  Israel was telling people and ordering people, okay, you are safe now, you can take the Salah
*  Hadid Street or the sea street and go to the south because this would be a safe place for you.
*  And many, many people left, including me, and I was kidnapped on the way. But many people left,
*  and now they are crowded in Rafah in tents. I have one brother who's a bodybuilder and weightlifter.
*  He's a champion. He was a champion in Gaza. And he wrote me yesterday, he said, brother,
*  I haven't left my tent for a week. I'm depressed. I'm about to die. So he's in Rafah, and he's
*  depressed. And he thinks that he's going to die very soon. This is one thing. And the other thing,
*  how many food trucks have been halted from getting into Israel? How many weapons trucks,
*  how many weapons ship, arms shipment were halted from getting into Israel?
*  Why is it, why could Israel stop food trucks from getting into civilians? And when we know that most
*  of these civilians are children, while all the people in the world could not stop the
*  shipping of weapons, destructive weapons into Israel. I'm not talking here about stopping
*  food trucks from going into Israel, but I'm talking about here about weapons. I mean,
*  where is the mind of the people in the world? How could you allow this to happen?
*  You are funding Israel with more weapons and more food, of course, but you are not,
*  we are not asking people to allow weapon trucks into Gaza. I mean, we are not asking for this
*  because we don't want this to continue. What we are asking for is that people in Gaza have food
*  and have medicine, and we need to leave, to lift the siege on Gaza because this siege,
*  which is now intensified, did not start today. Gaza has been under siege since 2007. And now
*  we are in the bleakest stages of this siege. Gaza is not only now under siege, but it's under
*  genocide. So this is very scary, and I hope the world will not continue to watch and just show us
*  that they are helpless in the face of Israel. If you can't get food into Gaza, can you please stop
*  the shipping of weapons into Israel? Because they are killing us every day.
*  AMY GOODMAN I wanted to ask you about the
*  International Court of Justice, which has just concluded its six-day hearing on Israel's
*  occupation of the Palestinian territories. This is Ralph Wild, a representative of the League of Arab States.
*  RALPH WILD The occupation must end. Israel must renounce its claim to sovereignty over the
*  Palestinian territory. All settlers must be removed immediately. This is required to end
*  the illegality, to discharge the positive obligation to enable immediate Palestinian
*  self-administration, and because Israel lacks any legal entitlement to exercise authority.
*  Second, in the absence of the occupation ending, necessarily everything Israel does in the Palestinian territory
*  lacks a valid international legal basis, and is therefore, subject to the Namibia exception, invalid.
*  Not only those things violating the law regulating the conduct of the occupation.
*  Those norms entitle and require Israel to do certain things, but this doesn't alter the more
*  fundamental position from the law on the use of force and self-determination that Israel lacks any
*  valid authority to do anything. And whatever it does is illegal, even if compliant with, or pursuant to,
*  the conduct regulatory rules.
*  I will close by quoting Palestinian academic and poet Raffat Al-Ariya from his final poem
*  posted 36 days before he was killed by Israel in Gaza on the 6th of December 2023.
*  If I must die, you must live to tell my story.
*  That was Ralph Wilde, a representative of the League of Arab States, quoting the late Palestinian
*  poet Raffat Al-Ariya. Masaba Butoha, you were a close friend of Raffat. Can you respond to what
*  he said? Well, I'm still wondering how Israel could be still a member of the United Nations
*  when we know that it is occupying Palestinian lands. I mean, this is, I think, one condition
*  through which Israel joined the United Nations, I think, in the early 1950s was to stand by,
*  you know, the borders that were set after the partition plan. But now Israel occupies
*  more than 90 percent of the Palestinian land. I think what Raffat is asking is
*  how the world is, you know, is unable to control a state that they continue to fund. I mean,
*  they can't control it, but they continue to fund it. And they continue to cut the funds to the
*  United Nations organization that is trying to support the Palestinian people,
*  not during this genocide, but has been supporting people. And I was educated in their schools and I
*  went to their clinics and got medications for free. And now they are cutting their funding during the
*  most the most critical time of our lives in Gaza and also in other parts of the world. So this is
*  this is this really drives me insane because the world is pretending to be unable to do anything,
*  but they do the opposite. They continue to fund Israel. They send it weapons. They send it. They
*  send Israel more fruit and more vegetables and more wheat flour and more gas. But they say,
*  OK, we can't we can't stop Israel from killing its children. And I mean, I hope that someone
*  someone someone would come to explain this to me one time. And also one last point before I end
*  with my answer is that how many officials from the world came to Gaza to meet with the real people
*  there? If they are saying that Gaza is all Hamas, can you please come to Gaza and meet my mother,
*  my brother, my sibling Ali, who is now 10 days old? Can you come and meet them and listen to them?
*  What they what they are asking for? But but it was it was easy for them to come to go to Israel
*  and meet with them with the with the with the monsters there who are waging the war
*  and who are inciting to kill more and more people. But they never came to Gaza. I think
*  there is one reason for that, because Gaza does not have an airport. So it was easy for them
*  to fly and land in the land of Israel because they have an airport. But maybe one one reason
*  they couldn't come to Gaza is that Gaza does not have an airport. I mean, I could try to understand
*  Mazav Abu Toha, we want to thank you for being with us, Palestinian poet, author, teacher,
*  founder of the Edward Said Library in Gaza. We will link to your new piece in the New
*  Yorker magazine, headlined My Family's Daily Struggle to Find Food in Gaza. His award-winning
*  book is titled Things You May Find Hidden in My Ear, poems from Gaza.
*  you
