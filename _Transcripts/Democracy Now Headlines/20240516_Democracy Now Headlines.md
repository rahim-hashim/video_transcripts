*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The International Rescue Committee is warning the scale of the crisis in southern Gaza defies
*  imagination as Israel intensifies its attack on Raqqa, while key border crossings remain
*  shut down.
*  More than 600,000 Palestinians have fled Raqqa, despite having no safe place to go.
*  Another 100,000 have fled to the north.
*  Overnight, Israel deployed an additional commando brigade to Raqqa.
*  This is a Palestinian woman in Raqqa who's mourning after Israel killed her husband and
*  her son.
*  My son was beautiful as a moon.
*  He was a groom.
*  He went inside to his bride.
*  Thank God.
*  There's no safe place, not in Raqqa, not in Qayyum.
*  They slaughtered Jabalia.
*  They slaughtered Arno Seirat.
*  And they slaughtered Raqqa.
*  Safety is only with God.
*  May God have mercy on us.
*  On Wednesday, Israel shelled a clinic in Gaza City run by the UN aid agency UNRWA, killing
*  at least 10 displaced Palestinians, including children.
*  Earlier today, Israeli forces targeted residential buildings and an ambulance in Jabalia, killing
*  many Palestinians, including pregnant women.
*  Separately, five Israeli soldiers were killed Wednesday in Jabalia when they were shelled
*  by an Israeli tank.
*  Seven other Israeli troops were injured in what's being described as a friendly fire
*  incident.
*  This all comes as the University Network for Human Rights has concluded in a major report
*  The report was written in partnership with law school human rights clinics at Boston
*  University, Cornell, Yale and the University of Pretoria in South Africa.
*  In The Hague, the International Court of Justice is hearing arguments today from South Africa
*  in its genocide case against Israel, South Africa's requesting emergency measures over
*  Israel's escalating attack on Raqqa.
*  Israel's Defense Minister, Yoav Galant, has publicly challenged Israeli Prime Minister
*  Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel's future plans for Gaza.
*  Galant said he opposes Israeli military or civilian rule over the Gaza Strip.
*  We must dismantle Hamas' governing capabilities in Gaza.
*  The key to this goal is military action and the establishment of a governing alternative
*  in Gaza.
*  In the absence of such an alternative, only two negative options remain.
*  Hamas rule in Gaza or Israeli military rule in Gaza?
*  Galant's comments came a day after another member of Netanyahu's government, National
*  Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gavir, took part in a march calling for Israel to resettle
*  Gaza and expel Palestinians living there.
*  Another member of the Biden administration has resigned to protest the president's
*  policies on Gaza.
*  Lily Greenberg-Kahl has become the first known Jewish political appointee to resign over
*  the war.

*  In a resignation letter, she wrote, quote, I can no longer in good conscience continue
*  to represent this administration amidst President Biden's disastrous continued support for
*  Israel's genocide in Gaza.
*  She went on to write, quote, Biden is making Jews the face of the American war machine,
*  and that is so deeply wrong.
*  Greenberg-Kahl's views on Israel have shifted over the years.
*  In 2019, as a college student at the University of California, Berkeley, she served as president
*  of Bears for Israel, which is affiliated with AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs
*  Committee.
*  The acclaimed historian Ilan Pappé has revealed he was interrogated for two hours by federal
*  agents at an airport in Detroit after flying into the United States.
*  The agents questioned him about his Arab and Muslim friends in the United States, as well
*  as his views on Hamas, and if he thought Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.
*  Professor Pappé said he was allowed to enter the U.S. but only after agents copied the
*  contents of his phone.
*  Meanwhile in Europe, Germany's lifted a travel ban on the renowned British-Palestinian surgeon

*  that authorities later shut down.
*  Student-led protests across the United States are continuing.

*  the name of a slain Palestinian child, and refused to shake the hand of President Laura
*  Rosenberg.
*  Meanwhile, prominent Israeli journalist Amira Haas addressed Columbia Journalism School
*  graduates Wednesday.
*  AMIRA HAAS, IMAGINATION DIRECTOR, COLUMBIA JOURNALISM SCHOOL, JOURNALISM SCHOOL
*  The journalism that I chose to practice is based on the refusal to see injustice as normal,
*  the refusal to normalize it to a point that we do not see it.
*  This is exactly what the students here in Columbia and in so many other campuses in
*  and now in Europe have been doing.
*  Refuse to accept hell as normal.

*  it the Lema Center, in honor of Lema Jammous, a 9-year-old famous in Gaza for her journalistic
*  reports.

*  after he announced the school had agreed to an academic boycott of Israel following talks
*  with student protesters.
*  The chancellor of California State University has accused Lee of insubordination.
*  In Southern California, police raided an encampment at University of California Irvine, arresting
*  at least a dozen demonstrators.
*  This comes as UC student workers voted Wednesday to authorize a strike in response to the use
*  of force in dismantling the UCLA encampment earlier this month in violation of their labor
*  rights.
*  Meanwhile, the Harvard Graduate Students Union filed a federal complaint against Harvard
*  for surveillance and retaliation against their protest.

*  wolf attack.
*  Robert Fico is a populist leader who is an ally of Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban
*  and Russian President Putin.
*  Slovakia's President Zezana Kaputova said the shooting was an attack on democracy.
*  ZEZANA KAPUTOVA, Slovakia's President A physical attack on the prime minister is
*  primarily an attack on a person, but it is also an attack on democracy.
*  Any violence is unacceptable.
*  The hateful rhetoric we witness in society leads to hateful acts.
*  Please, let's stop it.
*  The Netherlands is set to see its most far-right government in decades after the populist leader
*  Geert Wilders announced his anti-immigrant party for freedom is forming a coalition with
*  three other parties six months after the victory in parliamentary elections.
*  But the Islamophobic Geert Wilders will not become the new prime minister after agreeing
*  to forfeit the leadership position as part of negotiations.
*  He is still expected to wield significant power over Dutch politics.
*  A crackdown on asylum seekers is widely expected.
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are meeting in Beijing
*  as Russia wages a new offensive in northeast Ukraine.
*  Last week, China put out a 12-point peace plan to end the war in Ukraine.
*  Earlier today, Xi said China, quote, hopes for the early return of Europe to peace and
*  stability, unquote.

*  as on nuclear and energy cooperation.

*  residents who've lived in New Caledonia for 10 years to vote in provincial elections.

*  We are angry.
*  Everything is taking place over there in France.
*  And us, we are wondering, are we being heard, the Kanak people?

*  rule since its colonization by France in the 19th century.
*  Many young people seek full independence from France.
*  In Argentina, LGBTQ and women's rights activists are accusing the government of far-right populist
*  Javier Millet of fomenting violence and hate after a man set fire to four lesbians, killing
*  three and seriously injuring the fourth.

*  with hate crimes and banned the use of gender-inclusive language in the military.
*  Human Rights Watch is hailing a monumental victory after a Swiss court convicted former
*  Gambian Interior Minister Usman Sanko for crimes against humanity committed under the
*  dictatorship of Yehya Jamit.

*  and unlawful killings between 2000 and 2016.

*  Commission on Presidential Debates, which has set up every presidential debate since
*  1988.
*  If the debates go ahead as planned, June's event would be the earliest ever presidential
*  debate and come before either candidate is officially nominated at their party's conventions.
