# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” August 14, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km1_79cukFw)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel's military has issued new evacuation orders for tens of thousands of Palestinians
*  sheltering in Chanyunas.
*  The latest mass displacement order came as the United Nations warned 84 percent of the
*  Gaza Strip is under evacuation orders issued by the Israeli army.
*  Earlier today, Israeli assaults across Gaza killed at least 20 Palestinians.
*  This comes as Haaretz is reporting the Israeli army has forced Palestinian civilians to inspect
*  potentially booby-trapped tunnels in Gaza.
*  The use of human shields is forbidden under the Geneva Conventions.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces killed four Palestinians in an airstrike on
*  the town of Tamun earlier today.
*  Soldiers were filmed seizing the corpses, part of an Israeli military practice of withholding
*  the bodies of Palestinians it kills.
*  A fifth Palestinian was killed during an early morning Israeli raid on the town of Tubas.
*  The UN's humanitarian agency has warned Israel's attack on a UN-run school in Gaza
*  City that killed at least 100 people Saturday was far from an isolated incident.
*  The UN reports it's at least the 21st Israeli strike on a school since early July that have
*  killed scores of civilians, including children.
*  On Tuesday, Algeria called an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss Israeli
*  attacks on civilians.
*  Riyad Mansour is Palestine's UN ambassador.
*  As the genocide continues, you have a responsibility to react, to save human lives and preserve
*  the foundations for peace and security for all, not just for some.
*  Israel is a rogue state with a rotten government due to the unbridled impunity it has enjoyed
*  so far.
*  The United States has approved $20 billion in additional weapons sales to Israel despite
*  federal laws that prohibit arms transfers to military units accused of gross human rights
*  violations.
*  The State Department's approval of the sales came just a day after Secretary of State Antony
*  commemorated the 75th anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Conventions with a call to respect
*  international humanitarian law.
*  Michigan Congressmember Rashida Tlaib, who's Palestinian-American, wrote in reply, quote,
*  You supported sending more U.S.-made bombs being used to commit war crimes.
*  The government of Israel bombed hospitals, schools and tents full of displaced Palestinians.
*  How can you say you are for respecting international human rights laws?
*  Tlaib asked.
*  Peace negotiations aimed at ending Sudan's 16-month war are expected to begin in Geneva
*  today, despite the Sudanese army's refusal to attend the talks mediated by the United
*  States.
*  Sudanese army officials said they would not show up accusing the rapid support forces
*  of violating an agreement between the warring parties brokered in Saudi Arabia last year
*  and also criticize the presence of the United Arab Emirates, which it accuses of backing
*  the RSF, as one of the observers in the Geneva negotiations.
*  This comes as the International Organization for Migration warns Sudan is at a breaking
*  point as famine has worsened an already catastrophic displacement crisis.
*  Massive floods across Sudan since June have also compounded the mass displacement.
*  The IOM has called on an urgent global response to the situation in Sudan and increased access
*  to humanitarian aid to prevent tens of thousands of more deaths in the coming months.
*  A second region of Russia has declared a state of emergency after Ukrainian forces pushed
*  deeper into Russian territory in a surprise offensive.
*  The governor of Russia's Belgorod region says Ukrainian drone and artillery attacks
*  have destroyed homes and killed civilians, adding to attacks in Russia's Kursk region
*  that began last week.
*  Almost 200,000 Russians have fled their homes.
*  Meanwhile, the government of Poland says it's been unable to execute an arrest warrant
*  issued by Germany for a suspect in the 2022 sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, which
*  were built to carry natural gas from Russia to Europe.
*  The pipelines were severely damaged in a series of underwater explosions in the Baltic Sea
*  that the United States initially blamed on Russia.
*  A 44-year-old Ukrainian diving professional identified as Volodymyr Z is alleged to have
*  attached explosive charges to the pipelines with two other Ukrainian nationals, Polish
*  authorities say the suspect fled to Ukraine in July.
*  Bangladeshi authorities have opened a murder investigation into the possible role of ousted
*  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the police killing of a grocery store owner during mass
*  student-led protests in July.
*  Hasina resigned earlier this month and fled to India.
*  The murder complaint is the first legal case filed against Hasina's deadly crackdown
*  on the weeks-long protests in which Bangladeshi armed forces killed at least 300 protesters,
*  including children, according to the U.M.
*  To see our coverage of Bangladesh, go to democracynow.org.
*  Thailand's Constitutional Court has removed the Prime Minister Shreertha Thavisen from
*  ruling he violated the Constitution by appointing a minister to his government who had a criminal
*  conviction and served six months in jail in 2008.
*  The move has plunged Thailand into new political turmoil and comes just days after the same
*  court dissolved the progressive move forward opposition party.
*  Thavisen's removal after less than a year in power means that Thai parliament must now
*  convene to form a new government.
*  a real estate tycoon is the fourth time Prime Minister in 16 years to be removed by the
*  Constitutional Court.
*  The Africa Centers for Disease Control has declared a public health emergency as a virulent
*  strain of M. pox spreads rapidly across Central Africa.
*  So far this year, the Africa CDC has logged over 15,000 suspected cases of the viral disease
*  formerly known as monkey pox, which can cause fever, rashes and extremely painful lesions.
*  It's most often spread through close intimate physical contact.
*  Scientists say the new strain of M. pox is more lethal with a fatality rate of around
*  five percent adults and double that in children.
*  Jean Kesea is director general of the Africa CDC.
*  In May, the Africa CDC said it was struggling to secure any of the millions of doses of
*  M. pox vaccine it requested from pharmaceutical companies, the World Health Organization's
*  meeting today to consider whether to declare a global public health emergency from M.
*  pox.
*  Here in the United States, at least 27 states are reporting very high levels of coronavirus
*  and wastewater samples, with a fourfold increase since June 1st, driving a summer surge of
*  COVID-19.
*  The United Auto Workers Union has filed federal labor charges against former President Trump
*  and billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk after the pair advocated for the illegal firing
*  of striking workers.
*  On Monday, Musk was heard laughing in agreement as Trump made these remarks during an audio
*  livestream on Musk's social media site, ex-formerly known as Twitter.
*  Well, you, you're the greatest cutter.
*  I mean, I look at what you do.
*  You walk in and you just say, you want to quit?
*  They go on strike.
*  I won't mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, that's
*  okay, you're all gone.
*  The UAW reiterated in a statement that under federal law, workers cannot be fired for going
*  on strike and threatening to do so as illegal under the National Labor Relations Act.
*  Meanwhile, the campaign reform group N Citizens United has filed a separate complaint with
*  the Federal Election Commission, arguing Musk's softball interview with Trump amounted to
*  an unlawful corporate contribution to Trump's presidential campaign.
*  We'll have more on Elon Musk's embrace of Donald Trump after headlines.
*  Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has made his first solo campaign appearance since he was
*  tapped as the Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee.
*  On Tuesday, Walz spoke to public sector union members at AFSCME's annual conference in
*  Los Angeles, drawing a stark contrast between a future Harris administration and one led
*  by Donald Trump and J.D. Vance.
*  The only thing those two guys knows about working people is how to work to take advantage
*  of them.
*  That's what they know about it.
*  Every single chance they've gotten, they've waged war on workers.
*  And their ability to collectively bargain, to take that away from them, all's we're
*  asking for is better wages, better benefits, better lives and dignity in the work that
*  we do.
*  Minnesota Congresswoman Manilhan Omar has fended off a primary election challenge after
*  pro-Israel groups raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to bankroll her opponent's campaign.
*  On Tuesday, Omar defeated former Minneapolis City Councilmember Don Samuel's capturing
*  more than 56 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary.
*  Omar has been a fierce critic of Israel's war on Gaza and for months has led calls for
*  a ceasefire.
*  Ahead of the primary, Congressmember Omar said in a statement, quote, It is shameful
*  that my opponent is actively courting Republican votes and desperately seeking funding from
*  AIPAC, unquote.
*  Omar's primary victory came after the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee and
*  its super PAC poured more than $25 million into defeating two black progressive Democrats
*  of the Squad, Congressmembers Cory Bush of Missouri and Jamal Bowman of New York.
*  Voters in Arizona and Missouri will decide in November the fate of two ballot measures
*  that would enshrine abortion access in their state constitutions.
*  Missouri's amendment would reverse the state's near total ban on abortions, which went into
*  effect after the Supreme Court's ruling that gutted Roe v. Wade in 2022.
*  Meanwhile, the Arizona measure would amend the state constitution to protect abortion
*  rights up to 24 weeks of pregnancy.
*  At least five other states, including Florida, Nevada and South Dakota, will vote on similar
*  measures this November.
*  A warning to our audience, our next story contains disturbing footage and accounts of
*  police violence.
*  In Ohio, a grand jury indicted a Franklin County police officer on murder and manslaughter
*  charges after he fatally shot a pregnant black mother in a Kroger parking lot over
*  a shoplifting accusation.
*  Body camera video of the killing last August shows Officer Connor Grubb pulled his gun
*  and fired a single shot through the windshield of a car being driven by 21-year-old Takaya
*  Young, who posed no threat to the officers.
*  Sean Walton is an attorney for Takaya Young's family.
*  The actions that led to the death of Takaya, the unnecessary aggression, the chilling community,
*  and the demands that amounted to comply or die were therefore all to witness and dreadful
*  clarity.
*  Takaya's life and that of her daughter were extinguished in an act of brutality, becoming
*  yet another symbol of the urgent need for reform in police conduct and accountability.
*  Authorities have opened an investigation into an online harassment lawsuit brought by the
*  Algerian Olympic boxing gold medalist Iman Khalif.
*  She was targeted by a torrent of misogynist, racist and sexist attacks over her gender
*  eligibility to participate in the 2024 Paris Olympics.
*  False claims and hate speech that Khalif was transgender or a man were posted online, including
*  by tech billionaire Elon Musk and author J.K.
*  Rowling, who are both named in Khalif's lawsuit.
*  Though not named in the complaint, Khalif's lawyer said Donald Trump could also potentially
*  be investigated over his social media remarks about the athlete.
*  Most of the attacks came from ex-formerly Twitter, which is owned by Elon Musk.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
