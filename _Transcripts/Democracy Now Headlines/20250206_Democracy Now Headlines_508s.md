As the Trump administration, led in part by his unelected adviser Elon Musk, sets its sights on cutting the Department of Education, we speak to longtime educator Jesse Hagopian about what he calls an "extremist, authoritarian power grab to dismantle public education and enforce ideological conformity." Hagopian, whose new book, _Teach Truth: The Struggle for Antiracist Education_, traces the history of racist educational censorship, adds, "This isn't about protecting children. We know that dismantling the Department of Education is really about imposing â€¦ the violence of organized forgetting."

*  Good morning. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  Hello, Amy and Nermeen. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=137.74s)]
*  Happy Black History Month and happy Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  Thanks for having me back on the show. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=144.62s)]
*  Trump's array of executive orders have been so blatantly unlawful that I would say he [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=148.14000000000001s)]
*  should enroll in a high school American government class to learn the basics of the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=155.46s)]
*  Constitution, except I don't know a teacher that would allow him in their classroom, given [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=159.98000000000002s)]
*  his record of boasting about sexual assault and his plan to abolish the Department of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=165.3s)]
*  Education isn't about local control, as he claims. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=171.66000000000003s)]
*  We know that because he's issued so many federal edicts about what kids are allowed to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=176.14000000000001s)]
*  learn. But let's call this what it is, an extremist authoritarian power grab to dismantle [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=182.58s)]
*  public education and enforce ideological conformity. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=189.46s)]
*  And we know that only Congress has the legal authority to to completely end the Department [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=194.22s)]
*  of Education, but he's already begun dismantling it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=200.94s)]
*  He doesn't have to fully abolish it in order to stop it from functioning. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=206.1s)]
*  Right. He can appoint a secretary who dismantles protections from the inside, like he's [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=213.02s)]
*  planning to do with Linda McMahon, and he can gut its funding and staff, as you pointed [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=218.22s)]
*  out already. He has ended the department's tracking of book bans, right, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=224.38s)]
*  effectively giving states a green light to erase history. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=231.94s)]
*  The American Library Association has documented over 4200 book titles that were banned [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=235.94s)]
*  in 2023 and over a thousand more last year. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=242.82s)]
*  Right. And so a staggering like 60 percent of these books are children's books featuring [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=247.73999999999998s)]
*  characters of color. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=254.06s)]
*  They've been banning books like the Ruby Bridges story, Miles, the Pulitzer Prize winning [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=256.06s)]
*  graphic novel about the Holocaust, books about Martin Luther King and the civil rights [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=261.65999999999997s)]
*  movement. And this isn't about protecting children. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=266.62s)]
*  We know that dismantling the Department of Education is really about imposing what [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=269.86s)]
*  Professor Henry Giroux has called the violence of organized forgetting, right, erasing [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=277.06s)]
*  history and replacing knowledge with state based propaganda. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=282.42s)]
*  And I'll just say if the order is successful, if he's able to either gut or completely [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=286.94s)]
*  abolish the Department of Education, it would end some 18 billion dollars in Title One [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=294.26s)]
*  funding, which provides crucial support to high poverty schools like many that I've [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=300.66s)]
*  taught in throughout the country. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=306.62s)]
*  I began teaching in Washington, D.C. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=308.74s)]
*  And I would pass the White House on my way to school in Anacostia in one of the most [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=312.26s)]
*  impoverished neighborhoods. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=318.3s)]
*  And my Title One school had a hole in the ceiling of my classroom and it would just [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=320.1s)]
*  rain in. It destroyed the rain, destroyed the first project I ever assigned as a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=324.94s)]
*  teacher before the kids could even present it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=331.54s)]
*  And that's why the schools desperately need this funding that he is getting ready to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=334.74s)]
*  gut as well as students with with with accommodations, IEP plans. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=341.78s)]
*  Special education funding is crucial. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=350.94s)]
*  Some 15 billion dollars from the Department of Education goes to that. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=353.46s)]
*  This is an education reform plan. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  This is really educational arson that he's proposed. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=362.74s)]
*  And explain, Jesse, who is his nominee, Linda McMahon? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=366.58000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it is breathtaking. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=371.46000000000004s)]
*  She fits the profile of so many of his appointees in that she is completely unqualified, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=374.42s)]
*  very little background in education. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=383.62s)]
*  She was a CEO for WWE Wrestling and like many of his nominees is also under investigation [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=386.90000000000003s)]
*  for allowing sexual assault to run rampant in in her organization. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=401.18s)]
*  She would be a disaster for the public schools in this country. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=409.38s)]
*  We need someone with a real vision for what the public schools can be and for keeping [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=414.97999999999996s)]
*  our children safe, not another privatizer. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=421.26s)]
*  Jesse Hagopian, we want to thank you for being with us. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=426.7s)]
*  We're going to do part two of this conversation and post it online at Democracy Now. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=429.38s)]
*  Or Jesse is a high school teacher in Seattle, Washington. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=433.94s)]
*  His new book is called Teach Truth, the Struggle for Anti-Racist Education. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=438.09999999999997s)]
*  And before we end this segment, do you think your book, Teach Truth, the Struggle for [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=445.06s)]
*  Anti-Racist Education, will be allowed to be taught in the public schools of the United States? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=450.14s)]
*  Well, with the rampant book banning, I'm worried about that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=456.46s)]
*  But I hope that educators take a look at it, because this is really a story about how [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=461.29999999999995s)]
*  they're trying to revive the worst of the McCarthy era, the Red Scare and the Lavender [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=467.46s)]
*  Scare, to attack teachers who teach the truth about U.S. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=472.58s)]
*  history, about black history, about indigenous history, about trans history and LGBTQ plus [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=476.7s)]
*  history. And we need these lessons desperately today to defend our students. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=484.06s)]
*  And we're going to talk about them in part two of this discussion. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=486.82s)]
*  Jesse Hagopian rhymes with utopian. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=490.17999999999995s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Nermeen Shaikh. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEDkDKwG0Yg&t=493.17999999999995s)]
