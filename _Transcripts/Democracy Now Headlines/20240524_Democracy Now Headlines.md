*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In central Gaza, generators at Al-Aqsa Hospital in Dera Balakh have reportedly gone out, as
*  the hospital warns there's no fuel left to power generators and without electricity,
*  quote, all patients will be condemned to death, unquote.
*  On Thursday, Al-Aqsa Hospital treated dozens of Palestinians injured in an Israeli shelling
*  on a welfare ministry site.
*  Twelve people were killed in that attack.
*  Most of the bodies were burnt.
*  More than 30 wounded arrived at this hospital.
*  This hospital in a few hours will not be functioning because of the lack of fuel for the generator.
*  Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital is the only one hospital that is functioning in central Gaza.
*  In the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, the last two hospitals still treating patients
*  remain under a days-long Israeli siege.
*  This comes as the Israeli military says the bodies of three hostages were recovered in
*  the refugee camp.
*  They're believed to have been killed in the October 7th attack then brought into Gaza.
*  In the south, Israeli ground forces continue at advance in Ra'afa, which has now been
*  decimated despite once being designated as a safe area.
*  The agency, when warns over 900,000 Gazans, nearly half the population, has been forcibly
*  displaced in the past few weeks and do not have access to shelter, food, water and other
*  essentials.
*  In diplomatic news, the Agence france-presse reports, CIA Chief William Burns is headed
*  to Paris in hopes of reviving ceasefire talks.
*  Meanwhile, the International Court of Justice is expected to rule shortly on South Africa's
*  request to order a halt to Israel's assault on Rafa.
*  A House panel held another hearing Thursday on student-Palestinian solidarity protests
*  with the heads of Northwestern University, Rutgers and the University of California,
*  Los Angeles.
*  While Republican lawmakers again sought to amplify alleged anti-Semitism on campuses,
*  Minnesota Congressmember Ilhan Omar questioned UCLA Chancellor Gene Block on failing to protect
*  his students when a violent pro-Israeli mob, many of them outsiders, attacked peaceful
*  protesters.
*  Because of your inaction, they acted on the intention and brutally attacked students you
*  were responsible for.
*  This happened in front of your eyes, on your campus, and it was live streamed for the whole
*  world to see.
*  So I would like to know if you are truly committed to keeping your students safe, how did you
*  fail these students at many critical points where you could have intervened?
*  Thank you for the question, but I really, I'm sorry, but I reject the premise.
*  These students, how do you reject the premise?
*  Are these pictures lying?
*  Are these pictures, are any of these people in jail?
*  The mob attacked the pro-Palestinian students at the encampment with metal bars and 2x4s.
*  We'll have more on this hearing after headlines with Northwestern professor Steve Thrasher.
*  As the hearing was unfolding in Capitol Hill, police and riot gear stormed UCLA's campus
*  just after hundreds of students set up another encampment and took over a campus building.
*  Meanwhile in Massachusetts, over a thousand Harvard graduates walked out of their commencement
*  ceremony Thursday.
*  Many chanted, let them walk, in reference to the 13 students not allowed to graduate
*  in retaliation for their involvement with campus protests.
*  Speakers at the ceremony also addressed the issue.
*  While these students may not leave with the degrees they rightfully earned, they will
*  walk out of Harvard's gates with something far more important, a clear conscience and
*  a proof of resolute commitment to humanity.
*  Take courage from their steadfastness and honor their sacrifice by using your degree
*  to speak out for the oppressed.
*  In international news, German police detained at least 130 people after raiding a peaceful
*  pro-Palestine occupation at Humboldt University in Berlin.
*  Students are calling on the university to, quote, take an active role in ending the genocide
*  against the people of Palestine and their decades-long suffering, unquote.
*  President Biden said he'll designate Kenya as a non-NATO ally.
*  As President William Ruto visited the White House Thursday, the largely symbolic title
*  was announced as Kenya prepares to deploy its forces to Haiti as part of an international
*  security mission.
*  The U.S. has pledged to contribute money, logistical support and equipment.
*  Biden justified the U.S. involvement in Haiti during a joint press conference with Kenyan
*  president Ruto.
*  Haiti is in an area of the Caribbean that is very volatile.
*  There's a lot going on in this hemisphere, and we're in a situation where we want to
*  do all we can without us looking like America once again is stepping over and deciding this
*  is what must be done.
*  Meanwhile, in Kenya, police are violently cracking down on environmental activists in
*  the village of Ayumbo as they protest the construction of a nuclear reactor.
*  At least three people were arrested on Tuesday.
*  Last night, President Biden held a state dinner for Kenyan president Ruto.
*  Among those who attended were two past presidents, Bill Clinton and President Obama, whose father
*  was Kenyan.
*  In Papua New Guinea, over 100 people are feared dead after a catastrophic landslide in the
*  northern Enga province.

*  The search for survivors continues.
*  The United Nations has approved a resolution declaring July 11 an International Day of
*  Remembrance for the 1995 Srebrenica genocide.
*  Some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed in a massacre after Bosnian Serb armed
*  forces stormed the U.N. safe zone during the Balkan Wars, seen as the worst atrocity in
*  Europe's history since World War II.
*  The resolution was sponsored by Germany and Rwanda.
*  Both Serbia and Bosnian Serbs have denied that genocide happened in Srebrenica.
*  The resolution does say Serbs are responsible for the massacre.
*  French President Emmanuel Macron described the recent upheaval in New Caledonia as a
*  quote, unprecedented insurrection movement, as he visited the archipelago on Thursday.
*  Macron said he would delay new reforms that would give voting rights to French residents
*  of the territory a move that the indigenous Kanak population argues will dilute their
*  voice and their struggle for independence.
*  This is French President Macron.
*  This reform, although it's rejected by some here, which has fed the violence, it has democratic
*  legitimacy.
*  The bill proposed by the government has been voted with a clear majority, both in the National
*  Assembly and the Senate.
*  I say this as president.
*  We don't just throw away popular sovereignty like a mere piece of paper.
*  Back in the United States, the Supreme Court Thursday approved a South Carolina congressional
*  map that a lower court previously ruled was racially gerrymandered and constituted a,
*  quote, bleaching of African-American voters from a district.
*  In a scathing dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote the decision will give state lawmakers,
*  quote, an incentive to use race as a proxy to achieve partisan ends, she said.
*  In abortion news, Louisiana's Republican-led legislature voted to classify abortion pills
*  as controlled substances.
*  Republican Governor Jeff Landry is expected to sign the measure into law, meaning the
*  possession of abortion pills without a prescription could soon be a crime in Louisiana, with penalties
*  including jail time and fines.
*  Methopristone and misoprostol have been deemed safe by the FDA and do not lead to abuse or
*  dependency, they have found.
*  The drugs are also used for purposes other than abortion, which is already widely banned
*  in Louisiana.
*  This is Tyler Barberin with the Louisiana Abortion Fund.
*  It's going to mean detrimental things and there are going to be very specific types
*  of people that are circumstanced into carrying pregnancies that they don't consent to or
*  did not want because of legislation like that, like this.
*  And that, unfortunately, will most likely be poor black communities that we represent
*  and that we do our work to support.
*  In related news, nearly 6,000 doctors have signed a letter urging the Supreme Court to
*  uphold the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act.
*  The federal law protects the rights of pregnant people to get the emergency medical care they
*  need.
*  The National Collegiate Athletic Association and the five most powerful athletic conferences
*  agreed to an historic $2.8 billion settlement, paving the way for college athletes to be
*  directly compensated for the first time ever.
*  The deal, which must still be approved by a judge, would provide back pay to athletes
*  as well as allow colleges to pay their players up to $20 million going forward.
*  Critics say the deal is flawed and risks creating gender-based pay inequalities and will disadvantage
*  smaller conferences.
*  The Justice Department, 29 states and District of Columbia sued Ticketmaster and its owner
*  Live Nation for exercising a monopoly over the live entertainment ticket prices and crushing
*  competition.
*  The lawsuit is calling for Live Nation, which controls around 80 percent of major concert
*  venues, to be broken up.
*  Norfolk Southern will pay the government a $15 million fine for last year's derailment
*  in East Palestine, Ohio, which caused a massive explosion and the release of toxic chemicals.
*  Norfolk Southern also agreed to spend $500 million to complete safety improvements and
*  address health concerns in the affected communities.
*  Last month, the company settled a $600 million class action settlement with East Palestine
*  residents.
*  EPA Administrator Michael Regan said the fine is the largest permitted under the Clean Water
*  residents blasted it as a slap on the wrist.
*  And Texas Congressmember Sheila Jackson Lee reintroduced the George Floyd Justice and
*  Policing Act Thursday, two days ahead of the fourth anniversary of the police murder of
*  George Floyd in Minneapolis.
*  Despite the national uprising that followed George Floyd's killing, Congress has failed
*  to pass the legislation named in Floyd's memory, which seeks to reduce racial profiling
*  and the use of force by law enforcement.
*  At least 1,247 people were killed by police last year, more than any previous year on
*  record.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
