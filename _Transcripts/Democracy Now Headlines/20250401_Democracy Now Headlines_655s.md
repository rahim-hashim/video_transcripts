The former international head of Doctors Without Borders is speaking out after New York University canceled her presentation, saying some of her slides could be viewed as "anti-governmental" and "antisemitic" because they mentioned the Trump administration's cuts to foreign aid and deaths of humanitarian workers in Israel's war on Gaza. Dr. Joanne Liu, a Canadian pediatric emergency medicine physician, was scheduled to speak at NYU, her alma mater, on March 19 and had been invited almost a year ago to discuss the challenges of humanitarian crises. Censoring speech is "killing the essence of what the university is about," says Liu. "I truly and strongly believe that universities are the temple of knowledge."

# "We Are Killing the Essence of What the University Is": Dr. Joanne Liu on NYU Canceling Her Talk
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=4.36s)]
*  We end today's show with a look at the alarming rise in censorship on university campuses [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=6.8s)]
*  across the United States. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Last month, New York University abruptly canceled a presentation by the former international [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=14.84s)]
*  head of Doctors Without Borders, Medicine Sans Frontières, because some of her slides [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=21.16s)]
*  could be viewed as, quote, anti-governmental. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=27.04s)]
*  Dr. Joanne Lu, a Canadian pediatric emergency medicine physician, a professor of clinical [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=30.16s)]
*  medicine at McGill University, and the former international president of Doctors Without [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=36.84s)]
*  Borders, was scheduled to speak at NYU, her alma mater, in March. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=42.24s)]
*  She had been invited over a year ago to discuss the challenges of humanitarian crises. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  But the night before her speech, NYU's vice chair of the Education Department called her [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=53.36s)]
*  to express concern over the content of some of her slides about casualties in Gaza and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  cuts at the U.S. Agency for International Development. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=66.08s)]
*  She offered to make edits, but three hours later, she was told her presentation was canceled. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=70.1s)]
*  In an op-ed in a French newspaper describing how elite universities are in the crosshairs [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=76.48s)]
*  of presidential cuts, Dr. Lu said she was astonished by the institution's posture [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=81.82s)]
*  of preemptive over obedience. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=88.74s)]
*  Dr. Joanne Lu joins us now from Canada. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  Welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=94.89999999999999s)]
*  Explain exactly what happened, Dr. Lu. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=97.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=99.46s)]
*  Yes, sure. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=101.46s)]
*  So as you said, I was invited several months ahead, and it's my alma mater. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=103.46s)]
*  It was the first time they were invited to me since I graduated in the 90s. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=108.38000000000001s)]
*  So you have to understand that for me, it was a moment of rejoice and happiness of being [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=112.06s)]
*  invited back. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  And so the title of the presentation was Challenges in Humanitarian Crisis. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=118.94000000000001s)]
*  And I was covering what had happened over the last year, because things have changed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=125.10000000000001s)]
*  This is a normal and regular lecture that I gave, but I always update it on a regular [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=130.02s)]
*  basis. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=137.42s)]
*  So basically, I went to New York, and then I submitted my presentation on the platform. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=138.61999999999998s)]
*  And then as soon as I arrived, because I was living at a friend's house, he just said, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=148.26s)]
*  by working in the ER at NYU, he said, by the way, the administration wants to talk to you. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=153.14s)]
*  And then I end up talking with the lady from the education, the vice chair. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=159.42s)]
*  And she said, well, listen, what do you have to say about your presentation? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=166.45999999999998s)]
*  I said, not much, but I think you have concern. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=169.94s)]
*  You want to share them with me? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=173.01999999999998s)]
*  And then she tells me that there was a slide that she thought that could be troubling the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=174.89999999999998s)]
*  audience, and it could be perceived anti-Semitic, because I was showing the number of casualties [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=182.01999999999998s)]
*  in conflict zones in aid workers. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=189.06s)]
*  And it is an extract from the aid workers' security database. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  And of course, there is a fair amount of casualties in Gaza, knowing what is happening right now, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=198.38s)]
*  but in other countries as well, like Sudan, like South Sudan, and Ukraine. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=204.34s)]
*  In addition to that, she said, well, we think that it could possibly be perceived as well [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=208.82s)]
*  as anti-governmental. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=216.34s)]
*  The way you talk about the US got the picture of Zelensky and Trump. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=220.02s)]
*  So I let her speak, and I said, OK. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=225.9s)]
*  I said, what do you want to do about that? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=227.9s)]
*  Do you want to offer me a suggestion where I could either change your presentation, nuances, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=229.78s)]
*  how I'm going to articulate things? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=236.18s)]
*  You know what? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=238.78s)]
*  I'm chill. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=239.78s)]
*  I'm really chill. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=240.78s)]
*  I'm flexible. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=241.78s)]
*  I want this to be a good moment. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=242.78s)]
*  And then she hesitated. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=244.74s)]
*  And then I said, OK. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=247.46s)]
*  And then a few minutes after, I said, let me offer those three slides I would remove. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=248.78s)]
*  As long as I can keep the key overarching message, I'm fine. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=253.54000000000002s)]
*  I can manage that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=258.42s)]
*  And she said, OK, listen, I'll get back to you in a few hours. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=259.42s)]
*  And basically, three hours later, I got a phone call. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=262.86s)]
*  And the lady was really, I always say that she was really sad. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  Anyway, I said, I sense some sadness. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=271.5s)]
*  I just said, listen, I'm very sorry. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=274.58s)]
*  We've been talking for the last three hours. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=278.14s)]
*  And I have to inform you that we have decided to cancel your conference. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=280.42s)]
*  And Dr. Lu, you were for six years the president of Doctors Without Borders, one of the most [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=286.74s)]
*  prestigious medical groups in the world. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=293.42s)]
*  Have you ever had a talk canceled before? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=297.86s)]
*  Actually, when a talk is canceled is because I'm canceling it, but not the other way around. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=300.38s)]
*  It did happen because for security circumstances or changes, I could not attend, but it happened [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=307.82s)]
*  really rarely. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  It was from my side. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=315.9s)]
*  And were you your reaction to when they told you it was canceled? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=319.3s)]
*  So my reaction was I was stunned. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=323.74s)]
*  I actually, it wasn't part of my scenario. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=327.86s)]
*  I'm someone who always planned for worst case scenario, but I could not imagine that that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=330.97999999999996s)]
*  case scenario because these are my friends. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=335.3s)]
*  And and and and it was a moment of of being united. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=338.06s)]
*  We haven't seen each other for a while. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=342.94s)]
*  And they send me regularly. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=344.53999999999996s)]
*  I would say even if I was in a meeting, I would say, I would say, I would say, I would [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=347.09999999999997s)]
*  say email to me how excited they were. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=353.06s)]
*  They told me some of our staff, I've seen your presentation a few years ago. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=355.54s)]
*  They said you brought tears to their eyes because the content is so is so moving. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=360.22s)]
*  We are so excited. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=365.74s)]
*  So I just thought that we would manage to find, I would say, a middle ground in all [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=367.38s)]
*  that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=372.42s)]
*  So, yes, it's complete stun and of course, disappointed. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=373.42s)]
*  So in your presentation, as you mentioned, you included a table from the aid worker security [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=377.26s)]
*  database that shows one of the places with the one of the places with the highest humanitarian [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=383.3s)]
*  casualties last year was the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=392.1s)]
*  Can you you were told you could be perceived as anti-Semitic if you talked about this and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=396.62s)]
*  also if you talked about USAID perceived as anti-governmental. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=402.18s)]
*  Respond to both Dr. Lu and what your international humanitarian work is all about. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=407.74s)]
*  Well with respect to that slide is was not it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=416.58s)]
*  It was not specifically, I would say, on Gaza. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=422.09999999999997s)]
*  It was the compilation of number of casualties in conflict zone in aid worker community. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=426.46s)]
*  And this is what I was trying to explain to the person because I just said, yes, this [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=435.7s)]
*  is the reason why we don't see casualty on the other side because it's about aid worker [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=441.9s)]
*  for the for the cut on USAID. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=447.58s)]
*  You just covered it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=451.38s)]
*  You know, when the disaster is happening in Myanmar, Myanmar in your show earlier, it's [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=452.38s)]
*  massive. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=456.34s)]
*  It's massive. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=457.34s)]
*  The generosity of US over the last years, if not decades, have been massive. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=458.34s)]
*  They were covering the overseas developmental aid, you know, up to 30 percent in terms of [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=465.46s)]
*  humanitarian aid. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=470.97999999999996s)]
*  Now, according to the numbers, it's something between 40 to 45 percent on a yearly basis. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=471.97999999999996s)]
*  So of course, when you do that abruptly, there's going to be consequences. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=477.96s)]
*  And so when you look at the figure, one of the things I was bringing forward is how it's [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=482.42s)]
*  going to impact the HIV AIDS program, where actually one of the most saving programs, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=487.26s)]
*  an American program, is PEPFAR, is the presidential program to fight HIV AIDS. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=497.7s)]
*  And people expect there's going to be several hundred of thousands of kids who might die [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=504.3s)]
*  in the hospital, and there's going to be a rise in terms of numbers because mother [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=510.02s)]
*  or HIV positive will not have access to antiretroviral medicine and will transmit the infection to [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=515.9399999999999s)]
*  their child during birth. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=522.98s)]
*  So it's massive, the impact. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=528.26s)]
*  And I was just talking because my presentation basically is on three pillars. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=532.02s)]
*  It talks about how to attract attention when a crisis happen, the security now in a conflict [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=537.74s)]
*  zone and the crisis time. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=544.94s)]
*  And then the third pillar was on funding. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=548.26s)]
*  We only have about 30 seconds left, but there was also news that USAID is moving to end [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=552.1s)]
*  funding for GAVI, the Global Vaccine Alliance that provides life saving vaccines for millions [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=556.5s)]
*  of poor children around the world. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=562.46s)]
*  Your response? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=564.82s)]
*  Yes, I think it's going to be a disaster, of course. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=565.9000000000001s)]
*  But I would like before we end the show, the reason why I wrote this letter is the fact [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=569.98s)]
*  that I truly and strongly believe that universities are the temple of knowledge, but as well of [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=574.5s)]
*  plurality of ideas. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=580.82s)]
*  And if we do not allow that, we are basically killing the essence of what university is [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=582.82s)]
*  about. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=588.74s)]
*  It's about having people to be able to express different point of view in a safety environment [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=589.98s)]
*  where as well the student can be exposed to it and make up their mind. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=596.3000000000001s)]
*  That is what is necessary and that is what makes a university, even a country, stronger [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=600.66s)]
*  by plurality of ideas. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=606.4200000000001s)]
*  We do have 20 seconds. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=608.98s)]
*  You are an alum of NYU. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=610.58s)]
*  In this 20 seconds, what do you think the students lost in not hearing your speech? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=613.22s)]
*  Well, I think they lost the fact of getting a sort of a different point of view of someone [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=620.14s)]
*  who has been, I would say, a failed aid worker. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=626.42s)]
*  So basically, I work from being on ground zero to the leadership role and I was given [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=631.9s)]
*  basically the whole spectrum of what it means doing aid work nowadays. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eITiHWtCdWE&t=637.9s)]
