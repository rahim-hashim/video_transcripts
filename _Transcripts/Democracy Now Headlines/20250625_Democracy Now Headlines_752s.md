History was made Tuesday night as democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani carried out a stunning upset and defeated Andrew Cuomo in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary. As the results became clear Tuesday night, Cuomo conceded and called Mamdani to congratulate him. The New York state assemblymember will now be the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City in November's general election. “Tonight we made history,” Mamdani told supporters. “In the words of Nelson Mandela, it always seems impossible until it is done. My friends, we have done it.”
Moe Mitchell, national director for the Working Families Party, says Mamdani’s campaign helped “create a multiracial working class alignment against authoritarianism [and] for a type of politics that is hopeful, that is visionary, that says we want something, we don't simply want to fight against something.”

# Zohran Mamdani Beats Cuomo in NY Mayoral Primary, Vows to "Fight for Working People with No Apology"
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM)
*  History unfolded here in New York City Tuesday night as Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=0.0s)]
*  carried out a stunning upset, defeating Andrew Cuomo in the New York City Democratic mayoral [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=5.98s)]
*  primary. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=11.64s)]
*  Mamdani, a 33-year-old New York state assembly member, was the first choice of over 43 percent [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=12.64s)]
*  of voters in the rank-choice election. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=19.6s)]
*  Outside funders shattered records as they spent more than $25 million to back former [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=23.04s)]
*  New York governor Andrew Cuomo's attempt at a political comeback four years after he [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=29.06s)]
*  resigned over sexual misconduct allegations by at least 11 women who were former staffers. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=35.78s)]
*  In contrast, Mamdani ran an energetic grassroots campaign focused on making the city affordable [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=42.18s)]
*  for working people and was endorsed by independent Senator Bernie Sanders and Congressmember [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=48.3s)]
*  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=53.78s)]
*  As the results became clear late last night, Cuomo conceded and called Mamdani to congratulate [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=56.18s)]
*  him. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=61.98s)]
*  In November, Zohran Mamdani will face off against the current mayor, Eric Adams, as [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=62.98s)]
*  well as a Republican candidate and possibly former governor Andrew Cuomo, who recently [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=67.3s)]
*  launched a new third-party line, though it's unclear he'll run. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=71.82s)]
*  If Mamdani wins in November, he will become New York City's first Muslim mayor and youngest [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=76.22s)]
*  mayor in over a century. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=81.34s)]
*  In his victory speech Tuesday night, Zohran Mamdani laid out why he won. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=83.5s)]
*  We have won because New Yorkers have stood up for a city they can afford. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=88.06s)]
*  A city where they can do more than just struggle. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=96.06s)]
*  One where those who toil in the night can enjoy the fruits of their labor in the day. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=100.18s)]
*  Where hard work is repaid with a stable life. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=109.14s)]
*  Where eight hours on the factory floor or behind the wheel of a cab is enough to pay [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=114.1s)]
*  the mortgage. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=119.06s)]
*  It is enough to keep the lights on. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=120.06s)]
*  It is enough to send your kid to school. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=124.58s)]
*  Where rent-stabilized apartments are actually stabilized. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=129.3s)]
*  Where buses are fast and free. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=135.66s)]
*  Where childcare doesn't cost more than CUNY. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=140.42s)]
*  And where public safety keeps us truly safe. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=145.42s)]
*  And it's where the mayor will use their power to reject Donald Trump's fascism. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=151.38s)]
*  To stop mass ICE agents from deporting our neighbors. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=162.62s)]
*  And to govern our city as a model for the Democratic Party. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=169.86s)]
*  A party where we fight for working people with no apology. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=178.34s)]
*  A life of dignity should not be reserved for a fortunate few. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=187.9s)]
*  It should be one that city government guarantees for each and every New Yorker. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=194.18s)]
*  If this campaign has demonstrated anything to the world, it is that our dreams can become [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=201.46s)]
*  reality. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=209.54000000000002s)]
*  Dreaming demands hope. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=213.9s)]
*  And when I think of hope, I think of the unprecedented coalition of New Yorkers that we have built. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=217.14s)]
*  For this, this is not my victory. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=225.78s)]
*  This is ours. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=230.06s)]
*  That's Democratic Socialist Zoran Mondani speaking at his victory party last night after [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=231.54s)]
*  he defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=237.94s)]
*  in what some are calling a political revolution. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=243.26s)]
*  He also thanked his parents, his mother, the film director Mira Nair, and his father, Columbia [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=246.94s)]
*  University professor Mahmood Mondani. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=252.9s)]
*  Special thanks to Laura Bastiyos for being there. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=256.21999999999997s)]
*  Mondani's victory was celebrated at multiple massive jubilant watch parties hosted by New [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=259.14s)]
*  York City chapter of Democratic Socialist America, which played a key role in organizing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=264.18s)]
*  his campaign. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=269.06s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Working Families Party endorsed four candidates in a strategy to beat Cuomo [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=270.3s)]
*  with Mondani as number one and said they would refuse to offer Cuomo the Working Families [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=276.46000000000004s)]
*  Party ballot line, even if he became the Democratic nominee. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=281.58s)]
*  That will not be an issue now. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=285.7s)]
*  For more, we're joined by Maurice Mitchell, the national director for the Working Families [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=287.94s)]
*  Party based here in New York. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=291.86s)]
*  We last spoke to you during our coverage of the DNC, the Democratic National Convention [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=293.7s)]
*  in Chicago. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=298.42s)]
*  Can you respond to Mondani's upset victory and the surge of grassroots support, especially [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=299.82s)]
*  young people, as he walked from one end of Manhattan to the other? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=306.54s)]
*  Well, Amy, Zoran's campaign is a bellwether. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=311.21999999999997s)]
*  This is one of the first major primaries of the year, and Zoran's surge is, to me, clear [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=317.18s)]
*  proof that people want leaders who will stand up for working people, and the contrast couldn't [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=322.42s)]
*  be more clear. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=328.98s)]
*  So you have Zoran who walked from one part, one from the northernmost part of Manhattan [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=329.98s)]
*  all the way down, right? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=336.98s)]
*  And you have Cuomo who basically, he ran a campaign where nobody could find him. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=339.38s)]
*  He was running away from his record. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=344.62s)]
*  He ran a campaign that was based on fear. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=347.18s)]
*  He ran a campaign that was emblematic of the status quo politics of the past. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=349.42s)]
*  You know, Cuomo's somebody who grew up in the governor's mansion and spent his career [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=354.14s)]
*  making deals to please his billionaire donors. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=358.14s)]
*  And Zoran built a grassroots campaign of everyday New Yorkers, a very broad and diverse set [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=361.46s)]
*  of folks. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  And when you look at where his campaign was able to win and where our coalition was able [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=368.78000000000003s)]
*  to win, it's every single part of New York. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=373.42s)]
*  This is a resounding victory for Zoran, for our movement, but for everyday working New [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=376.62s)]
*  Yorkers. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=383.86s)]
*  And really, this to me is a bellwether of more to come across the country. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=384.94s)]
*  This is an example of the type of politics that we think would help create a multiracial [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=390.42s)]
*  working class alignment against authoritarianism, but for a type of politics that is hopeful, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=398.18s)]
*  that is visionary, that says we want something. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=404.38s)]
*  We don't simply want to fight against something. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=406.62s)]
*  And I think this is an example of more to come. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=409.94s)]
*  Maurice, normally, whoever wins the Democratic primary for mayor is basically a shoe in to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=415.3s)]
*  be elected mayor. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=422.09999999999997s)]
*  But this year, things are somewhat different. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=423.26s)]
*  You have the incumbent mayor running as an independent. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=425.91999999999996s)]
*  Of course, you have a Republican, Curtis Sliwa of the Guardian Angels. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=430.2s)]
*  Looks like he is running on the Republican end. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=436.02s)]
*  You have Jim Walden, a major lawyer in the city running. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=439.34s)]
*  And of course, the possibility that Cuomo himself will run. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=447.09999999999997s)]
*  What do you see happening in terms of the Democratic establishment that opposed Mamdani? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=451.09999999999997s)]
*  Where will many of them go now? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=460.17999999999995s)]
*  Well, you know, last night, we saw within hours a resigned, defeated, and battled Governor [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=462.62s)]
*  Cuomo give a concession speech. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=471.26s)]
*  And to me, that's an example of a failed set of politics, a failed approach, a campaign [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=475.14000000000004s)]
*  that used every trick in the book, used all the tactics, and was backed by, you know, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=482.5s)]
*  $25 million of billionaire money from, you know, folks like Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=488.58s)]
*  right? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=494.73999999999995s)]
*  Some really, really bad people who are advancing authoritarianism, you know, Trump donors like [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=495.73999999999995s)]
*  Bill Ackman. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=503.14s)]
*  So what I saw was a complete collapse of that strategy. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=504.46s)]
*  And I think, you know, the Cuomo folks are probably rethinking any ideas that they might [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=509.26s)]
*  have. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=513.9s)]
*  But it's pretty obvious where the momentum is. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=515.02s)]
*  And I know in the general election, Zoran and his coalition is going to run a very rigorous [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=518.62s)]
*  general election that doesn't take anything for granted or any New Yorker for granted, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=523.0600000000001s)]
*  the same type of campaign that was run in the primary. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=528.82s)]
*  And I feel very, very, very confident that Zoran is not simply the Democratic nominee, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=533.26s)]
*  but is the presumptive mayor. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=540.1800000000001s)]
*  the momentum of this campaign and this movement. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=543.06s)]
*  This is one of the most exciting electoral movements of our era. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=547.06s)]
*  I think, Mo, that no one can deny that Zoran Mondani made quite a splash. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=551.62s)]
*  Your rep as the next mayor of New York City. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=561.62s)]
*  Let's plunge into the details. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=563.62s)]
*  So that was the video of Zoran Mondani jumping into the Atlantic Ocean in his suit, saying, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=565.86s)]
*  I'm freezing the rent. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=577.86s)]
*  I want to end with Zoran Mondani himself and another part of his speech. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=580.78s)]
*  Of course, we're going to talk about this over the next weeks as we lead into the November [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=585.3s)]
*  election. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=591.62s)]
*  This is Zoran Mondani in his victory speech last night. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=592.86s)]
*  In these dark times, I know that it is harder than ever to keep faith in our democracy. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=596.86s)]
*  It has been attacked by billionaires and their big spending, by elected officials who care [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=604.86s)]
*  more about self-enrichment than the public trust, and by authoritarian leaders who rule [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=611.1800000000001s)]
*  through fear. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=618.1800000000001s)]
*  But above all, our democracy has been attacked from within. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=621.54s)]
*  For too long, New Yorkers have strained to find a leader who represents us, who puts [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=627.54s)]
*  us first. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=634.22s)]
*  And we have been betrayed time and again. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=636.18s)]
*  After so many disappointments, the heart hardens. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WztCMFB8mlM&t=639.98s)]
