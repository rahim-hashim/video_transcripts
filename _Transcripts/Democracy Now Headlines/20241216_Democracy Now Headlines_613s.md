*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel is continuing to bomb Syria, a week after Syria's longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad
*  was ousted from power.
*  Last night, Israel dropped what's been described as an earthquake bomb on Syrian military and
*  air defense sites in the coastal Tartus region.
*  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights described Israel's bombing as the heaviest strikes
*  in the area in more than a decade.
*  According to the group, Israeli forces have launched over 800 strikes on Syria over the
*  past week.
*  The Israeli government has also approved a plan to expand illegal settlements in the
*  occupied Golan Heights.
*  This comes days after Israel invaded Syrian territory to seize more of the Golan Heights.
*  Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has confirmed the Biden administration's
*  been in direct contact with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.
*  The Islamist Syrian armed group that led the surprise offensive that toppled Assad will
*  have more on Syria after headlines.
*  Israel's unrelenting slaughter of Palestinians in Zengaza continues.
*  Early this morning, a strike on the Nusadat camp killed Palestinian grandfather Khaled
*  whose story was shared with millions around the world last November after Israel murdered
*  his grandchildren, including three-year-old Reem, whom Nabhan was filmed cradling while
*  repeating the words, the soul of my soul.
*  Separately, Israel bombed yet another U.N.-run school without warning, killing at least 20
*  people in the Khajini shelter.
*  At least 60 Palestinians have been killed over the past day of attacks, bringing the
*  official death toll to more than 45,000 Palestinians, though the true toll is certainly much higher.
*  At least three journalists have been killed in weekend attacks, including Al Jazeera
*  cameraman Ahmed Alou, as well as Mohammed Balusha, who last November was the first to
*  report about the intensive care babies who died after Israeli soldiers forcibly evacuated
*  the Al-Nasr hospital.
*  This is a clip from that reporting for Al-Mashad.
*  This is the scene in the ICU of Al-Nasr Children's Hospital that was under siege by the Israeli
*  army.
*  They didn't allow these babies to evacuate and prevented anyone from rescuing them from
*  the hospital.
*  Until now, these bodies are still there alongside other bodies of citizens laying in the streets
*  while no party is able to pick them up and bury them with dignity.
*  Khamal's unlawful targeting of Gaza's hospitals continues more than a year later.
*  In the north, Khamal Adwan Hospital remains under siege and attacked by Israeli forces.
*  Israel last week also ordered an area which includes the Patients' Friends Benevolent
*  Society Hospital to evacuate.
*  The hospital has the only neonatal intensive care unit in north Gaza to receive premature
*  babies.
*  Israeli forces have also destroyed the Abu Shabak Health Center in Jabalia.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Palestinian Authority police forces have continued raids in the
*  Jenin refugee camp, killing a senior leader of the resistance group Jenin Brigades Saturday.
*  The killing of Yazid Jaisa came amidst an escalating crackdown by Palestinian Authority
*  forces across the West Bank, targeting groups resisting Israel's occupation.
*  Gunshots and explosions were heard across Jenin.
*  Many residents have taken to the streets in protest of the raids.
*  UNRWA, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, has suspended its services
*  in Jenin due to the violence.
*  Israeli soldiers have also continued near-daily attacks in the West Bank, including in Hebron,
*  where Israeli forces shot and killed a disabled 23-year-old man during a raid Friday.
*  Mohammed Ahmed Masalma, who had learning difficulties, was shot as Israeli soldiers
*  arrested his cousin inside a paint shop.
*  In the Republic of Georgia, protests continue in the capital Tbilisi, as demonstrators
*  gathered outside Parliament over the weekend after the ruling Georgian Dream Party appointed
*  far-right former soccer player Mikhail Kavalashvili as president.
*  But Georgia's president, Salameh Zarabishvili, who backs joining the European Union, has
*  said she won't step down until new parliamentary elections are held following allegations of
*  fraud against the governing Georgian Dream Party, which claimed victory in October.
*  Zarabishvili's term ends today.
*  Kavalashvili was the only candidate on the presidential ballot and easily won the bid
*  as Georgian Dream controls the 300-seat electoral body that replaced direct presidential elections
*  in 2017.
*  On the Acre Pelago of Myot, hundreds if not thousands of people are feared dead after
*  the islands were devastated by tropical cyclone Cito, the worst cyclone to hit the French
*  territory in at least 90 years.
*  Residents have described the widespread destruction as apocalyptic as the storm flattened entire
*  neighborhoods, destroyed hospitals and schools and knocked out electrical grids, leaving
*  Myot in the dark for over 36 hours.
*  The authorities warn residents have already started to die of thirst and hunger while
*  emergency workers are scrambling to search for survivors.
*  Myot is one of the poorest French territories, with many residents living in makeshift settlements.
*  The cyclone made landfall Sunday in Mozambique, where at least three people were killed.
*  In Sudan, at least nine people were killed Friday after a drone strike on the main hospital
*  in North Thorfora's Al-Fasher city.
*  At least 20 others were injured in the attack, which Sudanese authorities blamed on paramilitary
*  rapid-support forces.
*  South Korea's parliament impeached President Yun Suk-yul over his attempt to declare martial
*  The final vote, 204 to 85.
*  Yun's presidential powers have been suspended.
*  His future now rests in the hands of South Korea's Constitutional Court, which will
*  decide whether Yun should be removed from office.
*  The court will hold its first public hearing on December 27.
*  Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung called for Yun to be removed from office as soon as possible.
*  We are restraining, however, rather than celebrating the victory ourselves and being
*  scattered.
*  Shouldn't we continue to fight together to ensure that there is a swift and serious
*  accountability to be held and ensure the removal of Yun Suk-yul as soon as possible?
*  South Korea's Prime Minister Han Deok-su will serve as interim leader until the court
*  issues its ruling on Yun.
*  Meanwhile, the head of Yun's ruling People Power Party, Han Dong-hun, has resigned days
*  after voting to impeach Yun.
*  We'll go to South Korea later in the broadcast.
*  Here in the United States, President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance
*  attended the Army-Navy football game Saturday, along with some of Trump's Cabinet picks,
*  including in battle Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's nominee
*  to become director of national intelligence, and Cash Patel, Trump's pick to head the
*  FBI.
*  Vance also invited Daniel Penny to the game, the former U.S. Marine who was acquitted last
*  a New York jury of killing the street performer Jordan Neely on a subway train, putting him
*  in a chokehold.
*  In other transition news, three prominent tech billionaires, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos,
*  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altman of OpenAI, have reportedly agreed to their
*  companies donating $1 million each to Trump's inaugural fund.
*  Zuckerberg, who once banned Trump from Facebook, recently dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.
*  ABC News, which is owned by Disney, has agreed to donate $15 million to Trump's presidential
*  library to settle a defamation lawsuit filed by the president-elect.
*  Trump sued the network after ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos said Trump was found liable
*  for rape in a 2023 civil case in Manhattan, broke by writer E. Jean Carroll.
*  ABC has been widely criticized for agreeing to settle instead of going to court to fight
*  what many believe to be a winnable case.
*  The Democratic election's attorney, Mark Elias, responded to the settlement by writing,
*  "'Knee bent, ring kissed, another legacy news outlet chooses obedience.'"
*  The New York Times is reporting Trump and his allies are threatening to file more defamation
*  lawsuits in an attempt to crack down on unfavorable media coverage.
*  President Biden has come under fierce condemnation, as the names of the 1,500 people he granted
*  clemency to last Thursday were revealed.
*  They include former Pennsylvania Judge Michael Cunahan, who was sentenced in 2011 to 17 and
*  a half years for accepting nearly $3 million in kickbacks for sending 2,300 children, some
*  as young as eight years old, to for-profit prisons on false charges.
*  Another person receiving clemency is Mira Satchdiva, a Mississippi doctor who gave her
*  patients diluted chemo drugs as part of a massive Medicare fraud.
*  Rita Crundwell, a former Comptroller and Treasurer in Illinois, embezzled more than
*  $53 million from the city of Dixon.
*  She used the money to breed racing horses.
*  Biden's act of mass clemency came in the wake of his presidential pardon for his son
*  Hunter.
*  And those are some of the headlines.

*  It's great to be back temporarily in my hometown of New York.
