*  This comes as campaign reform advocates have called out both the Democrats and the Republicans
*  for failing to disclose the source of some of their largest contributions using a practice
*  known as bundling.
*  Bundlers collect large sums of money, but candidates are not required to disclose their
*  information.

*  a guardrail for good government and to see both sides eroding that guardrail is concerning,
*  they said.
*  And the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals will review the case of Crystal Mason.
*  A black mother who was sentenced to five years in prison for attempting to cast a provisional
*  ballot in the 2016 election when she was ineligible to vote.
*  At the time, Mason was on supervised release for a tax felony and was unaware that this
*  barred her from casting a ballot.
*  Her ballot was never actually counted.
*  Mason's conviction was already overturned and she was acquitted earlier this year, but
*  Tarrant County's conservative district attorney appealed the decision.
*  Crystal Mason appeared on Democracy Now! in 2018.
*  Crystal, do you ever plan to vote again?
*  I do.

*  I just feel right now that the system failed me.
*  You get out, you rehabilitate yourself, you get a good job, you go to school, you graduate
*  from school, you're doing everything right.
*  So, why would I go and vote to go back to prison?
*  Yeah, but I mean, she could sit.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
