We go to Madison, Wisconsin, to speak with The Nation's John Nichols about Tuesday's pivotal state Supreme Court election, in which liberal Judge Susan Crawford convincingly defeated conservative candidate Brad Schimel. Crawford's election is a major victory for Democrats after billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk poured about $25 million into the Wisconsin race, helping to make it the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history. "This is a huge signal from a battleground state that Americans are genuinely upset, genuinely angry, I think, with Trump and with Musk," says Nichols. Tuesday also saw a pair of special House elections in Florida where Republicans held both seats, helping to maintain the party's narrow majority in Congress. While Democrats were unlikely to flip the deep-red districts, Nichols notes "there was a huge shift in both of the Florida districts toward the Democratic candidates."

# Elon Musk Fails In Attempt to Buy Wisconsin Supreme Court as Judge Susan Crawford Beats Brad Schimel
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y)
*  We begin today's show in Wisconsin, where liberal judge Susan Crawford defeated the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump-backed Brad Schimel for a seat on Wisconsin's state Supreme Court in the most expensive [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=6.48s)]
*  judicial election in U.S. history. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=12.52s)]
*  Many view the race as a referendum on Elon Musk, the world's richest man and Trump [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=15.68s)]
*  megadoner, who's been heading the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle key [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=19.84s)]
*  federal agencies. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=24.62s)]
*  Judge Crawford won 55 percent of the vote, even though Musk spent over $25 million on [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=26.72s)]
*  the race to help elect Schimel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=33.68s)]
*  On Sunday night, Musk gave out $1 million checks to two Wisconsin voters, one of whom [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=36.66s)]
*  happened to be the chair of the Wisconsin Federation of Young Republicans. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=42.2s)]
*  Judge Crawford made a reference to Musk during her viscerary speech. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=47.44s)]
*  As a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I'd be taking [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=51.96s)]
*  on the richest man in the world [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=58.04s)]
*  for justice in Wisconsin. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=60.28s)]
*  And we won! [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=73.64s)]
*  When Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price, our courts [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=77.16s)]
*  are not for sale. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=84.52s)]
*  While Democrats are celebrating the results in Wisconsin, as expected, Republicans won [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=88.56s)]
*  two closely-watched House races in conservative districts in Florida, but the races were much [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=93.96s)]
*  closer than in November. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=99.36s)]
*  Joining us from Madison, Wisconsin, is John Nichols, the nation's national affairs correspondent. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=101.92s)]
*  His new article headlined Wisconsin Rejects Musk's Money, Trump's Lies and the Right-Wing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=106.64s)]
*  Assault on the Judiciary. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=112.6s)]
*  John, overall, I think it's being estimated that there was something like $100 million [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=114.8s)]
*  spent on the state judicial race. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=122.08s)]
*  Can you talk about the significance of the liberal judge Crawford's victory by quite [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=125.08s)]
*  a large margin? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=131.96s)]
*  It was quite a large margin, Amy, and let me tell you, I don't think we can overestimate [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=135.44s)]
*  the significance. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=141.68s)]
*  Going into this race, when people would ask me about it, I would say there's no middle [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=143.44s)]
*  ground. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  If Crawford wins, it will be a huge signal that Americans are rejecting, obviously, the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  money that Elon Musk is using to try and buy elections, but also they're rejecting the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=156.84s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=163.06s)]
*  On the other hand, if Brad Schimel had won, it would have been taken by Trump and Musk [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=165.14000000000001s)]
*  as a total vindication for what they're doing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=170.58s)]
*  The reason that was so is because Wisconsin is an absolute battleground state. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=174.18s)]
*  It's incredibly closely divided. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=179.22000000000003s)]
*  In the last seven elections, five—for President of the United States, five have been decided [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=181.18s)]
*  by under 30,000 votes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=187.02s)]
*  So this is a state where things are usually very, very close, but it wasn't that way [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=189.34s)]
*  on Tuesday. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  Susan Crawford did win by the better part of 200,000 votes. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=195.0s)]
*  She did win that 55-45 victory. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=200.54s)]
*  And what's perhaps most significant is she won communities and regions of the state that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=203.92s)]
*  had voted for Trump just five months ago in a very, very high turnout election. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=209.68s)]
*  So, as I suggest, I just don't think you can overestimate the significance. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=215.28s)]
*  This is a huge signal from a battleground state that Americans are genuinely upset, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=219.56s)]
*  genuinely angry, I think, with Trump and with Musk. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  And, John, that wasn't the only race in Wisconsin. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=230.72s)]
*  There was also an election for state superintendent of public instruction. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=234.36s)]
*  What happened there? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=238.12s)]
*  Well, you're sure—you're exactly right, Juan. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  The race for superintendent of public instruction, which is the state's top education job, and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=242.76s)]
*  is a very significant job. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=250.64s)]
*  It's the post that current governor Tony Evers held before he became governor, was [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=252.36s)]
*  intensely fought. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=259.84s)]
*  It was a battle between the incumbent, Jill Underly, who has been an absolute supporter [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=261.28s)]
*  of public education. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=266.44s)]
*  She's a former rural educator, versus a woman named Brittany Kinzer, who was supported [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=267.6s)]
*  by the Republicans and who was supported by advocates for voucher programs that would [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=273.12s)]
*  take money out of public education. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=279.0s)]
*  Very clear choice. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=282.0s)]
*  Kinzer had a lot of resources. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=283.32s)]
*  She was backed by a lot of the same campaigners that were out there for Brad Schimel in the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=285.32s)]
*  Supreme Court race. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=289.92s)]
*  And Jill Underly won—it wasn't quite as big a victory as the Supreme Court race, but [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=291.48s)]
*  it was roughly a 53-47 victory, a very clear, solid win. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=296.76s)]
*  So in both statewide races, in the battleground state of Wisconsin, the progressive—the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=302.44s)]
*  clearly progressive candidates won. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=308.2s)]
*  And John, could you comment on the results in the two congressional special elections [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=312.32s)]
*  in Florida? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=318.32s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=319.32s)]
*  Those are important elections, because, you know, special elections in the first weeks [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=320.32s)]
*  of a new president's term will often give us an indication of, you know, kind of where [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  sentiment is going. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=330.92s)]
*  Now, these were heavily gerrymandered districts. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=332.24s)]
*  They were designed to elect Republicans. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=334.8s)]
*  There was no question of that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=338.2s)]
*  And the prospect that a Democrat would actually win one of these seats was, you know, pretty [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  hopeful on the part of any Democrat who thought that would happen. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  However, there was a huge shift in both of the Florida districts toward the Democratic [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=348.72s)]
*  candidates, both of whom, by the way, were not, you know, famous people per se or, you [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=354.6s)]
*  know, particularly powerful figures, and they were running against very prominent officials [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=359.52s)]
*  in Florida on the Republican side. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=364.88s)]
*  And yet what we saw is that counties in rural and more urban Florida that had actually been, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=366.88s)]
*  you know, pretty supportive of Trump, in some cases shifted toward the Democrats. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=375.68s)]
*  And overall, it was a result that I think Democrats can point to and do a sophisticated [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  analysis. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=388.48s)]
*  Essentially, what they need to say is this. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=389.48s)]
*  Look, these weren't districts that we were going to win, but these are districts where [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  you could get a measure of where the sentiment is moving in the United States. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=397.44000000000005s)]
*  And that's what I would say. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=403.76000000000005s)]
*  Remember, we have a lot of congressional districts across the U.S. that Republicans hold, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=405.68s)]
*  but that are much, much more closely divided. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=410.88s)]
*  It would be an easier run for the Democrat. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  So if you see this kind of shift in districts across the country in 2026, there's simply [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=417.20000000000005s)]
*  no question that the Democrats would take the House of Representatives. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=423.6s)]
*  So, again, those were two special elections in Florida for the seats of the embattled [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=426.56s)]
*  national security adviser Mike Walz and for Gates, who was named attorney general, nominated [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=432.48s)]
*  by Trump, but then ultimately had to pull out and pull out of Congress around various [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=438.48s)]
*  drug and sex scandals. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=442.64000000000004s)]
*  But I wanted to go back to Wisconsin for one minute and ask not only the significance for [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=444.0s)]
*  the country—I mean, if you take what Elon Musk said, he said it's for the future of [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=450.56s)]
*  Western civilization—but his candidate was defeated. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=457.20000000000005s)]
*  What this means, for example, in particular about abortion rights, as the Democrats keep [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=461.12s)]
*  the majority on the Wisconsin state Supreme Court, John? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=467.44s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=472.24s)]
*  In Wisconsin, it was a very, very clear choice. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=472.72s)]
*  Susan Crawford has been a very strong supporter of abortion rights for a long time. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=475.6s)]
*  She, in addition to being in the past a lawyer for labor unions, she was a lawyer in cases [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=482.16s)]
*  brought by Planned Parenthood. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=489.04s)]
*  And so there was no question of where she stood on the issue, and she put it front and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=490.88s)]
*  center in her campaign. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=494.32s)]
*  On the other hand, Brad Schimel is a longtime Republican politician who had been very closely [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=495.92s)]
*  associated with the anti-choice position and, in fact, was backed by ardent advocates of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=502.08000000000004s)]
*  a ban on abortion rights. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=508.56s)]
*  And so the choice couldn't have been clearer. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=510.56s)]
*  And I think that there are always people who like to tell you that abortion is fading as [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=512.8000000000001s)]
*  an issue, that as time passes, perhaps it's not as resonant. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=517.76s)]
*  But when I was talking to voters yesterday, I was struck by the very strong turnout of [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=522.08s)]
*  young voters. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=527.28s)]
*  I was at a polling place on the University of Wisconsin campus shortly before the polls [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  closed, and there were literally young women running in to cast their vote, trying to make [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=532.64s)]
*  it in time, you know, before the closing of the polls. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=537.6s)]
*  And in talking to these folks, you found a number of them were putting the issue of abortion [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=540.48s)]
*  rights very high on their list. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=546.48s)]
*  So I think it continues to be a very resonant issue. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=548.4s)]
*  And to ask you about all this money that Elon Musk is pouring into these political campaigns. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=551.76s)]
*  I mean, talk about taking Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision, putting it on [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=560.08s)]
*  steroids. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=565.04s)]
*  Your sense of the legality of all of this, of offering a million dollars to particular [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=566.24s)]
*  voters? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=575.0400000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=577.0400000000001s)]
*  This, Musk's spending and the way he did his spending has been incredibly controversial [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=577.84s)]
*  in Wisconsin. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=582.4000000000001s)]
*  The attorney general did bring an action against him. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=583.52s)]
*  Other legal groups have been raising this issue. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=586.72s)]
*  It didn't get litigated before the election. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=590.24s)]
*  But I don't think there's any question that there's going to be a continuing examination [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=595.2800000000001s)]
*  of how Musk spent his money and of real questions of whether there were violations of Wisconsin [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=600.1600000000001s)]
*  election law. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=607.44s)]
*  But there's something deeper as regards to all this one. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=608.4000000000001s)]
*  Even if it was legal, what we need to understand is that we had a situation in Wisconsin where [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=611.76s)]
*  the wealthiest man in the world tried to buy an election. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=619.12s)]
*  He poured his money in as roughly $25 million in addition to all these other gimmicks, all [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=623.6s)]
*  these other stunts. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=631.52s)]
*  And I think that a lot of political analysts would have told you, well, that's going to [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=632.88s)]
*  win because money wins in politics. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=637.84s)]
*  But that didn't happen in Wisconsin. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  So when we talk about the significance of this, beyond the legalities, there's a political [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=643.1999999999999s)]
*  significance. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=647.76s)]
*  The message out of Wisconsin is that Musk's money doesn't win. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=648.72s)]
*  And that message matters for Democrats, obviously, going into the 2025 fall elections as well [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=654.64s)]
*  as the 2026 midterm elections. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=662.08s)]
*  It also matters for Republicans in Congress because there's no question Elon Musk has [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  tried to intimidate them by threatening to use his money to punish any Republican that [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=670.1600000000001s)]
*  stands up to Donald Trump's agenda. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=675.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, now those Republicans have a counter-narrative, another piece of information, which says that [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=677.28s)]
*  yeah, maybe Musk's money could protect you in a primary, but it might not be enough to [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  protect you in a general election. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=687.8399999999999s)]
*  And so, we've got a very significant signal out of Wisconsin about money in politics in [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=690.24s)]
*  general and about Elon Musk's money in particular. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=695.12s)]
*  I mean, it is remarkable that one of Elon Musk's $1 million recipients went to the [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=698.64s)]
*  chairman of the Wisconsin College Republicans, a person who had worked for Ron Johnson to [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=704.0s)]
*  get him elected and in the fall of 2024 worked for Turning Point Action, Charlie Kirk's group. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=712.3199999999999s)]
*  But I want to turn to Texas for one minute as we wrap up. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=721.36s)]
*  In an interview with The New York Times, Democratic House Minority Leader Keane Jeffries [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=725.1999999999999s)]
*  accused Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott of slow-walking a special election to replace [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=729.36s)]
*  Congressmember Sylvester Turner in Houston, who died last month. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=735.04s)]
*  This is really significant. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=741.04s)]
*  I mean, it looks like Abbott is not going to call a special election, at least at this point, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=742.8000000000001s)]
*  but will keep it open, this seat, which would most likely go to a Democrat representing [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=747.84s)]
*  Houston, of course, until the November 2026 election. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=753.28s)]
*  We just have 30 seconds. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=758.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=760.0799999999999s)]
*  I've written about these issues a lot in the past. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=761.4399999999999s)]
*  Governor's playing with special election dates. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=764.0799999999999s)]
*  It is an absolute assault on democracy. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=766.7199999999999s)]
*  We need to understand that congressional seats, House seats, are filled in elections. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=769.92s)]
*  They aren't appointed. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=774.8s)]
*  And so when you have a governor of one party saying, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=776.0s)]
*  we're not going to let people elect a successor to a member who has passed away, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=779.12s)]
*  that governor is saying that I'm going to leave you, the people of a major American city, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=784.32s)]
*  unrepresented for the better part of a year and a half. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=789.6s)]
*  It is absolutely unacceptable, and Texans should be raising an outcry about what [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=793.52s)]
*  Governor Abbott appears to be doing. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=800.24s)]
*  John Nichols, we thank you for being with us. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=802.5600000000001s)]
*  The nation's national affairs correspondent will link to your various articles at democracynow.org. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=804.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSxwqzz6M6Y&t=814.24s)]
