Mass demonstrations are continuing in Turkey, where Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu has been arrested on corruption charges. Since protests broke out last week, Turkish authorities have detained more than 1,400 people, including students and journalists. İmamoğlu is the main rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the 2028 presidential election and was recently nominated for president by the Republican People’s Party. Erdoğan has led the country since 2003, but his popularity has dropped in recent years amid increasingly authoritarian policies cracking down on dissent. “Everyone knows that this is politically motivated and that Erdoğan is scared that he’s not going to win against Ekrem İmamoğlu,” says Turkish political scientist Ezgi Başaran.

# 1,400+ Arrested in Turkey as Erdoğan Jails Istanbul Mayor & Intensifies Authoritarian Crackdown
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  We end today's show in Turkey, where protesters took to the streets for a seventh consecutive [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  night, defying a ban following the jailing of the Istanbul mayor, Ekrem Imamlu, who's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=10.08s)]
*  seen as the biggest political rival to Turkey's authoritarian President Recep Tayyip Erdogan [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=16.04s)]
*  ahead of the 2028 presidential election. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=20.64s)]
*  Since protests broke out, Turkish authorities have detained more than 1,400 people, including [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=23.44s)]
*  students and journalists. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=28.0s)]
*  Democracy Now! spoke to Turkish political scientist Ezgi Basidan, an associate faculty [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=30.44s)]
*  member at Oxford University. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=35.2s)]
*  I began by asking her about the Istanbul mayor's significance, the arrest in Turkish politics [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  since being elected mayor. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=42.76s)]
*  Ekrem Imamlu won the election. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  He became the mayor of Istanbul in a landmark victory in 2019 and took Istanbul from the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=49.44s)]
*  grips of the ruling party, first time ever. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=57.8s)]
*  As you might remember, Erdogan's rise to power started with the Istanbul mayorship, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  and he once said that one who rules Istanbul rules Turkey. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=69.36s)]
*  So Istanbul has always—I mean, his most precious gift, and losing Istanbul to Ekrem [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=74.8s)]
*  Imamlu in 2019 made him extremely angry. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=84.64s)]
*  That's why the first election was annulled by charges of irregularities. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=88.56s)]
*  But it angered many people, so a rerun happened, and then Ekrem Imamlu won with a bigger margin. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=95.76s)]
*  But a relentless protracted, you know, legal warfare happened. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=103.76s)]
*  He's been accused by calling the Supreme Electoral Council fools, the council that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=112.88s)]
*  annulled the first vote. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=120.88s)]
*  So he actually—the court sentenced him to over two years, which would lead into a political [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=124.08s)]
*  ban, but it's pending appeal. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=135.52s)]
*  And then several terror charges have been thrown at him since 2021. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=137.44s)]
*  And this year—I mean, the last year, autumn, 2024 autumn, things have escalated. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=143.84s)]
*  Pro-government talking heads started saying that Ekrem Imamlu is corrupt to its core, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=149.92s)]
*  and there is going to be this really patriotic, heroic prosecutor who is going to take him [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  down and make him pay. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=163.84s)]
*  And suddenly people around Ekrem Imamlu—this is happening like two weeks ago—campaign [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=167.52s)]
*  staff, contractors, media consultants, suddenly they were slapped with travel bans. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=173.28s)]
*  And then came the absurdity. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=179.76s)]
*  Last week, beginning of last week, Ekrem Imamlu's 35-year-old university diploma was cancelled [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=182.4s)]
*  on bureaucratic grounds, which would disqualify him to run against Erdogan in a presidential [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=190.24s)]
*  campaign because— [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=197.6s)]
*  Because you have to be a college graduate to run for president? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=198.6s)]
*  Exactly, exactly, which is ironic. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=202.64s)]
*  And I think this is kind of a—now in the playbook of the authoritarians, there's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=205.68s)]
*  gaslighting, because there is also an enigma about Erdogan himself, Erdogan's own diploma. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=212.16s)]
*  We have never seen his diploma, and many people think that he only has a two-year [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=222.88s)]
*  in-between diploma, not a university diploma. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  He's accused of Ekrem Imamlu not having a diploma. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=236.32s)]
*  Two days later, he's arrested. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=242.08s)]
*  A 121-page interrogation report was published, leaked, whatever you say. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  I read it, and the questions—I mean, the allegations are based on three anonymous [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=252.16s)]
*  witnesses, no concrete evidence, no chief prosecutor showing any financial crime [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=259.76s)]
*  documents or anything, just rumors through these witnesses. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  Now Ekrem Imamlu is both accused of running an organized crime, being a leader of an organized [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  crime that—you know, a financial crime, and also a simultaneous investigation is also underway, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=288.48s)]
*  that he's also supporting the outlawed Kurdish militant group, PKK. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=296.24s)]
*  So let me go to that issue. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=304.16s)]
*  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has accused the opposition CHP party of fueling terrorism, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=306.8s)]
*  referring to the massive protests that have erupted since the arrest and detention of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=313.76s)]
*  the Istanbul mayor last week. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=318.56s)]
*  This is the president. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=320.64s)]
*  TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish President [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=322.08s)]
*  The opposition, the Republican People's Party, attempted to provoke our nation over this [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=323.0s)]
*  corruption operation. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=329.0s)]
*  They have been doing everything they can for four days to disturb the peace of the nation [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=331.08000000000004s)]
*  and polarize our people, from insulting anyone they encounter to attacking our police officers [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=335.64000000000004s)]
*  who are only doing their jobs, from intimidating our members of the judiciary who are investigating [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=341.32000000000005s)]
*  corruption reports to suppressing the national will with street terrorism. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  They have done it all. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=351.16s)]
*  Your response to this, Esgi Basidan, to the president of Turkey? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=353.16s)]
*  ESGI BASIDAN, Turkish President [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=358.44s)]
*  I really don't want to be in that position to respond to him, but I will try. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=359.88s)]
*  I mean, it is terrifying to be a person with integrity and intellect in Turkey, because, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=365.24s)]
*  look, we're seeing the arbitrariness, the breakdown of seriousness in the judicial system. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=375.88s)]
*  We are seeing a system where hearsay is enough to arrest a politician who won re-election [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=384.2s)]
*  just a year ago with 4.5 million votes, 51 percent of Istanbul's electorate. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=391.32s)]
*  And if that happens to Ekrem İmamoğlu, what could happen to anyone else who voiced [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=398.6s)]
*  dissent or challenged the status quo? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=405.24s)]
*  But same thing, this is terrifying, yes, but also the fear of a... [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=409.48s)]
*  The wall of fear that we say in Turkey has cracked, that kept people in. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=416.44s)]
*  And students, octogenarians, they all fled to the streets to ask for... [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=423.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, to protest what has happened, because everyone knows that this is politically [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=432.6s)]
*  motivated and that Erdogan is scared that he's not going to win against Ekrem İmamoğlu. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=440.76000000000005s)]
*  So, the political motives are just very conspicuous. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=447.8s)]
*  But people are on the street, the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=454.44000000000005s)]
*  mottoes are really sweet, the youth are just finding all kinds of ways of presenting their [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=462.04s)]
*  contentions, but the Turkish government is what is called a high capacity undemocratic state in [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=472.36s)]
*  political science parlance, which means strong under oppression, weak on rights. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=481.56s)]
*  So, they are doing what they know best, water cannons, tear gas, plastic bullets. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=486.84s)]
*  And like you said at the beginning, a thousand are being detained. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=495.4s)]
*  And we just learned just now that more than 250 are arrested. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=501.64s)]
*  And he's not going to back down, Erdogan, because that would be detrimental to his rule. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=508.44s)]
*  I mean, he's just going to ramp up its repression of the streets and this legal warfare that would... [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=516.04s)]
*  What we hear would encompass more students, journalists, politicians, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=526.04s)]
*  businessmen, academics and artists, actually, in the coming weeks. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=535.88s)]
*  And can you talk about the detention of journalists, the arrests? And we've [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=543.0s)]
*  talked about 1,100 people arrested so far. Also, 10 journalists at least detained, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=546.68s)]
*  both in Istanbul and Izmir. One of the journalists detained covering the protest [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=552.76s)]
*  outside Istanbul's City Hall, nine others detained in dawn raids. And what this means [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=557.56s)]
*  for press freedom in Turkey? Amy, there's no press freedom in Turkey. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=563.4s)]
*  I mean, whatever left of several news outlets who are trying very hard to financially [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=568.92s)]
*  survive is also becoming moot, in a way. Because, I mean, news is costly and you can end up in jail, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=579.16s)]
*  but also you can't really survive, do your work or do your reporting. And my colleagues are [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=591.88s)]
*  still trying to do their best, but every day there's something, a terrorism charge, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=599.72s)]
*  or insulting the nationals, I mean, a public official, or jeopardizing national security, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=605.8s)]
*  are those charges that throw my colleagues, who end up in jail, at least lose their job or lose [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=615.0s)]
*  their license to operate as journalists. Those 11 journalists were just doing their jobs. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=623.56s)]
*  But at the peak of the protest, while we were waiting the decision of the courts, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=630.84s)]
*  all of a sudden the board of broadcasting in Turkey just all of a sudden tweeted that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=638.68s)]
*  if they continue to go live from the field, from, you know, just, you know, if you continue the, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=651.2399999999999s)]
*  anyone continuing the live stream of the protest will lose their license. And just like that, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=658.8399999999999s)]
*  we lost the live stream from, you know, Saracane or Taksim from Istanbul. So this is how, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=664.76s)]
*  this is the environment that Turkish media is operating. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=671.64s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN The talk about voices being shut out, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=675.48s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about the richest man in the world, about Elon Musk and his social media [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=678.52s)]
*  platform X, which has reportedly suspended hundreds of accounts belonging to opposition [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=684.12s)]
*  activists and others in Turkey. Can you talk about the significance of this? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=690.92s)]
*  YULIYA GERMELINI I mean, like I said, the gaslighting part is [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=695.8s)]
*  just tremendous. They're actually seriously playing with our nerves at some point. I mean, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=703.24s)]
*  we know that—I mean, Elon Musk is detested among liberals and pro-democracy people in Turkey [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=710.92s)]
*  because of his sleazy meetings with Erdogan, and, you know—and it's covert or overt [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=720.68s)]
*  negotiations in terms of, you know, giving names or providing data of certain individuals that [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=731.16s)]
*  Turkish intelligence or Turkish—any Turkish state official asked for. So, but nobody's surprised how, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=739.2399999999999s)]
*  you know, Elon Musk operated, because they are in such a good relationship. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6wk4oI4wTY&t=749.24s)]
