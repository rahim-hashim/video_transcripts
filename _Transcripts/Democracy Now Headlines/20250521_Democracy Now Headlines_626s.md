Cuts by the Trump administration are beginning to “chase” U.S.-based scientists at federal agencies and research institutions out of the country. “We’re draining our scientific talent,” says environmental journalist Robert Hunziker, who explains how China and European countries are offering positions for scientists laid off, fired or pushed out by Trump and DOGE’s mass culling of federal workers and funding. The massive U.S. “brain drain” is a “brain gain” for other countries, adds Hunziker, and comes as the Trump administration also cracks down on university curriculums and targets international students for its mass deportation initiative.

# Trump’s Brain Drain: Scientists Look to Move Abroad as DOGE Slashes Research Funding in U.S.
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM)

*  as scientists look to take their research overseas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  For more, we're joined by Robert Hunsiker, environmental journalist whose new piece for [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=27.44s)]
*  Dissident Voice has headlined America's Great Brain Drain. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=31.68s)]
*  Explain exactly what this is, Robert. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=35.7s)]
*  Thanks for being with us. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=38.36s)]
*  Robert Hunsiker, Environmental Journalist, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=39.36s)]
*  Well, it's just what it says it is. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=40.36s)]
*  That's—the Trump administration is chasing our scientists out of the country, across [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=43.36s)]
*  whether it's in the entire apparatus of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=50.3s)]
*  or if it's in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, it doesn't matter. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=58.22s)]
*  They're firing people. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=63.66s)]
*  They're moving them to lesser positions or moving them from, say, Baltimore to a remote [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=64.7s)]
*  location in Idaho so that they won't appreciate their job any longer. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=69.86s)]
*  And we're having a massive drain of, really, the smartest, brightest people that we need [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=74.9s)]
*  to confront health problems in this country. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=81.34s)]
*  And they're going in Europe. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=86.06s)]
*  And you're going— [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=87.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=88.06s)]
*  Robert, in your article, you mentioned that at the same time that the federal government [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=89.06s)]
*  is cutting funding for science, the European Union, Canada, Australia are increasing the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=93.7s)]
*  amount of money that they're devoting to scientific research to actually lure American [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=100.62s)]
*  scientists to those countries. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=106.42s)]
*  Can you talk about that as well? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=109.62s)]
*  President Ursula von der Leyen of the EU has dedicated another half a billion dollars to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=112.22s)]
*  agencies to bring specifically U.S. scientists, educators, and academics to the EU. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=123.34s)]
*  President Macron of France has done the same thing, specifically to bring U.S. scientists [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=133.54s)]
*  to France. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=139.46s)]
*  And now Germany's doing it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=140.46s)]
*  And now Spain has jumped on the bandwagon. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=142.02s)]
*  And now China is doing the same thing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=145.46s)]
*  And they're saying, for any Chinese-born or Chinese-American scientist, we're opening [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=148.14s)]
*  up an avenue for you, and we're going to provide grants and pay for you to come. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=153.33999999999997s)]
*  So we're draining our scientific talent, and it's on the way out. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=158.94s)]
*  You know, Nature, which is the leading journal for science in this country, did just a random [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=163.45999999999998s)]
*  poll of 1,600 respondents. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  And 75 percent of them said, we're looking to go overseas now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=172.26s)]
*  So we're draining one of the most valuable assets we've got in the country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=176.74s)]
*  And what's the long-term impact of this brain drain? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=183.62s)]
*  What will it be for the United States? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=187.84s)]
*  Well, it's going to be very, very serious when it comes to the healthcare area. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=189.62s)]
*  If you look, for example, at the—but let me give you an example of a massive misallocation [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=196.34s)]
*  of resources. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=205.3s)]
*  And I think this is a point I really want to make. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=206.54s)]
*  If you look at the HHS, which is the Health and Human Services Department, run by Kennedy, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=209.42s)]
*  $1.8 trillion budget, within that you've got Medicare and Medicaid, those kind of things. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=215.98s)]
*  And there's some other agencies as well that are crucial to the health of this country. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=220.89999999999998s)]
*  For example, the FDA, the Center for Disease Control, and the NIH, National Institutes [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=225.22s)]
*  of Health. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=232.73999999999998s)]
*  Those agencies essentially are the Department of Defense for the interior of this country. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=234.14s)]
*  They really are. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=238.85999999999999s)]
*  They prevent epidemics or stop them once they come. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=239.89999999999998s)]
*  They are the Department of Defense for the interior of the country, much as the Pentagon [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=243.82s)]
*  is the Department of Defense to protect enemies from a raid in our country. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=249.01999999999998s)]
*  Well, we haven't had an invasion since Pearl Harbor. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  They're getting $850 billion for the Pentagon, and they want to add $100 billion, Trump does, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=257.34s)]
*  to that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=264.94s)]
*  Meanwhile, let's go over and look on the interior side of defense. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=265.94s)]
*  And what's happened here is you had 103 million people that were infected five years ago with [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=270.34s)]
*  COVID, and 1.2 million of those people died. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=279.73999999999995s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=282.78s)]
*  There's a miracle that happened, a miracle that happened. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=284.26s)]
*  And that's this. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=287.02s)]
*  The NIH, and their budget's being cut 40 percent by Trump, by the way, the NIH brought a vaccine [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=288.26s)]
*  within one year. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=295.53999999999996s)]
*  That had never happened before. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=296.74s)]
*  The fastest vaccine that had ever been brought to this country previously was in the 1960s [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=298.62s)]
*  for months, and it took four years. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=304.09999999999997s)]
*  So you want to cut the agency that saved literally millions of lives by bringing this vaccine [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=306.78s)]
*  within a record time of one year. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=312.65999999999997s)]
*  You want to cut them by 40 percent. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=315.1s)]
*  And you're thinking about maybe adding another $100 billion to an $850 billion budget, where [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=317.46s)]
*  we haven't had one enemy attack to this country since Pearl Harbor. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=322.98s)]
*  I think that, you know, this is like going down the rabbit hole and having lunch with [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=328.3s)]
*  a Mad Hatter. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=333.22s)]
*  That's how insane this has become. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=334.22s)]
*  Let me ask you, Robert. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=337.18s)]
*  The Trump administration charged the highly skilled Harvard scientist Xenia Petrova with [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=338.18s)]
*  criminal felony smuggling charges for failing to declare frog samples when she returned [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=344.14000000000004s)]
*  to the U.S. in February, usually seen as a minor infraction. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=350.22s)]
*  She has been detained in an ICE jail in Louisiana and says she faces political persecution if [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=353.70000000000005s)]
*  deported to Russia over a protest against the invasion of Ukraine. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=359.82000000000005s)]
*  Her work could lead to major advances in early cancer detection. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=364.20000000000005s)]
*  If you can talk about what message is being sent by Xenia's detention, the message to [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=370.38s)]
*  scientists, the students that are being detained around the country, the message to international [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=377.90000000000003s)]
*  students coming here, that they might not only be deported, but imprisoned. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's a pretty horrible message, isn't it? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=388.74s)]
*  I mean, that's the only way to look at it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=393.02s)]
*  And it's really—I guess you've just got to say we're at the point where this [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=394.94s)]
*  is kind of the epitome of fascism. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=399.02s)]
*  You know, you look at Huxley's Brave New World, and I'll just read a quick little—quick [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  sentence. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=407.74s)]
*  But truth, amenas, science is a public danger. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=408.74s)]
*  Science is a public danger. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=414.74s)]
*  Science is a public danger because it seeks the truth. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=416.38s)]
*  And here's an administration that can't handle seeking the truth. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=419.94s)]
*  And the circumstance you just talked about is all about that, isn't it? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=423.65999999999997s)]
*  And in your sense, your advice to scientists who are now facing the recruitment efforts [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=429.7s)]
*  of Europe and Canada and Australia and versus the cuts of the Trump administration? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=437.98s)]
*  Well, I don't think they have any choice. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=445.46000000000004s)]
*  They've got to take these grants. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=448.26s)]
*  Their, you know, their current positions are being demolished. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=450.3s)]
*  When you take a 40 percent haircut for the National Institutes of Health, which is the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=454.86s)]
*  crown jewel of biomedical research in the United States, it's the crown jewel, the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=460.06s)]
*  crown jewel. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=466.34000000000003s)]
*  Ninety-nine percent of the drugs that are approved by the FDA come directly as a result [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=467.62s)]
*  of the National Institutes of Health. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=475.18s)]
*  And we have fired thousands of scientists there already, demoted the key people. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  They're going to head out and go to Europe. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=482.86s)]
*  You know, if we had a pandemic tomorrow, think of the issue we'd be in. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=485.53999999999996s)]
*  And there's some of the fired employees who remain anonymous have said, if we have [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=488.53999999999996s)]
*  another pandemic, we're screwed. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=495.53999999999996s)]
*  And not to mention Russia, China. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=498.53999999999996s)]
*  I think Australia talked about the Great America brain drain as the Great America brain gain [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=501.53999999999996s)]
*  for other countries. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=510.53999999999996s)]
*  And that's exactly what it is. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=512.38s)]
*  It's a brain gain for China, for Spain, for France, for Germany, on a go. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=514.38s)]
*  Oh, and Canada, too. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=520.38s)]
*  And by the way, also Australia. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=521.38s)]
*  So they're all jumping on the bandwagon. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=523.38s)]
*  And I guess we'll just have a dumbed-down society. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJnc1ieXiM&t=525.82s)]
