**Democracy Now!:** [January 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZZUjuUDy1M)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  New satellite imagery shows at least 144,000 buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed
*  since the Israeli bombardment began nearly four months ago.
*  That's more than half of all buildings in the Gaza Strip, including mosques, schools,
*  universities and cultural sites.
*  Corey Scherr of the City University of New York told the BBC,
*  "'We've done work over Ukraine.
*  We've also looked at Aleppo and other cities, but the extent and the pace of damage is remarkable.
*  I've never seen this much damage appear so quickly,' he said."
*  In other news, the heads of multiple U.N. organizations are warning Gaza will face catastrophic
*  consequences if the Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA runs out of money.
*  The United States and over a dozen other nations have paused funding for the agency after Israel
*  accused 12 of UNRWA's 13,000 employees in Gaza of taking part in the Hamas attack on October 7.
*  Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to continue the war in
*  Gaza despite reports negotiators may be close to reaching a deal to pause fighting for at
*  least six weeks to make time for Israel and Hamas to swap captives.
*  Health officials in the occupied West Bank have denounced Israel for sending in a team
*  of undercover assassins into a Jenin hospital to execute three Palestinian militants in
*  a hospital room Tuesday.
*  The Israeli special forces were disguised as medical workers in scrubs and Muslim women
*  wearing headscarves.
*  Palestinian officials say one of the men killed was recovering in the hospital after being
*  paralyzed from an Israeli drone strike in October.
*  Najeeh Nassal is the medical director at Ibn Sina Hospital.
*  They killed the three youth, Basel and Mohammed Ghazawi and Mohammed Jalamni, in their room.
*  While they were sleeping on their beds in the room, they were killed in cold blood with
*  direct gunshots to the head.
*  In Washington, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller refused to condemn the Israeli
*  raid on the Jenin hospital.
*  I'm not able to speak to the facts of the operation.
*  You'd have to pass some kind of legal judgment, know all of the facts of the operation.
*  But as a general matter, they do have the right to carry out operations to bring terrorists
*  to justice, but they need to be conducted in a whole—
*  Including in a hospital.
*  So we want them to conduct their operations in compliance with their national humanitarian
*  law.
*  Israel has admitted it's begun flooding tunnels in Gaza with seawater, despite warnings
*  from the United Nations that the move could damage Palestinian drinking water and sewage
*  systems.
*  Israel said Hamas and other Palestinian groups have built as many as 450 miles of tunnels
*  where many leaders of Hamas are believed to live, they say.
*  In related news, the mother of an Israeli hostage who died in Gaza has accused the Israeli
*  military of killing her son by pumping poison gas into a tunnel where he was being held.
*  In December, Dr. Mayan Sherman said Israeli officials had told her that her son, Ron,
*  had been murdered by Hamas in Gaza.
*  But she started questioning what happened after a pathologist revealed a CT scan showed
*  Ron's body had no injuries.
*  In a Facebook post, Dr. Sherman wrote, quote,
*  "...the inquiry's findings.
*  Ron was indeed murdered, not by Hamas, not by stray bullets, and not in an exchange of
*  fire.
*  This was deliberate murder, bombing with poison gas," she said.
*  In news from Israel, a House panel in the Knesset overwhelmingly voted Tuesday to expel
*  Ofer Kassif for signing a petition supporting South Africa's genocide case against Israel.
*  Kassif will now face a vote from the full Knesset.
*  Kassif is an Israeli Jewish member of the left-wing Arab Jewish Habash party who has
*  repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Gaza.
*  Visit democracynow.org to see our recent interviews with Ofer Kassif.
*  Iranian presidential candidate Nikki Haley has called for the U.S. to assassinate Iranian
*  leaders after three U.S. troops were killed in a drone strike on a base in Jordan.
*  Haley made the comment in an interview on Fox News.
*  First, you do the sanctions and you take out a couple of their leaders.
*  That's the way you start.
*  In their country?
*  If they're in their country, or you do like Soleimani when they left the country, you
*  figure out where they are.
*  Our special operations can do that.
*  And then you take them out.
*  The presidential candidate is the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President
*  Trump.
*  On Tuesday, President Biden said he's made a decision on how to respond to the drone
*  strike but did not disclose details.

*  think we need a wider war in the Middle East.

*  that reveal Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and other wealthy figures pay little
*  to no federal income tax.

*  Prosecutors accused Littlejohn of taking a job at the Internal Revenue Service in 2017

*  deep moral belief that the American people had a right to know the information and sharing
*  it was the only way to affect change, she said.
*  An Argentinian court has overturned labor regulations proposed by newly elected far-right
*  that would have cut benefits and made it easier to fire workers who participate in union strikes
*  and blockades.
*  The three-judge panel argued such reforms are unconstitutional, stating they first must
*  be approved by Argentina's Congress.
*  The ruling comes just days after labor unions led tens of thousands of protesters in a general
*  strike against Milé's austerity policies that have led to the severe devaluation of
*  the Argentine peso and other massive spending cuts.
*  Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife have been sentenced to 14 years
*  in prison for selling gifts they had received while he was in office.
*  The sentence came just a day after Imran Khan, who's already in prison, received a separate
*  sentence of 10 years after being convicted of leaking state secrets by waiving a classified
*  Pakistani document during a public rally.
*  It was later revealed the document exposed to have the U.S. government encourage Pakistani
*  officials to remove Khan from office in 2022 after he took a neutral stance on Russia's
*  invasion of Ukraine.
*  Imran Khan was ousted from office in April 2022 after lawmakers passed a no-confidence
*  vote.
*  On Tuesday, supporters of Khan denounced the Pakistani judiciary for targeting him just
*  ahead of next week's elections.

*  to impeaching a Cabinet official for the first time in nearly 150 years.

*  border.
*  If the full House votes to impeach Mayorkas, the articles would then be referred to the
*  Democratic-controlled Senate.
*  Democratic lawmakers have denounced the Republican impeachment effort.
*  In other news from Capitol Hill, Democratic Congressmember Cori Bush has acknowledged
*  she's under a Justice Department investigation for allegedly misusing campaign funds.
*  In a statement, Bush said, quote,
*  In recent months, right-wing organizations have lodged baseless complaints against me,
*  peddling notions that I have misused campaign funds to pay for personal security services.
*  That simply is not true, she said.
*  Last year, the Office of Congressional Ethics investigated Bush's campaign spending and
*  voted to dismiss the allegations.
*  Bush's security needs increased after she faced numerous death threats.
*  In Ohio, a 20-year-old white supremacist has been sentenced to 18 years in prison after

*  The other bill would limit the amount of time people in custody are placed in solitary confinement
*  in the city's troubled jail system.
*  Councilmembers supporting the override included the newly elected Harlem Councilmember Youssef
*  Salam, who is one of five Black and Latinx teenagers wrongfully convicted of the 1989
*  beating and rape of a white woman in Central Park.
*  Salam spent seven years in prison, including in solitary confinement, before being exonerated.
*  On Tuesday, he delivered emotional remarks before voting aye.
*  I vote aye because today the New York City Council is fighting for the implementation
*  of two bills that would bring generational change in our criminal justice system.
*  If these laws were in place in 1989, I vote aye.
*  Youssef Salam's vote came just days after he was pulled over by police while driving
*  with his wife and daughters.
*  He said the officer never responded to his request to know why he was being stopped.
*  Later the officer would say it was because his windows were tinted too dark and raised
*  the issue of him having an out-of-state license plate.

*  Salinas named his action $1,198.80 for the last 300 last breaths of hope.
*  Starbucks has faced widespread boycotts across the globe over its refusal to support a ceasefire
*  in Gaza.
