# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” November 5, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmipXQYseM8)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, War, Peace and the Presidency.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Today is Election Day.
*  Over 78 million people across the United States have already voted in early voting, with record
*  participation in battleground states like North Carolina and Georgia.
*  Control of Congress is at stake, with 34 Senate seats and the entire House of Representatives
*  up for election.
*  Of those, the Cook Political Report says 22 House races and four Senate races as toss-ups.
*  Republicans need to pick up two seats to gain a majority in the Senate, while Democrats
*  are just four seats short of taking back the House.
*  On Monday, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump both campaigned in the swing state of Pennsylvania.
*  Harris wrapped up her campaign with a final rally in Philadelphia.
*  I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America.
*  However, the race ain't over yet, and we must finish strong.
*  And this could be, this could be one of the closest races in history.
*  Every single vote matters.
*  Harris was joined by Opal Rinfrey at her closing rally, which also featured performances by
*  Ricky Martin, Lady Gaga and Will.i.am.
*  Donald Trump delivered his closing speech in Grand Rapids, Michigan, as he had in the
*  last two election seasons.
*  Earlier in the day, he spoke from Reading, Pennsylvania.
*  November 5th, 2024 will be Liberation Day in America.
*  And on day one I will launch the largest deportation program of criminals in American history.
*  We're going to get them out.
*  We have to.
*  I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.
*  You know, 1798.
*  That's when they ran the country a little tougher than we run it today.
*  Trump's final hate-filled anti-immigrant rallies came as Politico reported the Trump
*  campaign recently fired a white nationalist field director in Western Pennsylvania.
*  24-year-old Luke Meyer, known online as Alberta Barbarossa, was a co-host of the podcast Alexandria,
*  with far-right media personality Richard Spencer.
*  Speaking as his virtual alter ego, Meyer once said, quote,
*  "'Why can't we make New York, for example, white again?
*  Why can't we clear out and reclaim Miami?' he asked.
*  Also at stake in today's election, abortion, which is on the ballot in a record 10 states.
*  Reproductive rights supporters are watching Florida especially closely, where a ballot
*  Amendment 4 could restore abortion access after Republicans imposed a six-week ban.
*  A Pennsylvania judge Monday declined to halt Elon Musk's $1 million daily giveaway to
*  swing state voters who sign on to his Super PAC pledge.
*  Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner had sought to shut down the scheme, calling
*  it an illegal lottery.
*  Palestinian medical sources say at least 70 people were killed by Israeli attacks on
*  the Gaza Strip over the last 24 hours.
*  At least 20 people were killed in the besieged northern town of Beit Lahiya when an Israeli
*  airstrike ripped through two homes.
*  Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers have withdrawn from the Kamal Adwan Hospital after raiding
*  it for a second day in a row.
*  The hospital had already been operating with a skeleton crew after Israeli forces last
*  week detained dozens of medical workers there.
*  Israel's most recent attacks damaged the hospital's upper floors where the Children's
*  Ward was located, seriously wounding a child who was recovering from surgery.
*  On Monday, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said the amount of aid entering
*  Gaza reached a new low in October with a daily average of just 30 trucks entering into
*  Gaza.
*  That's just 6 percent of the cargo allowed to cross before Israel began its assault on
*  Gaza nearly 13 months ago.
*  Palestinians say the situation will be even worse after Israel this week formally ended
*  a decades-old cooperation agreement that allowed UNRWA to operate.
*  This is considered a death sentence for Palestinians inside the Gaza Strip.
*  How many thousand students will be deprived of schooling?
*  How many thousand patients will be deprived of treatment?
*  How many thousand employees will lose their jobs?
*  How many thousand people will be deprived of aid?
*  This is a violation of international norms and the laws that exist in the world.
*  This comes as the Biden administration continues to provide weapons and ammunition to Israel,
*  ignoring foreign assistance laws that bar such aid to countries that commit gross human
*  rights violations.
*  On Monday, Associated Press reporter Matt Lee asked State Department spokesperson Matt
*  Miller to grade Israel's response to that 30-day deadline imposed by the U.S. to end
*  its starvation campaign in northern Gaza.
*  They certainly do not have a passcode.
*  They have failed to implement all of the things that we recommend in that letter.
*  Now, that said, we are not at the end of the 30-day period.
*  It's not the end of the semester.
*  You don't hand out grades in the middle.
*  I suspect that the levity is a little bit inappropriate.
*  I expect that the levity is a little bit inappropriate, said AP reporter Matt Lee, as the State
*  Department spokesperson Matt Miller chuckled at his own joke.
*  Israeli forces have killed at least four Palestinians during airstrikes on the occupied West Bank.
*  Two Palestinians were killed by an Israeli drone attack near the city of Kabatia and
*  two others in an aerial attack on Tamun outside the city of Nablus.
*  The killings come after armed Israeli settlers launched a wave of attacks on West Bank Palestinians
*  burning their homes and property and destroying olive trees.
*  On Sunday evening, settlers torched more than 20 vehicles in the city of Al-Bidai.
*  While in the town of Deir Dibwan near Ramallah, settlers scrawled hateful graffiti on walls
*  and set fire to a parking lot.
*  Elsewhere, settlers burned dozens of olive trees in a grove on Palestinian land in the
*  town of Berkha, northwest of Nablus.
*  When Palestinians tried to put out the flames, they say they were beaten by settlers who
*  also threw rocks at them.
*  Israeli strikes on Lebanon Monday killed at least 15 people and wounded 90 others.
*  The attacks bring the overall death toll from Israeli attacks on Lebanon to more than 3,000.
*  Hezbollah responded by firing rockets toward Israel and what said were attacks on soldiers'
*  barracks and other military targets.
*  Lebanon's national news agency reports Israeli attacks have devastated 37 towns across southern
*  Lebanon, destroying more than 40,000 housing units.
*  Syria's government has condemned Israel for carrying out airstrikes in a civilian
*  area south of the capital, Damascus.
*  On Monday, Syrian media reported two people were killed and five others wounded when Israeli
*  warplanes launched an air attack from the direction of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
*  Israel's air force later claimed it had hit Hezbollah targets in Syria.
*  In Russia, President Vladimir Putin met at the Kremlin Monday with North Korean Foreign
*  Minister Choe Sang-hui.
*  Their meeting came as Ukraine's government warned 11,000 North Korean troops are in Russia's
*  Kursk region bordering Ukraine, preparing to be sent into combat.
*  Ukraine seized part of the Russian territory in a surprise counter-invasion in August.
*  In Brussels, NATO Chief Mark Rutte called North Korea's entry into the Ukraine war an escalation.
*  North Korean troops being deployed in Russia against Ukraine, this is a significant escalation,
*  and it makes us even more focused and determined to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs
*  to fight off the Russians, including the North Koreans.
*  In Ohio, a white former police officer has been found guilty of murdering Andre Hill,
*  a 47-year-old black man from Columbus who was shot dead while leaving a friend's house
*  in 2020.
*  Adam Coy faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole for
*  15 years.
*  Body camera video shows then-Officer Coy open fire just moments after encountering Hill,
*  who was unarmed, striking him three times in the leg and once in the chest.
*  Officer Coy was not using his body camera properly at the time, and he failed to administer
*  aid to Hill for several minutes as Hill lay dying.
*  In the wake of the killing, the Columbus City Council passed Andre's law mandating the
*  use of body cameras and requiring police officers to provide aid if they cause any injuries.
*  Elsewhere in Ohio, in Canton, two police officers have been indicted for reckless homicide in
*  the killing of Frank Tyson, a 53-year-old black man who died after police violently
*  pinned him to the ground.
*  Body cam video shows officers Camden Burch and Bo Schoenegger ignoring Tyson's pleas
*  as he repeated, I can't breathe, before losing consciousness.
*  Reckless homicide is punishable by up to 36 months in prison.
*  And in labor news, 33,000 Boeing workers on the West Coast approved a new contract ending
*  a strike that started over seven weeks ago.
*  The contract will raise salaries more than 43 percent over the next four years and includes
*  a ratification bonus of $12,000.
*  John Holden is president of District 751 of the International Association of Machinists.
*  We reduced the cost of healthcare and added other important insurance programs.
*  We secured a commitment for the next airplane program.
*  We got commitments on jobs for our facilities of maintenance to maintain the headcount.
*  And we made many other improvements.
*  Tonight, our membership voted to accept this contract by 59 percent.
*  You know, it's time for us to come together.
*  This is a victory.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, War, Peace and the Presidency.
*  I am Amy Goodman in New York with Juan GonzÃ¡lez in Chicago.
*  Hi, Juan.
*  Hi, Amy.
