*  the city. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=25.68s)]
*  Protesters in L.A. included former Marine Melvin Hill. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=27.16s)]
*  I'm out here because I was willing to die for the things we have in our Constitution. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  And right now, I think our constitutional rights are being violated, stepped on, trampled [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=36.56s)]
*  on and disregarded by our present commander-in-chief, which would be Donald Trump. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=42.2s)]
*  I mean, everything looks unlawful to me at this point in America. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=48.96s)]
*  In Philadelphia, over 100,000 people took to the streets. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=53.44s)]
*  Democratic Congressmember Jamie Raskin of Maryland addressed the crowd. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=58.08s)]
*  Yes, Donald, the Declaration and the Constitution were written by people who wanted to stop [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  criminal bosses like you from taking state power. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=69.36s)]
*  Major No King's Day protests were also held here in New York, in San Diego, Chicago, Seattle [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=73.84s)]
*  and other communities large and small. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=78.92s)]
*  In Lyons, Colorado, a town of just 2,100, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountain National [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=80.8s)]
*  Park, hundreds joined the protests. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  This is Larry Quinn, an Army veteran and longtime Lyons resident. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=88.16s)]
*  I'm Larry Quinn, and I'm in Lyons, Colorado, population 2,100. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=92.84s)]
*  And I'm here because my dad drove trains across France to defeat the Nazis, and then [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=98.36s)]
*  I served honorably, also in the Army. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  And I'm disgusted about the fascist regime we have. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=107.12s)]
*  The size of the No King's Day protests dwarfed the turnout for a military parade Saturday [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  in Washington, D.C., held on President Trump's 79th birthday and the 250th anniversary of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=116.56s)]
*  the U.S. Army. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=123.96s)]
*  The parade reportedly cost as much as $100 million. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=125.2s)]
*  Democracy Now! spoke to some of the protesters in the nation's capital. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=129.84s)]
*  My name is Brett Hines. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=138.04000000000002s)]
*  I live here in Washington, D.C. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=139.24s)]
*  And I'm here because I think that this is a waste of resources when we have hungry children [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=141.4s)]
*  and when we have people going to sleep without a roof over their heads. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=144.84s)]
*  And what does your sign say? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=147.96s)]
*  The sign says, they got money for wars, but they can't feed the poor. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  It's a good line from Tupac. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=152.52s)]
*  I'm Amy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  My sign says, no kings. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  I think that's the side? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  The other side says the emperor has no clothes from the children's fairy tale or fable. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm here because the president said that any protest would be met with hard force. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=168.0s)]
*  I wasn't planning on coming, but that's un-American, anti-constitutional, and so I had to come. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=175.08s)]
*  I was called to come. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=180.52s)]
*  I also think this is an enormous waste of taxpayer dollars. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=181.92s)]
*  As someone who got doged and lost my livelihood and my life's work to have him turn around [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=185.76s)]
*  and spend $50 million on this, I think that's outrageous. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=190.68s)]
*  What type of work were you doing? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  Bringing clean water to poor people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=198.84s)]
*  And what's happened to that program, as far as you know? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  It's gone. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=205.32s)]
*  My name is Aubrey Lowe. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  I was a captain in the Army for eight years. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  So I'm a veteran. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  I deployed to Afghanistan once. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=211.84s)]
*  I'm from El Paso, Texas, originally. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  I was a little nervous coming out today because I heard that peaceful protests might be met [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  with a big force, in somebody's words. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=224.04s)]
*  And so I let my folks know where I was going. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=228.0s)]
*  I let friends know. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=231.72s)]
*  And I'm glad that I've been able to be here without being heavily harassed. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=232.72s)]
*  So that gave me some hope. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=237.08s)]
*  Army Captain Aubrey Lowe, among those protesting Trump's parade in Washington. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=240.44s)]
*  Speaking to Democracy Now! is Dennis Moynihan. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=244.72s)]
*  For much of Saturday, news networks showed split screens of Trump's poorly attended [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=247.0s)]
*  military parade, alongside footage of the massive No Kings protests. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  Here in New York, organizers say as many as 200,000 people gathered at Bryant Park before [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=259.44s)]
*  moving down Fifth Avenue to Madison Square Park. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=265.24s)]
*  Democracy Now! is there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=268.59999999999997s)]
*  This is what democracy looks like! [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=270.59999999999997s)]
*  This is what democracy looks like! [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  Hi, my name is Jayshon Sadler. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  He, him. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  And I am a father. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=279.44s)]
*  I'm a guidance counselor. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=281.44s)]
*  I'm a community member and world citizen. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=283.44s)]
*  And I'm here now because I want to make sure that we preserve our democracy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=285.44s)]
*  I want to make sure that all people in this country are safe, regardless of if they're [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=289.44s)]
*  an immigrant, regardless of if they are straight or if they're gay or whatever they are. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=295.44s)]
*  Like, everyone deserves to be free and safe. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=299.44s)]
*  Can you say what your sweatshirt says? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=301.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=305.44s)]
*  It says woke, not the insult that you think it is. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=308.28s)]
*  And who are you? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=312.28s)]
*  And how old are you? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=314.28s)]
*  My name is Rue. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=316.28s)]
*  I'm 15 years old and I use any pronouns. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=318.28s)]
*  I'm here because I've seen first-hand how much destruction Trump's impact has caused [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=320.28s)]
*  on especially queer and trans youth. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=322.28s)]
*  I've been in and out of a lot of places like that and I've seen how hard people have taken it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=324.28s)]
*  It's really hard to be a child in a society where you feel like people don't want you to exist. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=328.28s)]
*  So I'm out here for people who can't be out here. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=332.28s)]
*  I'm very lucky to have a supportive father, but I know not everyone does. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=334.28s)]
*  So I'm out here to give a voice to the people who don't have one and to show that we're still here. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=337.11999999999995s)]
*  We're still out here. We're still going to be fighting. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=339.11999999999995s)]
*  And the fact that there are thousands and thousands of people out here today, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=343.11999999999995s)]
*  what difference does that make to you? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=349.11999999999995s)]
*  It honestly makes me so happy. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=351.11999999999995s)]
*  After the election I was really worried because I felt like the adults had kind of failed me. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=353.11999999999995s)]
*  Since I couldn't vote, I was really like, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=355.11999999999995s)]
*  you guys had all of the power, you guys could have stopped us, but people didn't. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=357.11999999999995s)]
*  And I was so worried. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=359.11999999999995s)]
*  I didn't even leave my house for a couple of weeks. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=361.11999999999995s)]
*  But now it's just great that there's so many people here and that I'm not alone. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=363.11999999999995s)]
*  Can you describe your flag to our radio audience, in addition to our TV audience, and hold it up? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=365.96s)]
*  So this is the inclusive Pride flag. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=373.96s)]
*  It has the regular rainbow stripes as well as black and brown for people of color in the queer community. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=375.96s)]
*  Also has the trans colors and the intersex flag to support those people as well. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=379.96s)]
*  It's Pride Month. What do you have to say to President Trump on his 79th birthday today? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=383.96s)]
*  We're not scared of you and I hope you have an awful birthday. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=388.96s)]
*  I am Dr. William D. Carter III. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=391.79999999999995s)]
*  I am the senior pastor at the Franklin St. John's United Methodist Church, which is in Newark, New Jersey. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=397.79999999999995s)]
*  And I came because I do not believe people's rights should be taken away. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=403.79999999999995s)]
*  No matter their immigration status, no matter their orientation, people should have rights. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=409.79999999999995s)]
*  And there should not be a king. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=415.79999999999995s)]
*  We elected a president, not a king. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=417.79999999999995s)]
*  That's why I'm here today, for this cause. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=420.64s)]
*  What does the sign say that you're holding? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=422.64s)]
*  It says, Prejudice Cowardous Accomplice. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=424.64s)]
*  And describe the flag to me. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=428.64s)]
*  Yes, this is an American flag. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=432.64s)]
*  Even as a Christian, I believe in the right of all people, no matter their religious perspective. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=436.64s)]

*  Your thoughts on your mayor, the mayor of Newark, Ros Baraka, being arrested as he attempted to, what he said, do his duty to enforce oversight of an ICE jail with three congress members. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=455.47999999999996s)]

*  I think that he is doing an exceptional job. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=474.32s)]
*  And I think him being arrested demonstrates his passion for the cause. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=480.32s)]
*  And just making sure that all people have rights. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=487.32s)]

*  I'm carrying the American flag and the trans flag. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=497.32s)]
*  Because I think those two represent me. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=501.32s)]

*  Because I believe that in America, we are a democracy. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=532.0s)]
*  We do not have kings. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=534.0s)]
*  This is not right. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=536.0s)]

*  How old are you? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=559.0s)]

*  We are working in support of the end SuperPats campaign. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=715.0400000000001s)]
*  As we know, the billionaires fund the elections, right? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=717.0400000000001s)]
*  Like what this image is implicitly saying is that [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=719.0400000000001s)]
*  the superpats campaign is a campaign that's going to be a big thing. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=721.0400000000001s)]
*  What this image is implicitly saying is that if you have 200 million dollars, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=723.88s)]
*  you could just buy it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=725.88s)]
*  You and I, maximum contributions we can give is $5,400. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=727.88s)]
*  It's insane that corporations can give whatever they want. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=729.88s)]
*  And so there was a ballot initiative in Maine last November [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=731.88s)]
*  that made superpats illegal. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=733.88s)]
*  73% of Maynards voted for it. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=735.88s)]
*  And so their goal is to get it to the supreme court. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=737.88s)]
*  What we do is we use augmented reality art and education [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=739.88s)]
*  to help people envision a world without the billionaires at the center. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=741.88s)]
*  And so their goal is to get it to the supreme court. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=743.88s)]
*  What we do is we use augmented reality art and education [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=745.88s)]
*  to help people envision a world without the billionaires at the center. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=747.88s)]
*  And so their goal is to get it to the supreme court. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=749.88s)]
*  So like we're in New York, everyone knows that [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=752.72s)]
*  public housing, or housing in general, is way too expensive. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=754.72s)]
*  So what we're doing is number one, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=756.72s)]
*  we're showing a dystopic image as far as where things are going. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=758.72s)]
*  We have a protopic image of like, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=760.72s)]
*  let's say, Redney and the real estate lobbies out the way. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=762.72s)]
*  This could be the future of public housing right here. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=764.72s)]
*  Community gardens, vertical farms, solar panels up top. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=766.72s)]
*  And what about this picture in the middle? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=768.72s)]
*  So this is, this is, Elan. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=770.72s)]
*  I honestly don't think that's going to happen. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=772.72s)]
*  I think it's going to be a big problem. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=774.72s)]
*  So what we're doing is we're going to be showing a dystopic image [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=776.72s)]
*  as far as where things are going. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=778.72s)]
*  So what about Elan? I honestly don't think they're beefing. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=781.5600000000001s)]
*  Because they didn't come, I don't think that Elan [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=783.5600000000001s)]
*  and Trump broke up because they still have the SpaceX contracts. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=785.5600000000001s)]
*  Like, show me the money. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=787.5600000000001s)]
*  But basically, yeah, the man has 200 million dollars, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=789.5600000000001s)]
*  made 200 billion dollars over the election. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=791.5600000000001s)]
*  Highest ROI ever. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=793.5600000000001s)]
*  And he's pretty much running the show. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=795.5600000000001s)]
*  With a crown on his head. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=797.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, pretty much. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=799.5600000000001s)]
*  So our goal is to do public teachings and demonstrations with this art. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=801.5600000000001s)]
*  Help people imagine a world without a billionaires. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=803.5600000000001s)]

*  Have people sign our petition. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=810.4s)]
*  And then once we get the process templatized, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=812.4s)]
*  we want to give other people materials to go to their neighborhoods and do the same. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=814.4s)]
*  Some of the protesters here in New York City [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=816.4s)]
*  were an estimated 200,000 people marched [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=818.4s)]
*  as part of the more than 2100 nationwide No Kings Day protests [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFggnw9NKBs&t=820.4s)]
