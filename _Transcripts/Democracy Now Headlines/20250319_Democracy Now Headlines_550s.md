Immigrant rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra, who has lived in the U.S. for more than 30 years, was arrested by ICE agents in Colorado on Monday. She was ambushed during her work break by ICE officials and is now being held in a private prison in Aurora. Vizguerra rose to fame during Trump's first term when she evaded immigration officials by staying in a church basement with her four children and was named one of the 100 most influential people of the year by Time magazine in 2017. "The courts may not save us, but we save each other," says Jennifer Piper, program director at the American Friends Service Committee, Colorado. "Only the people can save each other and make justice and democracy real." We also speak with Vizguerra's 21-year-old daughter Luna Báez, who says her mother had felt under surveillance before her arrest, including by people in unmarked vehicles. "It's something that is very, very scary," she says.

*  And they're not going to silence my voice. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=87.22s)]
*  OK, OK, everybody, Jeanette is on the phone right now. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=89.66s)]

*  Be strong. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  Thank you to everyone that is there. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  I really thank you for all the time you have been by my side during these 16 years we've [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=110.66s)]
*  been fighting. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=114.9s)]
*  I'm hopeful I'm going to be able to leave here and continue my fighting for others, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=116.58000000000001s)]
*  because inside here there are many injustices. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=123.14s)]
*  There are a lot of women that their cases are not being reviewed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=125.98s)]
*  And I'm going to try to help them, even being here in detention. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=128.70000000000002s)]
*  That was the immigrant rights activist, Jeanette Vizgueda, calling from an ICE jail hours after [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=133.3s)]
*  And her voice was on speakerphone to those who gathered to support her outside, the phone [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=141.5s)]
*  being held by her daughter. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=150.1s)]
*  We're joined now by two guests, Jennifer Piper, program director to American Friends [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=152.3s)]
*  Service Committee Colorado, doing coordination support for Jeanette, and Luna Baez Vizgueda, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=156.54s)]
*  the 21-year-old daughter of Jeanette, who is holding that phone outside the ICE jail. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=162.54s)]
*  Now, let's remember, this is Aurora, Colorado. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=167.78s)]
*  Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio, were what Trump, when running for president, promised [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=171.02s)]
*  would be ground zero for deportations. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=178.62s)]
*  I want to start with, Jennifer, what's happening here? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=182.82000000000002s)]
*  I mean, we know the case of Jeanette Vizgueda so well over the years, went into the Denver [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=186.62s)]
*  Church where she had taken sanctuary. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=192.3s)]
*  Why has she been targeted now? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=194.86s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=197.9s)]
*  Yeah, there is no reason for her to be targeted right now in terms of legally. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=199.06s)]
*  The administration doesn't have a valid deportation order, and their act to try and remove her [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  this week violates her due process rights. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=211.86s)]
*  In terms of any other reason why they might be targeting Jeanette, she's long been a [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  leader since she arrived to the United States in 1997. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=223.1s)]
*  She began union organizing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=227.54s)]
*  She joined an immigrant rights organization. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=229.14s)]
*  She was the first person in the country, among the first to make her deportation case public [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=231.7s)]
*  in 2009, and really exposed the machinery and the cruelty of our deportation machine, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  which is vast in the United States. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  No matter who the administration was, Jeanette has always stood and will continue to stand [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=248.1s)]
*  for justice and for dignity for all people. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=252.98s)]
*  And do you think that she was targeted because of her advocacy? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it seems possible in this environment. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=266.34s)]
*  We're still hopeful that immigration and customs enforcement will recognize their error and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=269.78s)]
*  reinstate her due process rights within the immigration system. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=276.7s)]
*  Her lawyer has filed a habeas and also a motion at the district court, at the Circuit Court, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=281.09999999999997s)]
*  excuse me, the 10th Circuit Court, to review her case. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=288.34s)]
*  And so we're hopeful that immigration will come to the table. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=292.7s)]
*  Bring Luna Baez-Vizguerra into the conversation. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=297.38s)]
*  Luna, you're 21. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=299.74s)]
*  I remember you years ago when we were covering Jeanette in the church. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=302.09999999999997s)]
*  Now, you were standing outside yesterday in the freezing rain holding up that cell phone [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=307.09999999999997s)]
*  so your mother could be heard. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=312.26s)]
*  You have said that your mother had noticed unmarked vehicles following her for the past [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=314.74s)]
*  few days when she was leaving work and when she was on break. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=319.53999999999996s)]
*  Can you talk about that and what your fears are right now? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=323.85999999999996s)]
*  I mean, the mayor of Denver has called for her to be released. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=328.09999999999997s)]
*  I would say in regards to kind of the unmarked vehicles, it's something that is very, very [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=333.7s)]
*  scary. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=340.06s)]
*  It's something that she—she's always very vigilant because obviously in her circumstances [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=341.06s)]
*  there's a lot to be worried about, especially just regarding documentation status. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=346.5s)]
*  And it comes to find out that there were also some people without uniforms that were kind [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=355.7s)]
*  of watching her from inside the store and that they were just waiting for her to go [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=362.82s)]
*  on break to be able to make their arrest. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=368.34000000000003s)]
*  I want to go back to 2017, when I interviewed Jeanette Vizguerra inside the First Unitarian [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=373.06s)]
*  Society, the church of Denver, where she had taken refuge. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=378.86s)]
*  Are you prepared for ICE to come in at any time? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=384.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=388.3s)]
*  We have an internal plan here at the church, and not only at this church, also at the church [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=389.3s)]
*  where Ingrid is, who is at the other church in Mountain View. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=398.78000000000003s)]
*  She has been in sanctuary for over three months. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=403.3s)]
*  Both churches are part of the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition, and each church has its [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=406.46000000000004s)]
*  own emergency plan. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=412.18s)]
*  I am also prepared. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=413.74s)]
*  Before coming here, I prepared a family plan in case ICE were to go to my house. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=416.18s)]
*  Part of the plan with my children was that one of them would be filming and the other [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=421.86s)]
*  one would be calling people from a list that I gave them. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=426.5s)]
*  And here we have a similar plan. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=430.41999999999996s)]
*  So I am prepared and so are the people here. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=432.94s)]
*  We hope that Donald Trump will respect these spaces. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=436.06s)]
*  It would look wrong from a moral standpoint if he came after mothers who were just fighting [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=440.14s)]
*  for their families. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=445.06s)]
*  So that's Jeanette Vizguerra back in 2017 during Trump won, the first Trump administration, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=446.14s)]
*  terrified that she would be removed from her children. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=456.26s)]
*  As we wrap up, Jennifer Piper, what is the plan right now? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=460.5s)]
*  Yeah, so over her entire case, her entire fight of the last 16 years, every moment, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=466.14s)]
*  her struggle and her leadership, her community have made the impossible possible. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=474.9s)]
*  So the plan is to continue to do that, to utilize the courts. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=480.53999999999996s)]
*  All of the congressional Democrats in Colorado have spoken out and called for her due process [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=485.9s)]
*  rights to be respected, as well as the mayor, the governor, as you mentioned. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=490.8s)]
*  That's all because of the power that Jeanette has built over her organizing career and the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=496.40000000000003s)]
*  connections that she has with other people. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=500.64000000000004s)]
*  The courts may not save us, but we save each other. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=503.56s)]
*  Only the people can save each other and make justice and democracy real. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=506.92s)]
*  And that's what we'll continue to do into the future. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=511.44000000000005s)]
*  We'll continue to have a presence at the detention center. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=515.12s)]
*  continue to support her family and their leadership. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=517.8s)]
*  They're really the ones who are leading this fight. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=522.08s)]
*  I want to thank you so much for being with us, Jennifer Piper, program director, American [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=524.72s)]
*  Friends Service Committee Colorado, and Luna Baez-Visguerra, daughter of Jeanette Visguerra. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=528.56s)]
*  To see our interviews with Jeanette over the years, you can go to democracynow.org. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rFE7Lxm0Vc&t=534.34s)]
