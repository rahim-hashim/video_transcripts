Holocaust survivors on Monday marked the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, where Nazi Germany exterminated over 1 million Jews and other minority groups between 1940 and 1945. The commemoration comes as the number of Holocaust survivors dwindles worldwide and far-right forces gain strength across Europe and the United States. For more, we speak with Israeli American historian Raz Segal, who says the academic field of Holocaust studies has a blind spot when it comes to Israel and its actions in Palestine, from the 1948 Nakba to the genocidal assault on Gaza. "Since October 2023, so many Holocaust scholars have gone out of their way to protect Israel," says Segal. "It's very grotesque."

# Genocide Denial in Holocaust Studies: Raz Segal on Gaza & 80 Years After Auschwitz Liberation
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=3.08s)]
*  On Monday, Holocaust survivors and world leaders mark 80 years since the liberation of the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=5.44s)]
*  Auschwitz Nazi death camp. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=10.0s)]
*  Events were held in Poland, as well as at the United Nations here in New York. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=12.4s)]
*  This is Holocaust survivor Dmitry Miklescu speaking at the United Nations yesterday. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=16.66s)]
*  At 8 years old, he lost his mother, sister and two of his brothers at Transnistria death [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=22.68s)]
*  camps. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=28.36s)]
*  Death was a daily presence. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  I saw my mother, my sister and two of my brothers die. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=39.16s)]
*  Only a few of us returned home. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=47.92s)]
*  And when we did, we had nothing left. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=53.96s)]
*  A Roma survivor of the Holocaust. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=58.72s)]
*  The commemoration came two days after the tech billionaire Elon Musk took a break from [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=62.08s)]
*  advising Donald Trump Saturday to give a surprise virtual address to the far-right AfD party, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=67.6s)]
*  or Alternative for Germany. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=74.32s)]
*  Musk's appearance came just days after he sparked controversy for twice, giving a Nazi [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=76.76s)]
*  salute at a Trump inaugural event. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=81.66s)]
*  Among other things, Musk told attendees it's time to move on from past guilt, an apparent [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=84.94s)]
*  reference to Nazism and the Holocaust, when he was talking to the AfD. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=91.06s)]
*  For more, we're joined by the Israeli-American Holocaust scholar, Raz Siegel, whose new article [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=97.22s)]
*  for Jacobin is headlined Genocide, Denial and Holocaust Studies. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=102.62s)]
*  He's associate professor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Sokton University, endowed [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=106.78s)]
*  professor in the study of modern genocide. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=111.14s)]
*  Professor Siegel, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=114.22s)]
*  Talk about the significance of this day, yesterday, the 80th anniversary of the liberation of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=117.42s)]
*  the death camp Auschwitz and how it relates to what's happening today. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=123.9s)]
*  Well, hello, Amy, and thanks for having me on the show again. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=128.66s)]
*  I think that it was very significant to see a Roma survivor speak yesterday at the UN. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=133.78s)]
*  I was there with students. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=140.9s)]
*  But it was also shocking, actually, to see that the rest of the ceremony focused on what [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=143.86s)]
*  you might call a genocide-generating world of lies, because the main speaker in the ceremony [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=151.5s)]
*  yesterday was Israeli President Isaac Hilso. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  And he came on basically to present Palestinians as Nazis, to present Israel's attack on Palestinians [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=162.01999999999998s)]
*  in the frame, basically, as he described it himself, the Jewish state defending itself [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=168.85999999999999s)]
*  from this ongoing attack, right, Nazis in the past, Palestinians today, rather than [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=175.85999999999999s)]
*  the reality, which is a stateless population, Palestinians under decades of Israeli-Sephard [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=181.57999999999998s)]
*  colonial rule, under siege, now under genocide in Gaza, and attacked by a very powerful [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=187.9s)]
*  state backed by all the Western powers. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=193.94000000000003s)]
*  And this is a person, of course, Isaac Hilso, that back in October 2023 defined all Palestinians [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=197.10000000000002s)]
*  in Gaza, as we remember, as responsible for the Hamas attack on Israel, that is, its enemies. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=202.02s)]
*  In December 2023, he went on to talk about civilization and barbarism, that is, Palestinians [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  and barbarians, and Israel as part of the civilized world repeated this discourse yesterday. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  So it was very shocking to see, you know, on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=219.22s)]
*  the UN, which we have to remember and remind everyone, right, Israel has killed now over [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=224.18s)]
*  338 workers in this attack, the majority of them UN workers, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=229.86s)]
*  So in the institute that Israel has killed so many of its employees, we see this, again, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=235.94s)]
*  what I call genocide generating world of lies, right? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=240.86s)]
*  A world turned upside down where people facing genocide become Nazis, become anti-Semites, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=244.14000000000001s)]
*  and this is all a grotesque, again, display of lies. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=250.7s)]
*  So this is what happened in the UN. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=256.58s)]
*  It's important to say that the Roma survivor, which was, again, very remarkable to see, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=258.18s)]
*  his message was that actually Roma continue to face attacks today, as they do. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=262.9s)]
*  States across Europe, also states that are committed, allegedly, to Holocaust memory, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=267.66s)]
*  they continue to face persecution and discrimination, and he called, actually, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=272.06s)]
*  called out and he said, you know, help us, you know, end this, end this endless persecution that [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=275.66s)]
*  Rome, persecution that Roma continue to face still today, right? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=280.06s)]
*  So he was also talking about the failure of what we call Holocaust memory and education, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=284.54s)]
*  but then we saw it really in a grotesque way and display with Israeli President Iskhar [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=288.70000000000005s)]
*  Herzog in attendance. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=294.3s)]
*  And Ross Siegel, could you talk about, in your Jacobin article, you've described a partnership [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=297.66s)]
*  between Israeli and German Holocaust scholars as troubling. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=303.58000000000004s)]
*  Can you explain how this partnership perpetuates the denial of Israel's genocide in Gaza? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so, I mean, in the field of Holocaust studies, Holocaust studies has always been based [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=317.34000000000003s)]
*  just to study of the Holocaust itself, and we have also genocide studies in what we call [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=323.1s)]
*  Holocaust and genocide studies, but Holocaust studies was also always based on the idea that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=327.26s)]
*  the Holocaust is unique. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  And this also meant that Israel, the state of Holocaust survivors or the state that portrays [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=333.42s)]
*  itself as a state of Holocaust survivors, the Jewish state, is also unique. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=338.86s)]
*  And this is really at the basis of Nakba denial, right? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=342.62s)]
*  The idea that Israel cannot perpetrate any crime under international law, let alone [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=346.06s)]
*  genocide. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=350.94s)]
*  So this was very central also in Holocaust studies, always this kind of protection for [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=351.42s)]
*  Israel from criticism and really the perpetuation of Nakba denial, the denial of the ongoing [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=356.78s)]
*  Nakba as well, the continued assault on Palestinians. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=363.58s)]
*  And this is what we see today. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=366.85999999999996s)]
*  This is the reason that since September 2023, so many Holocaust scholars have actually gone [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=368.85999999999996s)]
*  out of their way to protect Israel, to attack other Holocaust and genocide scholars like [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=373.73999999999995s)]
*  myself, including many Jews, including Israelis who speak out about Israel's attack on Gaza, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=379.58s)]
*  who speak on the basis of the mountain of evidence that we have today about Israel's [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=385.26s)]
*  attack on Gaza. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=389.58s)]
*  But again, it's very grotesque that we see it among Holocaust scholars. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=390.7s)]
*  I wrote this piece about an event that took place online organized by the Western Galil [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=394.38s)]
*  College in Israel, where there is a Holocaust program and a strong collaboration between [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=399.74s)]
*  Israeli and German Holocaust scholars. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=404.62s)]
*  And the whole event was actually designed as an attack against Holocaust and genocide [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=408.94s)]
*  scholars like myself who speak about Israel's attack on Gaza. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=413.26s)]
*  We were portrayed as anti-Zionists and therefore anti-Semites, right? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=417.02s)]
*  So this equation of anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=420.86s)]
*  But there was also just crude genocide denial. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=425.5s)]
*  One of the speakers there, Verena Brüster, for example, was a German scholar in Berlin [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=428.46s)]
*  that teaches online in Israel in that program. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=433.18s)]
*  Outright said minimizing the number of Palestinians killed by Israel, saying that there's no [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=436.3s)]
*  starvation. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=441.18s)]
*  These kinds of outright crude denials go against all the evidence that we have. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=442.14s)]
*  But again, we see it in the frame of Holocaust studies now. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=448.3s)]
*  This is rooted in the history of this field that was always based, again, on the idea [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=451.90000000000003s)]
*  that Israel is a unique state, right? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=456.3s)]
*  That Israel cannot perpetrate any crime under international law impunity for Israel and [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=458.3s)]
*  the international legal system, but also in this field. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=463.34000000000003s)]
*  And therefore, we see this kind of denial reproduced today. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=466.46000000000004s)]
*  We saw it in this event that I wrote about. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=469.74s)]
*  Professor, I wanted to just end by asking you about what just happened at the American [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=471.58000000000004s)]
*  Historical Association. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=476.62s)]
*  I saw you a few weeks ago here in New York at Hilton when members of the group voted [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=478.38000000000005s)]
*  overwhelmingly, 428 to 88, to oppose scholasticide in Gaza. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=484.22s)]
*  If you can talk about what happened next—I was talking to a past president of the American [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=491.1s)]
*  Historical Association. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=496.78s)]
*  They said, oh, I'm sure they're going to have to go along with that vote because it [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=497.9s)]
*  was so overwhelming. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=502.86s)]
*  But they vetoed it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=504.62s)]
*  We have 20 seconds. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=506.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the AHA Council unfortunately vetoed this vote. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=507.82s)]
*  Of course, this is an insistence on defending Israel at all costs. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=513.34s)]
*  I think that what we're seeing, of course, is U.S. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=518.78s)]
*  institutions standing behind the defense of Israel, because if we come to terms with [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=520.78s)]
*  what Israel is doing, which is Israeli settler colonialism, this then means that the settler [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=526.54s)]
*  colonialism is out of the bottle. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=530.86s)]
*  We have to talk also about settler colonialism here in the U.S. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0tYAM8nwx0&t=532.38s)]
