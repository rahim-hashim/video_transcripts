# Top U.S. & World Headlines — August 16, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XESqULx2B6M)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In Doha, officials from Egypt, Qatar and U.S. and Israel are meeting for the second day
*  of negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release agreement.
*  The U.S. indicates some progress has been made, as regional tensions remain high in
*  the wake of the Israeli assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders in Iran and Lebanon.
*  Israel's call this week's talks the last chance to make a deal.
*  Hamas is not directly participating, but is being briefed by Qatari and Egyptian mediators.
*  This comes as Israel continues its deadly war on Gaza, killing more children in an overnight
*  attack on a building in the Jubalya refugee camp in the southern city of Khajounis.
*  Some displaced Palestinians are sheltering at a cemetery.
*  I can see that every day the number of martyrs will increase.
*  Yesterday there was a bloodbath in the Abu Shahma family and the Wawidah family, in which
*  people died and people are still under the rubble.
*  And as we sit in the cemetery, more and more martyrs are being brought in.
*  One feels that they don't know whether they're dead or alive.
*  I tell you, I hope to die.
*  One hates living now.
*  Unfortunately, there is no joy in living at all and one doesn't want to keep living.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Israeli settlers shot and killed at least one Palestinian,
*  critically wounding another Thursday as a horde of armed settlers attacked a Palestinian
*  village near the city of Qaqilya.
*  Over 620 Palestinians have been killed by Israel in the occupied West Bank since October
*  7th, while the official death toll in Gaza topped 40,000 this week.
*  The true toll is certain to be far higher.
*  The Biden administration has announced patients will pay lower prices on 10 high-cost and
*  common prescription drugs, including blood thinners and arthritis medication, the result
*  of the first round of Medicare negotiations.
*  The new costs range from 38 percent to 79 percent lower than the current list price,
*  but won't go into effect until 2026.
*  Medicare would have saved $6 billion if the new prices had already been in effect last
*  year.
*  On Thursday, President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris touted the landmark deal as
*  they appeared on stage in Maryland for their first joint event since Biden withdrew from
*  the presidential race.
*  You may have heard about the migrant Republican Project 2025 plan.
*  They want to repeal Medicare's power to negotiate drug prices, let Big Pharma back
*  to charge them whatever they want.
*  Let me tell you what our Project 2025 is.
*  Beat the hell out of them.
*  We'll have more on Project 2025 after headlines.
*  Meanwhile, Kamala Harris is expected to announce a plan to ban corporate price gouging on
*  groceries as part of an economic policy speech later today.
*  In more election news, the immigrant rights group Make the Road Action has announced its
*  support for Kamala Harris in its first-ever general election presidential endorsement.
*  The group acknowledged the vice president has a check or track record on immigration,
*  including warning migrants do not come during a visit to Guatemala.
*  The Biden administration has launched a major crackdown on asylum seekers at the border,
*  but Make the Road Action says its members see Harris as someone they can work with and
*  someone who has a similar lived experience as a daughter of immigrants.
*  Arizona's Supreme Court ruled the state's Republican-controlled Legislative Council
*  can use the phrase unborn human beings to refer to embryos and fetuses in an informational
*  pamphlet for voters about a November ballot measure that seeks to enshrine abortion access
*  in Arizona's constitution.
*  The group Reproductive Freedom for All Arizona said, quote,
*  This decision is beyond disgraceful, but no matter what type of dirty tricks they try
*  to pull to slow down our momentum, we know Arizonans will show up and vote for their
*  freedoms this November, they said.
*  Doctors across India are poised to halt nonessential medical services Saturday in a nationwide
*  24-hour strike to protest the brutal rape and murder of a female medical trainee at
*  a hospital in Kolkata.
*  The body of the 31-year-old was discovered in a hospital seminar room where she had gone
*  to rest after a lengthy shift.
*  A hospital volunteer has since been arrested for the crime.
*  Earlier today, medical workers launched solidarity protests in New Delhi.
*  My local was brutally murdered, so we want justice for her, as well as the vandalizing
*  of the properties of the hospital.
*  We are against it.
*  What we want is justice given to a fellow resident who was brutally murdered and also
*  central protection for protection of the doctors so that there is no further incident happening
*  in future.
*  Protesters say India's government has failed to tackle sexual violence since the 2012 gang
*  rape and murder of a young woman on a bus in Delhi sparked nationwide protests.
*  In Thailand, the parliament has selected Pintongtarn Shinawatra as prime minister, days after Thailand's
*  constitutional court removed the former Thai leader over alleged ethics violations at 37
*  years old.
*  Pintongtarn is the youngest person to lead Thailand, and the fourth member of the Shinawatra
*  family selected as prime minister.
*  Her father, billionaire tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra, spent 15 years in exile after his ouster and
*  a military coup in 2006.
*  He returned to Thailand last year.
*  Last week, Thailand's constitutional court disbanded the progressive move-forward opposition
*  party, saying it broke laws that bar public criticism of Thailand's royal family.
*  The party have been critical of Thailand's powerful military, as well as unelected and
*  unaccountable institutions, including the Thai Senate and constitutional court.
*  In Indonesia, outgoing President Joko Widodo held his first Cabinet meeting in the country's
*  soon-to-be new capital, Nusantara, this week.
*  This comes ahead of Saturday's scaled-down Independence Day celebrations, as construction
*  of Nusantara on the island of Borneo continues to face a series of challenges.
*  Widodo announced plans in 2019 to shift Indonesia's capital away from the heavily polluted and
*  fast-sinking Jakarta.
*  But indigenous communities say they're being kicked off their land and have suffered health
*  and other problems from the construction of the $30 billion project.
*  Ukraine says its troops are now in full control of the Russian town of Sucha in the Kursk
*  region and are setting up a military command.
*  Sucha is home to a metering station for Russian gas that's headed to Europe.
*  Kyiv says it's taken some 80 Russian settlements near the country's shared border since Ukraine's
*  unprecedented incursion into Russia began less than two weeks ago.
*  A court in Greenland has extended the detention of American-Canadian environmental activist
*  Paul Watson until September 5th, as Denmark considers as possible extradition to Japan,
*  or he could face a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.
*  The 73-year-old anti-whaling activist is the founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society
*  and co-founded Greenpeace.
*  He was arrested in Nuuk in July and is wanted in Japan for a 2010 direct action that sought
*  to disrupt Japanese whalers.
*  This is François Zemmere, France's former ambassador to Denmark and one of Watson's
*  lawyers.
*  Paul Watson's fight is not only for a world more respectful of nature, ecosystems, the
*  environment and biodiversity, but also one of principles.
*  And street vendors from across New York City rallied at Union Square to demand passage
*  of the street vendor reform platform.
*  Currently, thousands of small businesses are forced to operate in a shadow economy as they
*  wait years to receive vending permits, all while facing fines of up to $1,000 and experiencing
*  harassment and property confiscation.
*  Democracy Now! is at Thursday's rally.
*  My name is Clotilde Juarez.
*  I'm a street vendor in Queens, New York.
*  I sell Mexican food.
*  We're here to demand that the city council pass the reform of the street vending rules.
*  We're tired of being criminalized.
*  Every week, there's a new video on social media showing police going after people, their
*  families, for thousands of parents, many of them single mothers who don't have other
*  sources of income for their families than working in the streets.
*  As you can see, we're not criminals.
*  We're working people who want to be part of the economy of this country.
*  We are the foundation of New York's economy.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
