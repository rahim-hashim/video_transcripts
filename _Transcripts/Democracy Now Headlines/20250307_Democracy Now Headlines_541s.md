Nicaragua announced last week it is withdrawing from the United Nations Human Rights Council, following a U.N. report that slammed the government’s human rights violations and warned the country was becoming an authoritarian state. The report by a panel of independent human rights experts adds to international pressure on the Nicaraguan government led by President Daniel Ortega and first lady Rosario Murillo, who was recently named co-president. “Nicaragua has become a country of enforced silence and surveillance for those who stay in the country, while those who dare to speak out face a life of exile and denationalization,” says Reed Brody, a member of the U.N. expert panel, who has spent decades investigating rights abuses in Nicaragua.

He speaks to Democracy Now! 40 years to the day since the release of his landmark 1985 fact-finding report Contra Terror in Nicaragua, which laid out how U.S. policy attempted to destabilize Nicaragua’s Sandinista government by funding the Contras and their campaign of torture, rape, kidnapping and murder.

*  We turn now to Nicaragua, which is withdrawn from the United Nations Human Rights Council [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=11.8s)]
*  following a report last month that urged the international community to address human rights [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=16.2s)]
*  violations by President Daniel Ortega's government. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=20.96s)]
*  This is the commission's chair, John Michael Simon. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=24.2s)]
*  Serious human rights violations have been and continue to be committed in Nicaragua, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=28.8s)]
*  requiring urgent global action. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=36.6s)]
*  Excellencies, since April 2018, President Daniel Ortega and Vice President Rosario Murillo [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=43.6s)]
*  have implemented a repressive strategy to ensure absolute control of the state. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=50.7s)]
*  The report marks 40 years since the release of the 1985 fact-finding report, Contra Terror [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=58.699999999999996s)]
*  in Nicaragua, which laid out how U.S. policy attempted to destabilize Nicaragua through [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  a campaign of terror directed at its people by funding the Contras. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=72.12s)]
*  President Ronald Reagan described the Contras at the time as, quote, the moral equal of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=76.64s)]
*  our Founding Fathers, sending millions of dollars in funding to the Contras. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=81.08s)]
*  The testimony of the victims of Contra attacks in the 1985 fact-finding report made it to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=86.78s)]
*  the front page of The New York Times and exposed the policy of torture, murder, rape, kidnapping [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=91.94s)]
*  and violence used by the Contras. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=97.98s)]
*  We're joined now by the author of that report, veteran war crimes prosecutor Reed Brody, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  who quit his job at the New York State Attorney General's Office at the time, spending months [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=107.5s)]
*  traveling through the war zones of Nicaragua collecting people's stories. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=111.9s)]
*  Reed Brody was recently appointed to the U.N. Commission investigating contemporary abuses [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=117.62s)]
*  in Nicaragua, which presented their findings last week at the U.N. Human Rights Council. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=122.98s)]
*  Reed, thanks so much for being with us today. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=141.9s)]
*  Talk about your presentation last week at the U.N. Human Rights Council, just in the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=147.58s)]
*  days before Nicaragua left the council. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=152.54000000000002s)]
*  So 40 years after my report on terror by the Contras, the anti-San Diniz de Contras in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=156.66s)]
*  I was appointed to a U.N. Commission looking at abuses in contemporary Nicaragua. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=166.42s)]
*  And unfortunately, what we found is that the government of Daniel Ortega and his wife Rosario [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=173.42s)]
*  Murillo have step by step eliminated all checks and balances on their power. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  Today in Nicaragua, there are no independent voices. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=188.54s)]
*  There is no independent press. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=192.32s)]
*  All of the NGOs have had to leave the country. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=194.86s)]
*  Four hundred and fifty-three Nicaraguans have had their citizenships taken away, former [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=199.18s)]
*  Sandinista commanders, the former vice president, human rights activists, former presidential [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=205.46s)]
*  candidates. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=211.34s)]
*  Nicaragua has become a country of enforced silence and surveillance for those who stay [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=213.26000000000002s)]
*  in the country. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=220.08s)]
*  And while those who dare to speak out face a life of exile and denationalization. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=223.42s)]
*  Let's talk about how this happened. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=232.54s)]
*  I want you to go back in time, especially for young people, to understand how momentous [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=233.77999999999997s)]
*  it was for the Sandinistas to take over. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=238.98s)]
*  And you did this stunning report 40 years ago today about the violence of the Contras. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=241.7s)]
*  Talk about what came next. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=249.11999999999998s)]
*  The rise of Daniel Ortega hailed as finally democracy in Nicaragua. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=250.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=255.46s)]
*  So, 40 years ago, I went to Nicaragua. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=256.46s)]
*  Like many people of our generation, we were excited by the Sandinista Revolution, which [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=260.54s)]
*  had overthrown decades of U.S.-backed family dictatorship under the Samosas. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=265.86s)]
*  And I went to Nicaragua with a colleague from the attorney general's office whose brother [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=273.42s)]
*  was a parish priest in a little village in Nicaragua. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=278.6s)]
*  And in that village, I came face to face with people who saying, you know, the Contras, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  this U.S.-backed—that the U.S. had armed and financed remnants of Samosas National [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=288.2s)]
*  Guard to fight against—to try to undermine the Sandinista Revolution, which had begun [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=293.34000000000003s)]
*  literacy programs, health care for the poor, doctors in rural areas. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=299.6s)]
*  But the U.S. was funding these Contras who were destroying all of that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=306.16s)]
*  And in this little village, I came face to face with victims of those attacks who said, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=310.76s)]
*  you have to go back and do something. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=315.88s)]
*  You have to tell American people what's going on here. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=318.24s)]
*  And so I came back to New York. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  I quit my job at the New York state attorney general's office, and I returned to Nicaragua [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=323.04s)]
*  and spent five months crisscrossing the war zones of Nicaragua and taking hundreds of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=328.64s)]
*  testimonies and put those testimonies together in a report. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=335.47999999999996s)]
*  And I came back to Washington just as Ronald Reagan was seeking assistance to the Contras [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=340.4s)]
*  and calling them the moral equals of our founding fathers. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=345.58s)]
*  And my report detailed these widespread atrocities, rapes, murders, burning of schools and hospitals. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=349.29999999999995s)]
*  And it concentrated enough minds in a divided Congress to deny assistance to the Contras. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=358.76s)]
*  I was attacked by President Reagan as a Sandinista sympathizer, and—but my report was used [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=366.52s)]
*  by the Nicaraguan government also to—in its historic case against the United States [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=375.04s)]
*  that condemned at the International Court of Justice American assistance and American [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=379.84s)]
*  aggression against Nicaragua. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=384.4s)]
*  So, we only have three minutes, and you have exposed so much back then and also today. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  Particular part of the report that has been so important to so many was what happened [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=393.71999999999997s)]
*  in 2018. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=398.84s)]
*  And talk about the co-presidents today. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=400.47999999999996s)]
*  So, Daniel Ortega—the Sandinistas lost the election in 1990. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=402.88s)]
*  Daniel Ortega then started purging the Sandinista party, kept trying for—running for president. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=406.88s)]
*  And finally, in 2007, he became president again and began to dismantle all the checks [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=412.64s)]
*  and balances on society. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=419.0s)]
*  His wife, Rosario Murillo, became co-president. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=422.52s)]
*  It should be noted that Rosario's daughter, Zoila American Narvaez, accused Daniel Ortega [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  of having raped her repeatedly for many years. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=433.24s)]
*  Rosario Murillo took her husband's side against her daughter and at that point began [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=437.0s)]
*  to rise in power to become vice president. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=443.36s)]
*  And then just two weeks ago, a new constitution was adopted in which she is—now you have [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=445.96s)]
*  a male president and a female co-president. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=451.92s)]
*  There's a male co-president and a female. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=455.12s)]
*  And all the other powers of the state have become mere organs to be coordinated by the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=457.68s)]
*  presidency. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=463.76s)]
*  of checks and balances have been sacrificed at the altar of this. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=465.52s)]
*  Now a family—I mean, Daniel Ortega, the man who fought against a family dynasty, the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=471.15999999999997s)]
*  Samosas, has now created a situation where he and his wife are co-presidents, and they [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=476.92s)]
*  can name their kids as vice presidents. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=481.4s)]
*  So, we have just one minute. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=483.56s)]
*  What happened in 2018? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=485.36s)]
*  So, in 2018, there was the protests first against the Social Security reform, and then [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=486.91999999999996s)]
*  it became a much wider protest. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=497.15999999999997s)]
*  And the government of Ortega Murillo decided to go at them with everything. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=500.52s)]
*  And they brought out the police, paramilitaries, and as we have shown in our latest report, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  the military— [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=510.91999999999996s)]
*  Which they denied at the time. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  Which they denied at the time. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=513.8000000000001s)]
*  And our report now, based on insider testimony, shows that the military participated in this [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=514.8000000000001s)]
*  repression. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=519.88s)]
*  And over 350 people were killed. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=520.88s)]
*  And that was really the beginning of what we see until today, in which progressively [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=523.4s)]
*  all of the voices in the country, unfortunately, have been silenced. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyl_URvvv4Y&t=529.0s)]
