Trump’s sweeping budget legislation has been described as the biggest Medicaid cut in U.S. history. House Republicans passed the bill early Thursday morning in a 215-214 vote. The legislation would trigger massive cuts to Medicare and Medicaid over the next 10 years, denying coverage to an estimated 7.6 million Americans, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Food assistance under the federal SNAP program would also see $300 billion in cuts, while adding billions in funding for Trump’s mass deportation agenda and giving the wealthiest Americans a tax break.

# “Theft from On High”: Trump’s Budget Bill Guts Medicaid, Medicare & More to Pay for Tax Cuts
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs)

*  On early Thursday morning, House Republicans passed the bill, giving massive tax breaks [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=16.32s)]
*  to the rich, while slashing spending for Medicaid, Medicare, food assistance and subsidies for [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  clean energy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=26.7s)]
*  The measure just eked through with a 215 to 214 vote that came after an all-night [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=27.7s)]
*  session and days of negotiation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=34.98s)]
*  Food assistance under the federal SNAP program would also see $300 billion in cuts while [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=36.9s)]
*  adding billions in funding for Trump's border enforcement and mass deportation agenda. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson praised the budget package speaking after the vote. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  We look forward to the Senate's timely consideration of this once-in-a-generation legislation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=51.3s)]
*  We stand ready to continue our work together to deliver on the one big, beautiful bill, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=56.98s)]
*  as President Trump named it himself. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=62.08s)]
*  Ahead of the House vote, Democratic Congressmember Greg Kassar of Texas confronted Republicans [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=65.3s)]
*  on the House Budget Committee on rising health care premiums for their constituents while [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=72.0s)]
*  giving billionaires more tax breaks. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=77.14s)]
*  In this bill, they're going to jack up the premiums on health care for the people that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=80.6s)]
*  rely on the marketplace for their health care. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=86.46000000000001s)]
*  And so I will hand the mic over, yield my time to any of my Republican colleagues that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=90.06s)]
*  want to address the amount of money that their tax-paying citizens are going to have to pay [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=95.58s)]
*  in increased premiums for their health care. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=101.34s)]
*  And what bothers me the most is that we want to hide it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=104.66s)]
*  Nobody wants here to talk about the fact that they're jacking up insurance costs on their [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=108.7s)]
*  own constituents while giving a billionaire a tax break. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=112.58s)]
*  Nobody on the Republican side pushing this bill wants to have an in-person town hall [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=116.42s)]
*  and look their constituents in the face and explain to them why they want to hand Elon [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=120.02s)]
*  Musk another $25 billion contract while jacking up your health insurance costs not just by [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=124.9s)]
*  hundreds but by thousands of dollars. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=130.5s)]
*  Again, they're the largest Medicaid cuts in U.S. history. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=132.62s)]
*  The legislation would trigger $625 billion in Medicare cuts over the next 10 years. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=137.3s)]
*  Some Senate Republicans have voiced some concerns over the measure and will now have to pass [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=144.78s)]
*  their own version of the budget, with all Democratic senators opposed to the package. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=148.94s)]
*  Republicans could resort to using the reconciliation process to avoid a filibuster. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=153.1s)]
*  For more, we go to Washington, D.C. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=157.17999999999998s)]
*  We're joined by Chris Layman, D.C. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=158.89999999999998s)]
*  Bureau Chief of the Nation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=160.5s)]
*  His latest piece is headlined, Trump and Johnson's Big Ugly Lie. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=161.82s)]
*  Chris Layman, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=166.45999999999998s)]
*  Lay out what's in the legislation. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=168.7s)]
*  Thanks, Amy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=170.5s)]
*  Always a pleasure. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=171.5s)]
*  Yeah, I would say the legislation is basically a mugging conducted by the 1 percent against [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=173.3s)]
*  the rest of us. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=180.78s)]
*  It represents the single largest upward redistribution of wealth effectuated by any piece of legislation [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=182.82s)]
*  in our history. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=190.98s)]
*  The tax cuts work out to about $4 trillion, and the chief beneficiaries are at the upper [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=193.5s)]
*  end of the income spectrum. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=203.66s)]
*  People earning $4 million or more, the 0.1 percent, will realize $389,000 gains in their [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=206.74s)]
*  after-tax income. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=217.34s)]
*  Whereas the lowest quintile of earners, who make $17,000 or less, will be on the hook [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=219.34s)]
*  for $1,000 and some change in their after-tax income. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=225.5s)]
*  And that number will rise over the 10-year course of this package. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=234.02s)]
*  The GOP has dishonestly peddled it as necessary, the cuts in the legislation as necessary fiscal [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=243.29999999999998s)]
*  discipline. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=252.62s)]
*  In point of fact, this package will increase the federal deficit by $3 trillion. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=253.62s)]
*  And you saw instantly the bond markets swooned on the news that this legislation has passed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=263.26s)]
*  The futures markets today are sort of in freefall. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=271.38s)]
*  So it is just an outlandish piece of legislation, you know, based on basic economic principles, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=274.82s)]
*  and it is a massive giveaway to the wealthy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=283.14s)]
*  You mentioned, you know, the historic cuts to Medicaid, to SNAP, to food assistance. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=288.7s)]
*  There's also just, you know, crass and corrupt lobbying giveaways. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=296.54s)]
*  There's a provision in it that prohibits all states from regulating artificial intelligence. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=301.34000000000003s)]
*  It's a staggering work of theft from on high. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=306.94s)]
*  And explain the on high. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=314.42s)]
*  Explain what the billionaires get in exchange for cutting Medicaid, triggering the Medicare [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=316.94s)]
*  cuts, cutting clean energy, cutting food assistance. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=323.66s)]
*  They get $2.5 trillion in tax cuts. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=328.74s)]
*  And that is—that's been the social contract, you know, behind the MAGA takeover of the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=332.74s)]
*  GOP all this time, you know. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=338.46s)]
*  The billionaires are more than happy to have Trump foment, you know, racial hatreds, you [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=341.94s)]
*  know, panic about the border, about DEI, what have you, go after universities, as we're [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=348.5s)]
*  now seeing. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=355.38s)]
*  All in exchange for this, for yet more obscene wealth, that, you know, as is crafted in this [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=357.1s)]
*  bill, is directly taking, you know, critically needed support and, you know, assistance from [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=366.5s)]
*  the middle class and the working class. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=376.74s)]
*  I want to ask you about the position of the Democratic Party in this. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=379.62s)]
*  The parties face widespread criticism, accused of failing to properly challenge Trump's [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=384.5s)]
*  agenda. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=389.82s)]
*  There's a new piece by the—in the New Republic that says, quote, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=390.82s)]
*  "'House Republicans managed to pass their draconian budget bill, which promises to make [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=395.22s)]
*  massive cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, food assistance early Thursday morning by a narrow one-vote [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=399.78s)]
*  margin that was only possible due to the deaths of three Democrats in this current Congress.'" [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=404.06s)]
*  It goes on to talk about on Wednesday, Representative Jerry Connolly of Massachusetts passed away [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=411.90000000000003s)]
*  after battling esophageal cancer. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=417.26s)]
*  He's the third Democrat to die in office this year and the sixth in just over a year. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=419.46000000000004s)]
*  In March, longtime Arizona, Congressmember Raul Grijalva passed away also after battling [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=426.26s)]
*  cancer and Congressmember Sylvester Turner of Houston, Texas, died six days earlier. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=431.26s)]
*  Can you talk about all of this? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=437.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes, this is, you know, an ongoing problem. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=440.41999999999996s)]
*  And obviously, this is all in the shadow of new revelations about how, you know, the Biden [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=443.34s)]
*  White House basically concealed the actual cognitive decline of the president. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=450.46s)]
*  You know, there is a huge derontocracy problem in the Democratic Party. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=456.34s)]
*  And we're, you know, it is not an exaggeration, as the piece you quoted says, that if we [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=461.65999999999997s)]
*  did not lose these three House members, this disastrous bill might have been stopped. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=470.21999999999997s)]
*  And it's also, you know, beyond the demographics, there is also just a basic, you know, failure [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=478.62s)]
*  of standing up for principle. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=484.65999999999997s)]
*  You know, there was an earlier budget showdown that could have produced a government shutdown, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=486.82s)]
*  and Democrats had leverage at that point to get concessions from Republicans in exchange [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=496.61999999999995s)]
*  for letting the budget go forward. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=505.21999999999997s)]
*  And Chuck Schumer just folded like a cheap suit in the Senate and gave the Republicans [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=508.17999999999995s)]
*  everything they demanded. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=514.98s)]
*  That's the sort of longer-term background to this disastrous bill that passed yesterday. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=517.5400000000001s)]
*  The Republicans know they can count on Democrats either to, you know, to put things bluntly, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=525.62s)]
*  to die or to fold. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=531.46s)]
*  And you know, this is a real problem. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=534.7800000000001s)]
*  I just want to note, Heather Cox Richardson, in her newsletter, points out that we're [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=538.0200000000001s)]
*  talking about the single biggest increase in funding to immigration enforcement in the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=543.0600000000001s)]
*  history of the United States, increasing ICE's detention budget from $3.4 billion a year [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=547.82s)]
*  to $45 billion through September 2029, a staggering 365 percent increase on an annual basis that [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=554.34s)]
*  would permit ICE to detain at least 100,000 people at a time. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=562.58s)]
*  Your final comment, Chris Layman, as we move on to talk about one of the people who's [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=568.0600000000001s)]
*  in that detention system, Mahmoud Khalil. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=572.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, I think it's, again, important to outline in this case that this boondoggle [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=576.42s)]
*  to the repressive and, you know, illegal ICE detention system comes on the back of another [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=584.1s)]
*  Democratic capitulation. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=591.9399999999999s)]
*  The same Democratic Senate voted to endorse the Lake and Riley Act, which erected this [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=593.66s)]
*  new system of detention and rendition that's operating illegally and without accountability [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=599.1s)]
*  in our country. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=605.02s)]
*  After, prior to that, the Democrats eagerly touted Republican immigration reform that [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=606.86s)]
*  included many of these same draconian provisions. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=613.38s)]
*  So again, it's a failure of effective resistance and moral leadership on the part of the Democrats. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=615.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's a disastrous amping up of this shadow, you know, fascist state. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=623.26s)]
*  And just to put an underscore on it, Heather Cox Richardson writes, it increases ICE budget [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=631.82s)]
*  for transportation and removal operations by 500 percent from the current $721 million [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=639.94s)]
*  $14.4 billion. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaNPGaYefs&t=647.42s)]
