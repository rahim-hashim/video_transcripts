**Democracy Now Headlines:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CenF5lha-Vk)

*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Makati is calling for a U.N. resolution demanding
*  an immediate ceasefire as Israel intensifies its assault on Lebanon.
*  The Al-Iair strikes Thursday killed at least 22 people and injured more than 100 others
*  in a crowded residential area of central Beirut.
*  Survivors recounted the terror of Israel's overnight strikes as they survived the—as
*  they surveyed the damage to their homes.
*  I was praying.
*  We heard the first strike, and I thought it was in my house.
*  The second one was much more powerful than the first one.
*  People went down barefoot.
*  They were screaming.
*  We didn't know anything at the start.
*  I went to see where the strike was, and I saw that in my house the glass and windows
*  had shattered.
*  We came and saw this scene.
*  It was a horrifying scene.
*  It was something unbelievable.
*  Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned multiple targeted shootings
*  of U.N. peacekeepers by Israel and southern Lebanon.
*  At least two peacekeepers, Indonesian, have been injured.
*  Such attacks violate international law.
*  A U.N. official warned the safety of more than 10,400 peacekeepers in Lebanon was, quote,
*  increasingly in jeopardy, unquote, from Israel's attacks.
*  This is Andrea Tenenti, spokesperson for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon.
*  We are there because the Security Council has asked us to be there.
*  So we are staying until the situation becomes impossible for us to operate.
*  This is not a conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.
*  This is becoming a regional conflict, something that we have been saying for a very long time.
*  And if it's a regional conflict, everybody will be involved.
*  So it's a duty for everyone to stop it, because we already seen just in the last few
*  weeks how many people have been killed here, more than the conflict in 2006, in just a
*  few weeks.
*  This comes amidst fresh warnings of a deteriorating health crisis in Lebanon due to massive displacement
*  and the Israeli targeting of health facilities and workers.
*  After headlines, we'll speak with the U.S. doctor in Beirut, who's been volunteering
*  in Gaza and Lebanon.
*  In Gaza, medical authorities report Israeli attacks killed at least 63 Palestinians Thursday
*  as Israel continues its siege of the northern Gaza Strip.
*  The situation at three hospitals in northern Gaza remains critical as medical workers struggle
*  to respond to forced expulsions ordered by Israel.
*  Dr. Hassam Abu Safiyah, director of Kamel Adwan Hospital, filmed this video from inside
*  the intensive care unit Thursday.
*  We are here under threat because our hospital will go out of service due to the continuous
*  threats to evacuate the hospital and due to the lack of entry of fuel to the Kamel Adwan
*  hospital.
*  From here, from the middle of the intensive care unit, I call on all the international
*  organizations and humanitarian organizations and the international community to stop the
*  occupiers from implementing their decision to evacuate the Kamel Adwan hospital and ceasing
*  its services.
*  Stopping the Kamel Adwan hospital from providing services means the ending of these children's
*  lives.

*  committing war crimes and the crime against humanity of extermination with relentless

*  It's been a bloody week for media workers in Gaza.

*  killed by Israeli forces also in Jabalia Wednesday.

*  the destruction of his home and the death of his family members.
*  In Israel, a court reportedly ordered the release of U.S. journalist Jeremy LaFredo
*  after he was detained earlier this week and held on alleged, quote, suspicion of serious
*  security offenses, unquote.

*  in Israel, three other journalists were also detained with LaFredo but released soon after.
