# Top U.S. & World Headlines — August 30, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epEH0iOsbC0)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The World Health Organization says Israel has agreed to a three-day partial pause in
*  attacks on Gaza starting Sunday in order to allow aid workers to distribute polio vaccines
*  after Israel's brutal assault led to Gaza's first outbreak of the paralytic disease in
*  25 years.
*  The WHO said the vaccination drive aims to reach 640,000 children under the age of 10.
*  So, we start the 1st of September, and we start in central Gaza for three days, followed
*  by South Gaza and then followed by the north of Gaza.
*  Due to the insecurity, the damage, the road infrastructure and population displacement,
*  but also based on our experience with these kind of campaigns globally and worldwide,
*  the three days might not be enough to achieve adequate vaccination.
*  On Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on a residential building killed eight people in Nuserat in
*  central Gaza Strip.
*  Meanwhile, Israel's military said it's withdrawing its forces from Hanyunas after
*  a three-week offensive has left much of the city in ruins.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Israeli soldiers, backed by armored bulldozers, are continuing
*  a wide-scale assault on Jenin for a third straight day.
*  Three people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a car which reportedly killed Wasim Hazem,
*  the head of Hamas, in Jenin.
*  Israeli forces withdrew late Thursday from Tulkarim and Tubas following a two-day raid
*  that saw several Palestinians killed in the widespread destruction of roads and civilian
*  infrastructure, including water and electricity.
*  Tulkarim residents assessed the damage after returning home.
*  Here where you were filming was the house of an old woman.
*  Since the first moment of the raid, they destroyed the house, and they entered the house behind
*  us.
*  There were walls and a road here.
*  They destroyed them.
*  My relatives' house, Yusef Shahada's house, was also destroyed using missiles and drones.
*  Vice President Kamala Harris has given her first major sit-down interview since replacing
*  President Biden on the Democratic ticket.
*  On Thursday, Harris appeared on CNN alongside her running mate, Governor Tim Walz.
*  The pair vowed to support the U.S. middle class, including through the child tax credit,
*  lowering grocery costs and addressing the housing crisis.
*  Harris also said she would not ban fracking, a reversal from her earlier position, that
*  she would continue to crack down on the border and that she might appoint a Republican to
*  her Cabinet.
*  On Gaza, Harris vowed to continue the U.S. policy of support for Israel.
*  We'll have more on the Harris Walls interview after headlines.
*  J.D. Vance has ramped up his attacks on Kamala Harris, saying at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania,
*  Wednesday she can go to hell.
*  Vance criticized the Biden administration for failing to fire anyone over the death
*  of 13 U.S. troops who died during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago.
*  Kamala Harris is so asleep at the wheel that she won't even do an investigation into
*  what happened, and she wants to yell at Donald Trump because he showed up.
*  She can—she can go to hell.
*  This comes as newly resurfaced comments show J.D. Vance claiming,
*  Childless teachers brainwash and destroy the minds of children.
*  He converted to Catholicism in 2019.
*  He didn't address whether nuns or priests should teach children.
*  Meanwhile, the Arlington National Cemetery filed a report after two Trump campaign aides
*  verbally intact and pushed an Arlington cemetery employee during a visit by Trump Monday.
*  The staffer was attempting to prevent Trump's team from taking photos and videos, which
*  is prohibited on cemetery grounds, as is political campaigning.
*  South Korea's Constitutional Court ruled Thursday the country's climate law violates
*  the rights of future generations in a major victory for the youth climate movement.
*  The landmark decision finds the absence of legally binding greenhouse gas reduction
*  targets is counter to the South Korean constitution and shifts too large of a burden on the country's
*  future generations.
*  Climate activists in Seoul celebrated the decision.
*  Our focus will shift to legislative and administrative capacity next.
*  I plan to find ways to drive change through these areas.
*  In the near future, I'm planning a campaign targeting the National Assembly.
*  In Bangladesh, ongoing heavy flooding has killed at least 52 people and displaced nearly
*  half a million people.
*  Authorities say more than a million families have been cut off by the floodwaters, many
*  of them without food or clean water.
*  In Yemen, at least 33 people are dead and dozens more missing after flooding from monsoon
*  rains triggered mudslides that swept through a district controlled by the Houthi movement.
*  At least one clinic in Yemen is reporting cases of cholera with concerns that continuing
*  rains could help the waterborne disease spread.
*  There are also reports of more than a thousand cholera cases in Sudan, where the U.N. says
*  over 300,000 people have been impacted by recent flooding, worsening an already dire
*  humanitarian crisis.
*  Residents of the city of Tokar in Sudan's Red Sea state have been leaving on foot after
*  the Arbat Dam collapsed, washing away bridges and roads.
*  People have no food.
*  They sit on high places and they have nothing, no food or water.
*  There are people who died and have not been buried yet.
*  There are people who are missing.
*  There are collapsed houses and others were swept away by the flood.
*  Authorities across Brazil have implemented emergency measures after a thick blanket of
*  smoke settled over major cities, including São Paulo and the capital, Brasilia, closing
*  schools, grounding flights and triggering air quality alerts.
*  The Amazon and the Pantanal wetlands, the world's largest tropical wetland, have reported a
*  record-breaking wildfire season amidst Brazil's severe drought and extreme heat.
*  Breaking related news, newly published data shows Canada's devastating wildfires last
*  year produced more carbon emissions than the burning of fossil fuels in seven out of the
*  ten worst-polluting countries.
*  The unprecedented wildfires ranked as the fourth largest carbon emitter in 2023 behind
*  China, the U.S. and India.
*  Environmentalists and indigenous communities in California and Oregon are celebrating after
*  breached the last of four dams along the Klamath River, completing the largest dam removal
*  project in U.S. history.
*  For decades, conservationists led by the Yurok, Karuk and Hupa tribes fought to remove the
*  dams, citing their heavy toll on salmon-spawning grounds.
*  Yurok tribe vice chair Frankie Myers said in a statement, quote,
*  Timor-Leste, or East Timor, is marking the 25th anniversary of its vote to become independent
*  from Indonesia.
*  East Timor had been under Indonesian occupation since 1975.
*  Indonesia killed more than a third of the population, over 200,000 Timorese.
*  After the 1999 independence vote, the Indonesian military and pro-Jakarta militias began attacking
*  civilians, killing an estimated additional 1,500 people and burning parts of East Timor
*  to the ground.
*  Timor-Leste Prime Minister Sinanah Gushmao, who had been imprisoned for years by Indonesia,
*  and President Jose Ramos Huerta, leaders of East Timor's independence movement, are
*  addressing the nation today.
*  U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres is in Timor-Leste for the occasion.
*  Guterres was the prime minister of Portugal at the time of the 1999 vote and vocal supporter
*  of East Timorese independence.
*  East Timor was occupied by Portugal before Indonesia invaded.
*  Earlier this week, Guterres spoke from the capital, Dili, where he addressed the climate
*  crisis.
*  Throughout the Pacific, climate chaos is affecting those who did the least to cause it, and this
*  is the time to act against climate change and to reinforce measures to protect the Timorese
*  people in the face of the intensifications of climate disasters.
*  But Timor-Leste cannot be alone in this effort.
*  The international community has an obligation to support them, namely through an ambitious
*  result at COP29 this year in terms of financial support.
*  Back in the United States, dozens of detainees at two immigrant prisons in California relaunched
*  a hunger and labor strike this month to protest their inhumane treatment at the Mesa Verde
*  and Golden State Annex facilities.
*  Both of the immigration and customs enforcement prisons are run by the for-profit prison company
*  GeoGroup.
*  Among other things, detainees report medical neglect, lack of drinking water, poor food
*  quality that's made them sick, sexual harassment and abuse, working for just a dollar a day
*  and retaliation for speaking out.
*  Protesters rallied in solidarity with the striking detainees in San Francisco Wednesday
*  and delivered copies of recent civil rights complaints to Senator Alex Padilla.
*  Police in Ann Arbor arrested four protesters at the University of Michigan Wednesday as
*  they attempted to hold a peaceful die-in protest against Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  The activists said, quote,
*  Here in New York, the campus group Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine reports
*  their Instagram account has been permanently banned, with no reason provided.
*  The NYU Palestine Solidarity Committee similarly had its Instagram account frozen, with no
*  opportunity to appeal.
*  Meanwhile, as students returned to the classroom at New York University, the administration's
*  issued a new code of conduct stating use of the word Zionist could violate nondiscrimination
*  and anti-harassment policies.
*  In a statement, NYU Faculty for Justice in Palestine says the policy, quote,
*  The president of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, Jimmy Williams,
*  Jr., says his union is directing its massive international pension fund to divest from
*  the Gaza genocide.
*  Williams spoke Thursday at the IUPAT's general convention.
*  In more labor news, thousands of United Airlines flight attendants have voted to authorize
*  a strike amid stalled contract talks with the airline.
*  Actors of the Association of Flight Attendants United Airlines haven't had a pay raise
*  since 2019.
*  They're seeking double-digit salary increases, more flexible scheduling, better pensions
*  and job security.
*  Meanwhile, voice actors and motion capture performers who work on video games are entering
*  their second month on strike, SAG-AFTRA's demanding a guarantee of consent and fair
*  compensation for actors who allow their images and voices to be used to generate artificial
*  intelligence creations.
*  And here in New York, a Long Island man is the first person to be charged with wearing
*  a face mask in public.
*  Police say the 18-year-old was wearing a ski mask when he was arrested Sunday and charged
*  with possessing a knife with the intent to engage in robbery.
*  A new law passed by Nassau County's Republican-controlled legislature makes it a misdemeanor crime to
*  wear a face mask covering in public, with narrow exceptions for health or religious
*  reasons.
*  Last week, the group Disability Rights New York filed a lawsuit against the mask ban,
*  saying it discriminates against immunocompromised people.
