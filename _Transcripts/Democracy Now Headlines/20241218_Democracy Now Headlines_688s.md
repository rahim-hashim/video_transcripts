*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Health officials in Gaza say Israeli attacks have killed at least 38 Palestinians and wounded
*  more than 200 over the past 24 hours.
*  Among the latest deaths were 10 Palestinians killed in an Israeli missile attack on the
*  Shati refugee camp and two women killed when Israel shelled a home east of Khan Yunis.
*  In northern Gaza, doctors were forced to close the intensive care unit at the besieged Kamel
*  Adwan hospital after an Israeli attack trickled a large fire.
*  The U.N.'s humanitarian office warns U.N. led missions to supply northern Gaza continue
*  to be overwhelmingly denied, with Israeli forces turning back three humanitarian aid
*  convoys carrying food and water on Tuesday alone.
*  Meanwhile, a senior Palestinian official involved in indirect negotiations for a ceasefire in
*  Gaza said talks are in a decisive and final phase.
*  News of a possible truce was welcomed by Gaza residents who've survived more than 15 months
*  of Israel's assault.
*  Let them stop the war so we can live in peace and they can open the border crossing for
*  us to bring in food and everything we need, flour, diapers and baby formula.
*  Let them bring in everything for us.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Israeli soldiers shot and killed two Palestinians near the
*  town of Sufin on Tuesday.
*  They were identified as 32-year-old Mohammed Ashkar and 31-year-old Dia Salmi.
*  Israeli forces reportedly blocked anyone from approaching the wounded men, leaving them
*  to bleed out before medical help could arrive.
*  The U.N. officials carried out near-daily raids across the occupied West Bank, killing at
*  least 800 Palestinians since October 2023 and arresting over 12,000.
*  A United Nations envoy has warned Syria's civil war has not yet ended, despite the removal
*  of President Bashar al-Assad by opposition fighters.
*  On Tuesday, U.N. Syria envoy Gerard Peterson told the U.N. Security Council Turkish-backed
*  armed groups are continuing to battle Kurdish groups for control of several areas of northern
*  Syria.
*  Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department said it had brokered an extension of a ceasefire
*  deal between Turkey and the U.S.-backed Kurdish-Syrian forces around the northern Syrian city of
*  Mombish.
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that his forces will remain in Syria
*  indefinitely, after Israeli troops expanded their occupation beyond the Golan Heights.
*  On Tuesday, Netanyahu and senior Israeli officials toured the peak of Syria's Mount Haramon,
*  which Israeli troops seized after the fall of the Assad regime.
*  The mountain on the border of Lebanon and Syria extends into and even beyond a U.N.-designated
*  demilitarized buffer zone.
*  This comes amidst growing international condemnation of Israel's plans to build new settlements
*  in the Israeli-occupied parts of Syria, which are illegal under international law.
*  Israeli military bulldozers have begun clearing land for new construction projects in the
*  Golan Heights community of Majd al-Sham, where Druze residents condemn the surge in planned
*  settlements.
*  Regarding this Israeli occupation, it is not surprising since Israel occupied Palestine
*  and Sinai and occupied the Syrian Golan Heights and Lebanon that it is currently starting
*  a new occupation.
*  Behind us, you can see the digging, which the Israeli army is doing, which is against
*  all international conventions.
*  Israel and Saudi Arabia have reached a breakthrough in talks that could soon result in an agreement
*  to normalize relations between the two countries.
*  That's according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which reports the deal would see
*  Saudi Crown Prince and de facto leader Mohammed bin Salman agree to a vague commitment to
*  a path towards Palestinian statehood rather than an explicit recognition of a Palestinian
*  state.
*  Meanwhile, human rights groups are blasting the International Soccer Federation, FIFA,
*  for selecting Saudi Arabia to host the 2034 Men's World Cup, citing the exploitation
*  of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia, the jailing of political activists for expressing themselves
*  peacefully and discrimination against women and LGBTQ plus people.
*  In a joint statement, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and others write, quote,
*  It's evident that without urgent action and comprehensive reforms, the 2034 World
*  by repression, discrimination and exploitation on a massive scale, they wrote.

*  pleaded guilty to participating in deadly bombing attacks in Indonesia in the early
*  2000s.
*  Before they were sent to Guantanamo, both men were held at secret CIA black sites where
*  they were tortured.
*  The U.S. will also release another torture survivor, Mohammed Abdul Malik Bajabu, to
*  Kenya after imprisoning him for 17 years at Guantanamo without trial.
*  In a statement, Amnesty International welcomed the prisoner's release and called for the
*  remaining 27 Guantanamo prisoners to be freed, writing, quote,
*  President-elect Donald Trump has escalated his attacks on the press.
*  On Tuesday, Trump filed a lawsuit against prominent pollster J.N. Seltzer for her polling
*  firm Seltzer & Company, The Des Moines Register and the newspaper's parent company, Gannett,
*  alleging violations of the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act.
*  Trump accuses them of, quote,
*  Trump claims news coverage of the poll just days before Election Day was intended to help
*  Harris.
*  Trump ended up winning Iowa with 56 percent of the vote.

*  Trump's presidential library to settle a defamation suit filed by the president-elect.
*  We'll have more on this story later in the broadcast.
*  On Capitol Hill, Democrats have selected Virginia Congressmember Jerry Connolly to serve as
*  the party's ranking member on the House Oversight Committee.
*  He won the role after defeating progressive Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez by
*  a vote of 131 to 84 in a closed-door Democratic caucus meeting.
*  The move rejected mounting calls to select a younger generation of lawmakers to serve
*  in leadership positions following Democrats' disastrous performance in November's election.
*  Connolly will be replacing Congressmember Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who will move on
*  to become the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee when Congress convenes on January
*  3rd.

*  Chido battered the Indian Ocean archipelago, leaving hundreds if not thousands of people
*  dead.
*  Amidst growing anger over France's slow response to the crisis, French President Emmanuel
*  Macron announced he'll visit Maillot on Thursday.
*  Maillot is France's poorest overseas territory.
*  Survivors have described apocalyptic scenes in which ramshackle homes were completely
*  blown away by 140-mile-an-hour winds.
*  It really is a war landscape.
*  Around me, I don't recognize anything anymore.
*  There's not even a tree left.
*  On the hills, there's not even a blade of grass.
*  It's impressive.
*  There were multi-story houses, and everything is gone.

*  CNN's own investigation determined that a person interviewed on a CNN video report
*  claiming to be a Syrian prisoner was actually a former intelligence officer in the Bashar
*  al-Assad regime, who once ran a notorious checkpoint in Homs.
*  CNN's report shows journalist Clarissa Ward and her team stumbling upon the person under
*  covers, who has now been identified as former Syrian Air Force Lieutenant Salama Mohammed
*  Salam, who claimed to have been held in a windowless cell for three months in a Damascus
*  prison.
*  We'll have more on media coverage later in the broadcast.
*  Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson
*  in New York, has been charged with first-degree murder and second-degree murder as an act
*  of terrorism.
*  New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced the charges Tuesday, saying Mangione intended,
*  quote, to sow terror.
*  Bragg described the killing as a, quote, frightening, well-planned and targeted murder.
*  26-year-old Mangione is scheduled for another court hearing in Pennsylvania on Thursday
*  to determine whether he'll be extradited to New York.

*  And in Greenland, the longtime anti-wailing and environmental activist Paul Watson has
*  been released from a Danish-run jail after authorities rejected a request by Japan to
*  extradite him.
*  Watson was arrested in July as his ship docked in Greenland before setting off to the North
*  Pacific on a mission to intercept a Japanese whaling vessel.
*  Watson co-founded Greenpeace and is the founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society,
*  which takes nonviolent direct action to protect the world's oceans and marine life.

*  The president and the former prime minister of France have been extremely helpful.
*  The president of Brazil has been, you know, intervened.
*  Bernie Sanders, my senator, has actually been very helpful.
*  The U.S. embassy has been very, very helpful also.
*  Andâ€”but really, the public pressure from all over the worldâ€”you know, I've received
*  over 4,000 letters while I've been in prisonâ€”has been really overwhelming.
*  If extradited to Japan, Watson faced a possible sentence of up to 15 years in prison.
