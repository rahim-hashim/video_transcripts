# Top U.S. & World Headlines — August 5, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkZBwbU-if8)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has resigned and fled to India after weeks of
*  student-led protests.
*  Bangladesh's army has announced an interim government will be formed to run Bangladesh.
*  Earlier today, crowds stormed Hasina's official residence in Dhaka to celebrate her ouster.
*  She had led Bangladesh since 2009.
*  Her father was Bangladesh's first president.
*  On Sunday, police violently cracked down as tens of thousands of protesters took to the
*  streets.
*  Almost 100 people died on Sunday, bringing the death toll in recent weeks to over 300.
*  Most of those killed have been student protesters.
*  Hasina resigned as protesters vowed to defy a military curfew and stay in the streets.
*  Nobody can stop us from marching today.
*  If we turn back and face them once, we will liberate Bangladesh.
*  And I want to tell my armed forces, brothers, not to align with the autocrat.
*  Either you with the people or stay neutral.
*  We'll have more on Bangladesh after headlines.
*  The U.S. has sent additional military forces, warships and fighter jets to the Middle East
*  as Israel braces for a possible retaliatory attack by Iran and Hezbollah.
*  Last week, Israel assassinated Hamas's political chief, Ismael Khania, in Tehran, as well
*  as a top Hezbollah commander in Beirut.
*  A number of countries, including the U.S., France and the U.K., have urged their citizens
*  to leave Lebanon, as fears grow of a broader regional war.
*  President Biden is planning to meet with his national security team today.
*  In Gaza, at least 30 Palestinians were killed Sunday when Israel attacked two schools sheltering
*  displaced people in Gaza City.
*  Officials in Gaza said 80 percent of the victims were children.
*  The attack came a day after Israel struck another school in Gaza City, killing 16 people.
*  Israeli forces also attacked the courtyard of Dera Abadah's Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital,
*  where displaced Palestinians were living in a makeshift tent, which caught on fire.
*  At least five Palestinians died.
*  They said Al-Aqsa Hospital was safe, and we stayed in Al-Aqsa Hospital because it was
*  supposed to be safe.
*  We were sleeping, believing it was safe, and suddenly a rocket hit, setting the tent
*  on fire.
*  A woman, who was this child's mother, was killed.
*  She was hit by a shrapnel in her back and died on the spot, martyred where she stood.
*  Israel also carried out airstrikes on the occupied West Bank Saturday, killing nine
*  Palestinians in the city of Tulkarim.
*  Hamas said three of the victims were members of its military wing.
*  In the U.K., unrest is growing following the deadly stabbing of three girls last week in
*  the northwestern town of Southport.
*  At least eight other children and two adults were injured in the attack on a children's
*  dance class, many of them still in critical condition.
*  The attack stoked violent far-right protests across Britain after early misinformation
*  identified the suspect as an immigrant living in the U.K. without documentation.
*  The 17-year-old suspect was in fact born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents.
*  Over the weekend, rioters raided and set fire to hotels used to shelter asylum seekers
*  in northern England.
*  The protest also led to some 150 arrests, with incidents reported in Hull, Liverpool,
*  Bristol and Belfast, among others.
*  Anti-fascist protesters have also gathered to counter the white nationalists.
*  On Sunday, Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the, quote, far-right fuggery.
*  People in this country have a right to be safe.
*  And yet, we've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques, other minority communities
*  singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist
*  rhetoric.
*  So, no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is, far-right thuggery.
*  The Democratic National Committee has announced Vice President Kamala Harris has won enough
*  votes from delegates to secure the party's presidential nomination.
*  The DNC is holding a virtual roll call ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which
*  begins in two weeks in Chicago.
*  Harris is expected to name her running mate today or tomorrow.
*  Over the weekend, she interviewed three top candidates—Minnesota Governor Tim Walz,
*  U.S. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.
*  She also met with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for 90 Minutes Friday.
*  In other campaign news, Donald Trump has dropped out of a planned presidential debate on ABC
*  scheduled for September 10th.
*  Trump now says he'll debate Harris, but only if it's hosted by Fox News.
*  In other Trump news, The Washington Post has revealed Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi
*  may have secretly given Donald Trump a $10 million bribe in 2017.
*  The Post reveals five days before Trump took office, an organization with ties to Egyptian
*  intelligence withdrew $10 million in cash from the National Bank of Egypt in Cairo.
*  According to The Post, former Attorney General William Barr helped block an FBI probe into
*  the deal.
*  We'll have more on the story later in the broadcast with Washington Post reporter Kara
*  Lenig.
*  In Sudan, the Rapid Support Forces killed at least 23 people Saturday in a shelling
*  on the besieged North Tharfar city of Al-Fasher, as the paramilitary group struggles to gain
*  full control over Darfur.
*  Aid groups warn the spiraling humanitarian catastrophe in Sudan could engulf the entire
*  region after famine was declared in the Zamzam camp for displaced people located outside
*  Al-Fasher.
*  At least 10 million people have been displaced amid Sudan's brutal civil war.
*  This is a woman at Zamzam.
*  Since we came to Zamzam, nothing has been provided to us by the organization, and we
*  are suffering from lack of food, water and everything else.
*  But we are staying here, thank God, until now.
*  We are eating simple food, thank God.
*  We need water, food, health care, and for God to lift this curse from Sudan, nothing
*  more than that.
*  In Somalia, at least 37 people were killed and attacked by al-Shabaab on a popular Mogadishu
*  beach Friday night.
*  The attack, carried out by a suicide bomber and gunmen, injured another 200 people.
*  It's one of the deadliest attacks this year by the al-Qaeda-linked group.
*  Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohammed has vowed, but so far failed, to eradicate al-Shabaab.
*  Tensions are rising one week after the disputed Venezuelan election was called for incumbent
*  President Nicolas Maduro.
*  His main rivals, presidential candidate Mundo González and fellow opposition leader Maria
*  Karina Machado, have repeatedly claimed their party received more votes, releasing its own
*  tally of last Sunday's ballots.
*  The U.S., Argentina, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Uruguay have recognized Mundo González
*  as president-elect, while Mexico and Brazil are warning external actors against interfering
*  in Venezuela's national affairs.
*  Mass protests in support of Maduro took place across Venezuela this weekend.
*  We'll go to Caracas for more later in the broadcast.
*  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has revoked a plea deal for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and
*  two other men held at Guantanamo accused of plotting the 9-11 attacks.
*  Under the deal, the three prisoners had agreed to plead guilty and be sentenced to life in
*  prison.
*  But on Friday, Austin rescinded the deal in a move that will put the death penalty back
*  on the table for the three men.
*  We'll have more on this story later in the program.
*  The Biden administration has announced the U.S. government will pay out more than $2
*  billion to thousands of black farmers and other farmers of color who are discriminated
*  against by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
*  In a statement, President Biden said, quote,
*  And Florida, Georgia and South Carolina are bracing for possible catastrophic flooding
*  from Hurricane Debbie, which is expected to make landfall today in the Florida Big Bend
*  area.
*  Some areas could face up to 30 inches of rain in the coming days.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
