We get an update on the Trump administration's attempt to deport Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, whose case has alarmed immigrant advocates and civil rights groups. Khalil, a legal permanent resident who is married to a U.S. citizen, was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in New York on Saturday and told his green card was being revoked because of his role in Columbia University student protests last year opposed to Israel's war on Gaza. He has since been moved to an ICE jail in Louisiana with little access to legal counsel or to his family, including his pregnant wife. On Tuesday, a federal judge extended an order blocking Khalil's deportation while he considers whether the arrest was unconstitutional. 

"It's been very clear from the beginning that the government's strategy is to cut Khalil off not just from access to the court here in New York, not just from access to his legal team, but from access to his support base," says Ramzi Kassem, part of Khalil's legal team.

*  is Mahmoud Khalil, the recent Columbia University graduate, Palestine activist detained by the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Trump administration last week. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=22.16s)]
*  Khalil, who is a Palestinian green card holder, has finally been able to speak to his lawyers [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=24.479999999999997s)]
*  after a federal judge on Wednesday ordered the Department of Homeland Security to allow [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  him to have private calls with his legal team. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=35.96s)]
*  Prior to this, Khalil had been unable to speak to his lawyers since his arrest on Saturday [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=39.76s)]
*  night, except for a brief call Monday to confirm he'd been transferred to a detention facility [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=43.92s)]
*  in Gina, Louisiana, where he is still being held. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  At a hearing on Wednesday here in New York's Manhattan federal court, U.S. District Judge [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=53.4s)]
*  Jesse Furman, who'd temporarily blocked Khalil's deportation earlier this week, extended his [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=58.72s)]
*  order while he considers whether Khalil's arrest was unconstitutional. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=64.2s)]
*  The government's charging document says the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has determined [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=69.64s)]
*  that Khalil's presence or activities in the United States would have, quote, serious [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=74.62s)]
*  adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States," unquote. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=79.12s)]
*  Outside the courthouse, Khalil's lawyer, Ramzi Qasem, told reporters what's happening [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=84.48s)]
*  to Mahmoud Khalil is shocking and outrageous. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=90.30000000000001s)]
*  It is absolutely unprecedented, the grounds that are being cited by the government for [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  purportedly claiming to revoke his green card and putting him in removal proceedings. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=102.64s)]
*  This is a person who is a lawful permanent resident. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=106.4s)]
*  This is a U.S. person. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  Those grounds are vague. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=110.16s)]
*  They are rarely used. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=112.16s)]
*  And you know, essentially, they are a form of punishment and retaliation for the exercise [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=114.36s)]
*  of free speech. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=120.48s)]
*  The Trump administration's accused Khalil, without evidence, of being a so-called terrorist [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=122.36s)]
*  sympathizer for participating in Palestinian solidarity protests at Columbia University. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=127.8s)]
*  In a social media post, President Trump celebrated Khalil's arrest, saying it was the first [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=135.06s)]
*  of many to come. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=141.58s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Wednesday this is not about free speech. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=144.10000000000002s)]
*  Rubio added, quote, this is about people who don't have a right to be in the United States [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=149.26000000000002s)]
*  to begin with," end quote. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=155.58s)]
*  In her first media interview, Mahmoud Khalil's wife, Noor Abdallah, who is eight months pregnant, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=158.38s)]
*  who is a U.S. citizen, told Reuters she had been naive to think Khalil was safe from arrest [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=165.42s)]
*  as a permanent legal resident. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=170.82s)]
*  She added, no one from Columbia University's administration had contacted her to offer [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=172.4s)]
*  help, although Mahmoud had written to the president of Columbia University a few days [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=178.78s)]
*  before he was arrested expressing concern and fear and asking for some kind of protection. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=184.78s)]
*  He was arrested by ICE agents in his Columbia housing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=191.58s)]
*  For more on Mahmoud Khalil's legal case, we're joined now by his lawyer, Ramzi Qasem, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=196.78s)]
*  professor of law at CUNY, that's the City University of New York, where he founded the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=202.18s)]
*  legal clinic CLEAR. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=206.74s)]
*  The acronym stands for Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=208.54s)]
*  Ramzi, thank you for joining us again. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=213.7s)]
*  You were just in court yesterday. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=215.78s)]
*  Explain what the judge ruled. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=217.82s)]
*  Thank you, Amy. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=220.78s)]
*  Yeah, yesterday was an important day in court. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=223.54s)]
*  As you mentioned, the judge has prohibited the government from deporting Khalil until [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=227.1s)]
*  further order of the court. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=233.82s)]
*  So that's important. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=236.14s)]
*  The judge also agreed with us, the lawyers for Khalil, that it was imperative for the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=237.26s)]
*  government to respond to our motion to bring Khalil back to New York. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=244.42s)]
*  And so the government has to respond to that motion by tomorrow. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=250.02s)]
*  And the government also last night moved to a change venue, meaning that the government [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=254.74s)]
*  believes Khalil's habeas corpus case, the case that he brought in federal court, should [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=259.22s)]
*  not be in federal court in New York, but it should be in federal court in Louisiana. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=264.3s)]
*  And we, you know, that's not really a surprise to us, because of course, it's been very clear [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=269.26s)]
*  from the beginning that the government's strategy is to cut Khalil off, not just from access [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=275.62s)]
*  to the court here in New York, not just from access to his legal team, but from access [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=283.09999999999997s)]
*  to his support base, to his community, to his family, including his expecting wife. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=288.14s)]
*  And that's the only conceivable reason why the government would not have held him in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=293.18s)]
*  New York or New Jersey, as they typically do, and moved him 1,000 miles away, merely [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  hours after he files a lawsuit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=302.7s)]
*  his detention. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=308.14s)]
*  Now, Ronzy Kassim, were you able to speak with Mahmood yesterday after the judge's [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=309.14s)]
*  ruling? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=315.78s)]
*  Yeah, Amy, we were. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=316.78s)]
*  So when we were in court yesterday, we asked the judge to order the government to allow [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=319.38s)]
*  us to have a privileged conversation with our client in Louisiana. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=324.46s)]
*  Since we brought suit on his behalf and filed the motion to have him brought back home to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=328.38s)]
*  New York City, we haven't been able to speak to him. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=332.9s)]
*  One of the lawyers on the team was able to have an unprivileged call, but as most of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=336.78s)]
*  your listeners and watch and viewers know, you know, those calls, the unprivileged calls, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=341.17999999999995s)]
*  the regular calls and visits can be monitored or recorded by the government. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=346.5s)]
*  So the judge ordered the government to allow us to have a privileged conversation. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=350.06s)]
*  We had the first privileged conversation with Mahmood last night. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=354.22s)]
*  And you know, of course, I'm limited in what I can say about that privileged conversation, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=359.14s)]
*  but I can tell you that, thankfully, he is in good spirits. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=363.34s)]
*  He's in fighting spirits. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=366.42s)]
*  He appreciates all the support that he's received. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=368.06s)]
*  The fact that there were thousands of people, certainly hundreds, I would say over a thousand [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=371.82s)]
*  people outside the courthouse yesterday masked to protest in solidarity with him and in [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=376.34s)]
*  solidarity with the Palestinian people. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=381.5s)]
*  The government is trying to deport Mahmood based on a rarely used provision of federal [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=384.14s)]
*  immigration law that allows the secretary of state to remove individuals whose presence, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=389.5s)]
*  it believes, has potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=395.41999999999996s)]
*  States, unquote. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=400.78s)]
*  Can you explain this extremely rare provision? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=402.7s)]
*  The only previous time it was used before was in 1995, according to recent press reports. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=406.14000000000004s)]
*  According to The New York Times, that was an attempt to deport a former Mexican government [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=413.5s)]
*  official. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=417.54s)]
*  Ironically, the judge who struck it down as unconstitutional in 1996 was Mary Ann Trump [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=418.54s)]
*  Barry, President Trump's sister, who was a federal judge in New Jersey. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=426.5s)]
*  Can you talk about this? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=431.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so that provision has an interesting history, to say the least. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=434.66s)]
*  It's a provision that is now understood to have been enacted, primarily to target Eastern [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=440.26000000000005s)]
*  European Jewish Holocaust survivors who came to the United States and were suspected, often [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=447.34000000000003s)]
*  wrongly suspected, of being Soviet agents. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=453.1s)]
*  So that's the origin story of this particular piece of federal legislation. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=456.26000000000005s)]
*  That origin story is the reason why Congress came back in and amended it, saying, well, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=460.62s)]
*  you can't use this law to punish people for their views and their speech, and if you want [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=465.65999999999997s)]
*  to do that, then it requires a personal certification by the secretary of state for why that person's [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=471.74s)]
*  presence and their speech poses a compelling risk to U.S. foreign policy interests. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=481.26s)]
*  And it also requires the secretary of state to notify Congress with supporting evidence [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=488.78000000000003s)]
*  for why they're making this move. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=494.78000000000003s)]
*  So it is an exceedingly rarely used provision, and it certainly does not trump the Constitution [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=496.5s)]
*  and Mr. Khalil's First Amendment rights. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=504.7s)]
*  So what are you calling for now as we wrap up? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=507.22s)]
*  Well, we're calling for what we've always called for and what Mahmoud and his family [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=509.62s)]
*  and his supporters and their supporters have always called for. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=514.5s)]
*  Every day Mahmoud spends in detention, whether it's in Louisiana or elsewhere, is a day too long. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=517.38s)]
*  We want to bring him back to New York. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=521.62s)]
*  We want to bring him back to his family. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=523.14s)]
*  And so we want him moved back here and freed as soon as possible. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=525.1s)]
*  And we're pursuing that through every available avenue, with the support of hundreds of thousands [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=528.94s)]
*  of people. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=535.26s)]
*  This idea that the movement in support of Palestinian lives and dignity, that criticism [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=536.4200000000001s)]
*  of U.S. foreign policy in Palestine and support for Israel is this fringe movement that is [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=542.5s)]
*  driven by foreign actors is a falsehood. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=547.62s)]
*  Of course, there are non-citizens and green card holders like Khalil involved in the movement, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=550.94s)]
*  but this is an American movement. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=555.58s)]
*  And the government is in denial about that, and that's going to backfire, possibly in [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=557.38s)]
*  court, but definitely in the court of public opinion. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=561.62s)]
*  As we wrap up, Ramzi Qasem, you're also an expert on Guantanamo. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTuncZ1iUas&t=564.86s)]
