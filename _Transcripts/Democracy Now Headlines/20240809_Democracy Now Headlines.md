**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBlMnToxCuU)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In Gaza, Israel's launched a new offensive on the southern city of Chanyunas, attacking
*  dozens of sites after warning people to flee, but offering no safe alternative.
*  This is a mother fleeing yet again with her family.
*  We are running from the fire.
*  We are running with our children from fear.
*  Where are you going now?
*  God knows.
*  We are walking now.
*  We need to go to the humanitarian areas, but there is no safe place here in Gaza.
*  It is all destroyed and damaged.
*  In Gaza City, multiple children were among at least 15 Palestinians killed in more Israeli
*  strikes targeting schools.
*  At least 30 others were wounded.
*  Manyahu?
*  Children?
*  Only God can help us.
*  He was playing at Abdel Fattah School.
*  He is an innocent child.
*  They say we are terrorists.
*  Look at what Netanyahu is doing.
*  Look at the Arab world.
*  Only God can help us.
*  Amid the mounting death and destruction, leaders of Qatar, Egypt and the United States have
*  called on Israel and Hamas to return to ceasefire talks.
*  The official death toll in Gaza is nearing 40,000, though the true toll is likely far
*  higher.
*  In election news, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz addressed the United Auto Workers in Wayne,
*  Michigan Thursday, where they appeared alongside UAW President Sean Fain.
*  The UAWs endorsed the Democratic ticket in the November election.
*  This is Kamala Harris.
*  Look, even if you're not a member of a union, you better thank unions.
*  For that five-day work week, you better thank unions for that eight-hour work day.
*  You better thank unions for that vacation time.
*  So I'm here to say thank you to all of you.
*  Thank you to all of you.
*  Thank you to all of you.
*  Thank you to all of you.

*  In Florida, Donald Trump held a rambling hour-long news conference from Mar-a-Lago, where he attacked
*  Harris and made a number of false claims, including that nobody died after the January
*  and that Democrats believe in killing babies.
*  The Democrats are really the radical ones in this because they're allowed to do abortion
*  on the eighth and ninth month and even after birth.
*  Despite these comments, Trump downplayed the issue of abortion in the upcoming election.
*  He also claimed he almost went down in a helicopter ride with former San Francisco Mayor Willie
*  Brown and that Brown said terrible things about Kamala Harris.
*  Willie Brown quickly refuted those lies.
*  He said he did not fly in a helicopter with Trump.
*  Trump also claimed he had the largest rallies, at one point comparing his January 6 stop-the-steal
*  rally to Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream speech and rally on the National Mall.
*  Also on Thursday, Trump agreed to debate Kamala Harris on ABC News September 10th and called
*  for two additional debates.
*  Harris told reporters she was glad her opponent had finally agreed, adding, quote,
*  "'Hope he shows up.'"
*  In other campaign news, Kamala Harris's national security adviser Phil Gordon denied
*  reports that Harris would consider an arms embargo on Israel.
*  The embargo is a key demand of Palestinian rights defenders.
*  We'll have more on this later in the broadcast with the co-chair of the uncommitted national
*  movement, who met with Kamala Harris yesterday.
*  In more election news, the consumer advocate group Public Citizen called out the Federal
*  Election Commission Thursday after the agency announced it will not regulate AI deepfakes
*  in political ads before November.
*  Public Citizen called it a, quote, "'shameful abrogation' of the FEC's responsibilities.'
*  The group pointed to a recent post by ex-owner Elon Musk showing an AI altered image of Kamala
*  Harris.
*  Musk's post was in violation of his company's own rules against posting misinformation without
*  context."
*  In related news, tech giants Microsoft and Palantir announced they're merging their
*  government cloud computing and AI tools to service U.S. military and intelligence agencies.
*  Palantir's clients include ICE—that's Immigration and Customs Enforcement—various
*  departments and the government of Israel.
*  In Texas, Republican Governor Greg Abbott signed an executive order Thursday requiring
*  hospitals to obtain patients' immigration status.
*  Abbott claims the move would help Texas calculate the cost of providing health care to immigrants.
*  Rights groups slammed Texas' latest attack on immigrant communities, which is likely
*  to face legal challenges.
*  The Border Network of Human Rights in El Paso blasted Abbott for, quote, using immigrants
*  as a scapegoat for his failed policies and political frustrations, unquote.
*  Here in New York, a 63-year-old climate activist and musician was arrested Thursday, now faces
*  up to seven years in prison, performing a piece by Bach during a protest outside the
*  headquarters of Citibank.
*  John Mark Rosendahl, a professional cellist, was arrested alongside 14 other peaceful protesters
*  who encircled Rosendahl to shield him from the police while he performed in the public
*  plaza.
*  Rosendahl spoke briefly before he started playing Bach's suites for cello.
*  We're here for freedom of speech.
*  I'm playing music here today because we are taught that the purpose of music is to
*  sober and quiet the mind and make it susceptible to divine influences.
*  His words were interrupted as his fellow activists urged him to start playing as police approached.
*  The protest was part of the Summer of Heat on Wall Street campaign, which has been targeting
*  Citibank with peaceful demonstrations all summer.
*  Some 500 people have been arrested since the action started.
*  Nobel Peace Laureate Mohammed Yunus has been sworn in as head of Bangladesh's caretaker
*  government just days after the ouster of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina following weeks
*  of student-led protests.
*  Yunus, a longtime critic of Hasina, took the oath during a ceremony at the Presidential
*  Palace in the capital Dhaka Thursday evening.
*  Over a dozen other members of Yunus's cabinet were also sworn in, including two students
*  who led the uprising against Hasina, Naheed Islam and Asif Mahmood.
*  Adi-La-Rahman Khan, a prominent Bangladeshi human rights advocate who was sentenced to
*  two years in prison by Hasina's government, will also be an adviser to Yunus's interim
*  government.
*  Mohammed Yunus, known as the Banker of the Poor, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in
*  2006 for his work developing microloans.
*  For more, we'll go to Dhaka after headlines.
*  In Tunisia, President Khayyis Saeed has fired Prime Minister Ahmed Khani, replacing him
*  with Tunisia's social affairs minister just one year after Khani assumed the role.
*  Its latest shakeup by President Saeed in what critics have labeled a constitutional
*  coup and power grab.
*  It comes ahead of Tunisia's October 6 presidential election, where Saeed's top opponents have
*  been jailed or barred from running.
*  Earlier this week, five presidential candidates were sentenced to prison, including Abir Moussi,
*  a prominent Saeed critic who was sentenced to two years on charges she insulted the Election
*  Commission.
*  In Japan, Nagasaki is commemorating 79 years since the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb on the
*  Japanese city, killing an estimated 74,000 people just days after the U.S. killed 140,000
*  people when it dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima.
*  This is Nagasaki Mayor Shiro Suzuki.
*  This year's ceremony was marked by a diplomatic row after Nagasaki's mayor declined to invite
*  the Israeli ambassador.
*  In protest, the U.S. ambassador Rahm Emanuel and other Western envoys boycotted the ceremony.
*  In Thailand, the recently disbanded Move Forward Opposition Party has regrouped and announced
*  it's now operating as the People's Party.
*  Without a doubt, we must win the 2027 election.
*  In the next election, our goal is not just to be the leading party like in the 2023 election,
*  but to win and form a single-party government.
*  The term people in our party's name is not just a name.
*  According to our slogan, By the People, For the People, we aim to create a country where
*  ultimate power truly belongs to the people.
*  The anti-establishment Youth-led Move Forward Party won the most seats last year in the
*  election but was blocked from taking power.
*  Catalonia's parliament Thursday confirmed socialist Salvador Illa as head of Catalonia's
*  new government, ending more than a decade of rule by the separatist movement.
*  Illa is an ally of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
*  His election was said to be upstaged by the surprise vanishing of the Catalan separatist
*  leader Carlos Puigdemont after he spoke at a rally in Barcelona Thursday, then evaded
*  arrest by fleeing to Belgium.
*  Spanish authorities are demanding explanations from police about how Puigdemont was able
*  to return to Catalonia and then go into exile again.
*  In Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro has blocked access to the ex-social media platform
*  for 10 days amidst rising tensions over the disputed results of last month's presidential
*  election.
*  Maduro accused his rivals of weaponizing the platform against him and accused ex-owner
*  Elon Musk of spreading hate.
*  In other developments, Venezuela's Supreme Court found opposition candidate Edmundo González,
*  who claims he won the election, to be in contempt of court after he ignored a court summons
*  mandating his presence for an audit of the election.
*  This comes as Venezuela's top prosecutor is launching a criminal probe into González
*  and fellow opposition leader María Carina Machado after the pair called on the military
*  to abandon its support for Maduro and stop cracking down on protesters.
*  Meanwhile, Chile's president, Gabriel Boric, said he, quote, does not recognize Maduro's
*  self-proclaimed victory.
*  Back in the U.S., Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has called on Sangamon County Sheriff
*  Jack Campbell to resign over mishandling the fatal July shooting of Sonia Massey, a 36-year-old
*  black woman.
*  One of Campbell's deputies shot Massey in her own kitchen after she called 911 for help.
*  Sean Grayson, who is white, has been charged with first-degree murder.
*  This comes as newly released records show several emergency calls were made from Massey's
*  home regarding her mental health in the days leading up to the fatal shooting.
*  In one call to 911, Massey's mother, Donna Massey, reported her daughter was having a
*  mental breakdown.
*  Donna Massey goes on to tell the dispatcher, quote, I don't want you guys to hurt her,
*  and said she feared a police officer whose prejudice would be sent to her daughter's
*  home.
*  And today marks 10 years since the police killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson,
*  Missouri.
*  His death sparked an uprising led by the Black Lives Matter movement in Ferguson and across
*  the country.
*  Brown had graduated high school just eight days before his killing.
*  Brown's mother, Leslie McSpadden, was interviewed recently by GMA3, where she said she's still
*  seeking justice for her son.
*  This is part of that interview.
*  How would you like for your son, your baby, to be remembered?
*  As a great big brother, all of his siblings love him.
*  He would have been a great contribution to this world had his time not been cut short.
*  Michael Brown was killed by white police officer Darren Wilson, but a grand jury and a federal
*  investigation cleared Wilson.
*  St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell, who just defeated Congressmember Cory Bush in
*  primary, also refused in 2020 to press criminal charges against Darren Wilson.
*  Today, the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Foundation is set to present Brown's case
*  before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on behalf of Brown's mother.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
