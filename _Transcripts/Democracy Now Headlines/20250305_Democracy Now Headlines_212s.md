As stiff new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China took effect on Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned that Trump's moves are aimed at "a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us." Canada relies on the U.S. for 75% of exports and a third of its imports. For more, we speak with a senior researcher at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, Hadrian Mertins-Kirkwood. "If there's one feeling in Canada right now, it's probably betrayal. We trusted this relationship with the U.S. for a century. We count on the U.S. as an economic partner. We're obviously very closely culturally tied. And this just kind of throws everything into question," says Mertins-Kirkwood.

# "Betrayal": Canadian Researcher Responds to Trump's Tariffs & Trade War Amid Fears of Recession
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY)
*  Democracy depends on a free press. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=0.0s)]
*  Please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=2.4s)]
*  A major focus of President Trump's address Tuesday night was tariffs. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=6.24s)]
*  After imposing stiff new tariffs on America's three largest trading partners, Mexico, Canada [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=11.72s)]
*  and China, early on Tuesday, President Trump doubled down on his decision during his speech. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  They're about protecting the soul of our country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=23.28s)]
*  Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again, and it's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=29.16s)]
*  happening, and it will happen rather quickly. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=33.84s)]
*  There will be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=35.84s)]
*  It won't be much. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=40.88s)]
*  No you're not. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=42.76s)]
*  Oh. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=43.76s)]
*  For more on the tariffs, we're joined from Ottawa, Canada, by Hadrien Martins Kirkwood, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=44.76s)]
*  senior researcher at Canadian Center for Policy Alternatives, his most recent piece, 10 Trump-Proof [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=49.28s)]
*  Nation Building Projects for a Strong Independent Canada. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=54.08s)]
*  Hadrien, we only have a minute, but if you can respond to what President Trump has done [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=58.48s)]
*  and of course your prime minister, Trudeau, held a news conference saying, then we're [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=63.16s)]
*  going to have to retaliate and apologize to the American people for doing this, saying [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=67.48s)]
*  he understood it's the president, not the people. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=71.56s)]
*  Well, I mean, if there's one feeling in Canada right now, it's probably betrayal. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=74.68s)]
*  We trusted this relationship with the U.S. for a century. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=80.24s)]
*  We count on the U.S. as an economic partner. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=83.96s)]
*  We're obviously very closely culturally tied, and this just kind of throws everything into [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=86.0s)]
*  question. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=90.0s)]
*  How are we supposed to negotiate with a partner like this that tears up the trade agreement [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=91.0s)]
*  we have, that keeps moving the goalpost in terms of what Canada is supposed to do? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=94.89999999999999s)]
*  It's just a really untenable situation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=99.36s)]
*  And Hadrien, what do you think will be the impact? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=103.8s)]
*  Because especially in the Midwest, the Midwest depends a lot for its oil and even energy [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=106.88s)]
*  in some places from Canada. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=112.52s)]
*  Yeah, so we see this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=114.44s)]
*  I mean, this is going to hit both sides of the border really hard. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=117.12s)]
*  There's no winner in a trade war. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=119.6s)]
*  Households are going to see costs grow up by a couple thousand dollars a year. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=121.56s)]
*  I've seen different estimates. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=124.4s)]
*  But there's also thousands, maybe tens or even hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=126.36s)]
*  That's going to hit, again, hit both sides of the border due to this trade war. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=131.04s)]
*  It's going to hit Canada more proportionately just because of the size of our economy. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=134.16s)]
*  So Canada almost certainly will go into recession immediately because of these tariffs. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  And Hadrien, what do you think will turn this around? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=143.08s)]
*  And what is the response overall of the Canadian people? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=147.84s)]
*  Right now, we're seeing from our federal government, they're treating this like an [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  ordinary trade dispute. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=156.68s)]
*  They put tariffs on us, we'll put tariffs on them. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=158.34s)]
*  I'm not sure that's sufficient. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  And we're seeing some leaders in Canada talk about more ambitious measures, things [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=161.8s)]
*  like reducing the exports of electricity and critical minerals to the U.S., putting limits [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  on procurement contracts, not allowing U.S. firms to do business here in different ways, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=169.72s)]
*  pulling U.S. liquor off the shelves in some provinces. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=175.2s)]
*  So there's all sorts of measures on the table. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=178.12s)]
*  If there's one silver lining to this whole situation, it's that Canada seems to be [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=180.2s)]
*  more unified than ever across the political spectrum, that we need to really be disentangling [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=184.04s)]
*  ourselves from the U.S. economically. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=188.78s)]
*  Hadrien Martins Kirkwood, thanks so much for being with us. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=191.28s)]
*  Senior researcher at the Canadian Center for Policy Alternatives, speaking to us from Ottawa. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=194.12s)]
*  We'll link to your piece 10 Trump-proof nation-building projects for a strong, independent [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=198.88s)]
*  Canada. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DJ_XR7pnY&t=203.6s)]
