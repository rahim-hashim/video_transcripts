# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” February 23, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [February 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWkFUraBL1k)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees, UNRWA, warns that it has reached a breaking
*  point, amidst the U.S. and other countries halting funding and repeated Israeli attempts
*  to dismantle the life-sustaining organization.
*  In a letter to the president of the U.N. General Assembly, UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini said,
*  quote, I fear we're on the edge of a monumental disaster.
*  He also noted, quote, there have been more children, more journalists, more medical personnel
*  and more U.N. staff killed than anywhere in the world during a conflict, unquote.
*  This comes as Israeli attacks throughout the Gaza Strip continue.
*  At least 40 people were killed after coming under Israeli shelling on residential homes
*  in Der Abalah in central Gaza.
*  Survivors gathered outside Al Aqsa Hospital to mourn their loved ones who perished in
*  the attack, including this father of a baby born just two weeks into Israel's assault.
*  The missile came down and killed 10 of us, and the whole house got destroyed.
*  My mother is in intensive care.
*  May God be kind to us.
*  Thank God.
*  Thank God, my child.
*  The child was born during the war, day 13 in the war.
*  Meanwhile, Israeli negotiators are taking part in truce talks in Paris, according to
*  local media.
*  At the U.N. Security Council, the head of Doctors Without Borders blasted the U.S. for
*  its repeated vetoes of Gaza ceasefire resolutions.
*  MSF Secretary General Christopher Lockyer addressed the 15-member U.N. body Thursday.
*  Children who do survive this war will not only bear the visible wounds of traumatic
*  injuries, but the invisible ones, too.
*  Those of repeated displacement, constant fear and witnessing family members literally
*  dismembered before their eyes.
*  These psychological injuries have led children as young as five to tell us that they would
*  prefer to die.
*  The people of Gaza need a ceasefire not when practicable, but now.
*  They need a sustained ceasefire, not a temporary period of calm.
*  President Joe Biden said on social media Thursday, quote, the overwhelming majority of Palestinians
*  are not Hamas, and Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people, unquote.
*  Biden did not, however, comment on his refusal to call for a permanent ceasefire, ongoing
*  U.S. funding for the Israeli military, or his administration's pending congressional
*  request for another $14 billion to fund Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  In a major victory for the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement, Norway's pension
*  has divested their entire Israel bond holdings.
*  Four Norwegian universities have also decided to cut ties with Israeli institutions linked
*  to the IDF.
*  In the U.S., the student government of the University of California Davis voted to divest
*  its $20 million budget from, quote, companies complicit in the occupation and genocide,
*  unquote.
*  They cited companies like McDonald's, Sabra, Starbucks, Airbnb, Disney and Chevron.
*  Here in New York, thousands of protesters led by the group Jewish Voice for Peace marched
*  from the United Nations to the offices of AIPAC.
*  That's the American Israel Public Affairs Committee Thursday.
*  The activists also took aim at elected leaders who've received hundreds of thousands of
*  dollars from AIPAC, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, New York Senator
*  Kirsten Gillibrand and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
*  This is anti-war protester Patrick Brent.
*  I'm here today as not only as an American Jew, but as a combat veteran who is now an
*  anti-war activist, among other things, to speak out against AIPAC and a larger scope
*  Zionism and how it misrepresents Judaism.
*  And my demand is for U.S. politicians to cut ties with AIPAC and to get more serious
*  about what their contingents say than what AIPAC has to say as far as demanding a ceasefire,
*  an immediate ceasefire, a permanent ceasefire as a beginning toward a liberated Palestine.
*  The mother of deceased Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny says she was finally
*  able to see her son's body.
*  Russian authorities, who ruled Navalny died of natural causes, had prevented her from
*  seeing him for nearly a week following his death.
*  Lyudmila Navalnaya says authorities are now attempting to blackmail her into holding a
*  secret burial away from public view.
*  She posted this video on YouTube.
*  I'm recording this video because they started threatening me, looking me in the eye.
*  The investigators say that if I don't agree to a secret funeral, they will do something
*  with my son's body.
*  The investigator, Voropayev, openly told me, Time is not working for you.
*  Corpse is decomposed.
*  I don't want special conditions.
*  I just want everything to be done according to the law.
*  I demand receiving my son's body immediately.
*  Meanwhile, President Biden met with Alexei Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, and his
*  daughter, Dasha Navalnaya, a student at Stanford University in California Thursday.
*  The U.S. has announced more than 500 new sanctions against Russia today.
*  On Wednesday, Biden reportedly called Putin a, quote, crazy SOB while at a San Francisco
*  fundraiser.
*  The Kremlin has accused Western leaders of hysteria around Navalny's death.
*  The U.N. human rights chief warned there is no end in sight to the war in Ukraine nearly
*  two years after Russia invaded on February 24th, 2022.
*  The U.N. said over 14 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes in the past
*  two years.
*  About a third of those have since returned home.
*  The U.N. says it's confirmed over 10,000 civilian deaths, though the true toll is likely
*  much higher.
*  Ukraine is upping pressure on the U.S. and other allies to supply more funding and arms
*  after Russia captured the eastern city of Avdivka last week.
*  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba offered an ominous take on the current state of the
*  war at the Munich Security Conference.
*  The era of peace in Europe is over.
*  And every time Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from a Ukrainian town because of the lack
*  of ammunition, think of it not only in terms of defending democracy and world-based order,
*  but also in terms of Russia getting, Russian soldiers getting few kilometers closer to
*  your towns.
*  New York Judge Arthur Nguyen denied Donald Trump's request to delay payment of the
*  $455 million he was ordered to pay last week for illegally inflating the value of his business
*  assets.
*  Trump had requested a month-long delay before the civil fraud penalty is enforced, but the
*  The judge noted Trump's lawyers, quote, failed to explain, much less justify, any
*  basis for a stay, unquote.
*  Trump will now have 30 days to post-bond and appeal the ruling.
*  Earlier this week, New York Attorney General Letitia James said she's prepared to seize
*  Trump's New York properties if he fails to come up with the money.
*  In reproductive rights news, a third Alabama fertility clinic has halted its in vitro fertilization
*  the wake of this week's Alabama Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos are children.
*  The decision, which has been met with outrage from families, legal groups and medical providers,
*  opens doctors and patients to possible wrongful death lawsuits.
*  Biden's campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, said, quote, what's happening in Alabama
*  right now is only possible because Donald Trump's Supreme Court justices overturned
*  Roe v. Wade, she said.
*  In India, protesting farmers are observing a black day today following the recent death
*  of a young farmer after police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse demonstrations.
*  Farmer unions are calling on all Indians to hang black flags from their homes and cars
*  to express their anger in solidarity with the farm workers who have been marching toward
*  New Delhi to demand fair prices for their crops.
*  Protesters vow to continue.
*  If we don't get the minimum support price, then we might die here facing bullets or we'll
*  die back home due to poverty.
*  So it is better that we stay here fighting for our rights.
*  Earlier this week, the social media platform X admitted it took down a number of accounts
*  and posts related to the farm worker movement following an order by the Indian government.
*  Senegalese President Macky Saul said Thursday he'll leave office April 2nd at the end of
*  his presidential term.
*  This comes after he attempted to delay this month's election by 10 months, plunging
*  Senegal into political turmoil and triggering accusations he was trying to hold on to power.
*  Senegal's highest election authority issued a ruling the poll delay was unlawful, which
*  Saul vowed to abide by.
*  I consider having finished my work at the head of the country at the end of my term.
*  It is up to all these components of the dialogue and to the Constitutional Council in the last
*  resort to see how they will continue the process.
*  But what is certain, there will not be a vacuum.
*  We cannot leave a country without a president.
*  That's obvious.
*  President Saul did not, however, announce a date for a new election in Senegal.
*  Talks between civil society groups, political parties and candidates are scheduled to take
*  place next week.
*  In Kenya, the Ogeek indigenous people are fighting their ongoing eviction from their
*  ancestral Mao forest.
*  Kenya human rights advocates have taken legal action to block further evictions and accuse
*  Kenyan authorities of serious violations.
*  In at least the past decade, over 100,000 people have been evicted.
*  Many have scattered across the forest area, living in makeshift structures made of nylon
*  bags as the government refuses to provide alternative housing.
*  Community members have also recently led protests in Nairobi as they petitioned for their right
*  to inhabit the forest.
*  Many of the community people might even die because they depend on this food.
*  They don't have any alternative.
*  Also there are people, forest dwellers, they don't know to stay at town, at market places.
*  That's why you find those elderly people are staying inside the forest and they are
*  saying unless they come and kill us inside here, we will go out because this is our land.
*  And human rights groups are warning the government of Panama is not prepared to help transfer
*  some 1,300 members of the indigenous community from their homes on a small Caribbean island
*  that's disappearing due to rising sea levels.
*  Garde Siub is off Panama's northern coast and has faced some of the worst impacts of
*  climate change.
*  Indigenous people on the island have requested support from the Panamanian government since
*  at least 2010 and are scheduled to move to a relocation site on mainland Panama by the
*  end of the month.
*  Human Rights Watch says the Panamanian government is yet to make clean water, sanitation services
*  or health care available at the relocation site.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
