*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad have submitted a formal response to a United Nations
*  ceasefire proposal for the Gaza Strip.
*  A Hamas spokesperson said the group's priority is to bring a complete stop to Israel's
*  assault on Gaza.
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to respond publicly to the U.S.-backed
*  ceasefire resolution, which was approved by the U.N. General Assembly Monday.
*  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday Netanyahu had, quote, reaffirmed his
*  commitment to the proposal, unquote.
*  This comes as Israel continues its unrelenting assault on the Gaza Strip.
*  Among the latest attacks was an airstrike on a home in Gaza City's Zaitoun neighborhood
*  that killed at least six people.
*  In Jordan, world leaders and top aid officials gathered Tuesday for an emergency humanitarian
*  summit on Gaza.
*  They were joined by U.N. Secretary General António Guterres.
*  Your Excellencies, the horror must stop.
*  It's high time for a ceasefire, along with the unconditional release of hostages.
*  I welcome the peace initiative recently outlined by President Biden and urge all parties to
*  seize this opportunity and come to an agreement.
*  A new report by a U.N. independent human rights body finds both Israel and Palestinian armed
*  groups have committed war crimes since Hamas' surprise attack on October 7th.
*  The damning U.N. report accuses Israel of using starvation as a method of warfare, forcible
*  transfer and intentionally directing attacks against civilians.
*  It calls on Israeli leaders to immediately end attacks resulting in the killing and maiming
*  of civilians in Gaza.
*  End the siege, implement a ceasefire and to pay reparations.
*  The report also calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held
*  by Hamas.
*  On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin congratulated Israel's military chief over
*  Saturday's raid on Nusayrat refugee camp, which freed four Israeli hostages.
*  His call to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant came as the United Nations' top human
*  rights office said Israel likely committed war crimes during the operation, which killed
*  at least 274 Palestinians.
*  Sixty-four children were among the dead, nearly 700 others were wounded.
*  Jeremy Lawrence, spokesperson for the Office of the United Nations' High Commissioner
*  for Human Rights, said Israel's actions had left human rights workers deeply shocked.
*  Jeremy Lawrence, spokesperson for the Office of the United Nations' High Commissioner
*  for Human Rights, said Israel's actions had left human rights workers deeply shocked.
*  Hundreds of Palestinians, many of them civilians, were reportedly killed and injured.
*  The principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution, as set out under the laws
*  of war, were respected by the Israeli forces.
*  Israel's military says it killed a senior commander of Hezbollah during an assault on
*  southern Lebanon Tuesday.
*  Talib Abdullah is among the most senior Hezbollah officials killed since cross-border fighting
*  between Israel and Hezbollah escalated eight months ago.
*  Meanwhile, in the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces killed six Palestinians during a military
*  raid on the town of Qatirdan.
*  Among those killed was the brother of a 12-year-old child, who was killed by Israeli forces in
*  Jenin two years ago.
*  In Washington, D.C., peace activists with code pink disrupted a public address Tuesday
*  by National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.
*  He was speaking at the American Jewish Committee's Global Forum in Washington, D.C.
*  Code pink activists Olivia D'Nucci and media media Medea Benjamin were quickly removed
*  from the venue.
*  Their protests came a day after officers with the Federal Protective Service fired a salvo
*  of pepperball rounds to clear demonstrators who directed a tent encampment outside a San
*  Francisco federal building to protest U.S. support for Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  Elsewhere yesterday, President Joe Biden was interrupted by a protester who accused him
*  of being complicit in genocide.
*  The main reason I'm here is to say, I mean this from the bottom of my heart.
*  Stop being genocidal.
*  Stop being genocidal.
*  That's just what I am.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  President Biden was speaking at a Washington, D.C. conference hosted by every town for gun
*  safety.
*  As the protester was led away, the crowd chanted, Four more years.
*  Folks, it's okay.
*  Look, they care.
*  Innocent children have been lost.
*  They make a full point.
*  The protest during President Biden's remarks on gun violence came just hours after a jury
*  in Wilmington, Delaware found his son, Hunter Biden, guilty of three felony charges for
*  illegally purchasing a gun at a time when he was using drugs.
*  Hunter Biden becomes the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be found guilty
*  of a crime.
*  Special counsel David Weiss spoke after the verdict.
*  This case was about the illegal choices defendant made while in the throes of addiction, his
*  choice to lie on a government forum when he bought a gun and the choice to then possess
*  that gun.
*  It was these choices and the combination of guns and drugs that made his conduct dangerous.
*  Second, no one in this country is above the law.
*  Everyone must be accountable for their actions, even this defendant.
*  A date for a sentencing hearing has not been set.
*  Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though a strict sentence is unlikely, and
*  Biden could avoid jail entirely.
*  In the Gulf of Aden, at least 49 people have drowned and 140 others are missing after a
*  boat carrying African asylum seekers sank off the coast of Yemen.
*  At least six children are among the dead.
*  The refugees had been fleeing violence, poverty and the impacts of climate change in the horn
*  of Africa.
*  The U.N.'s International Organization for Migration reports nearly 100,000 asylum seekers
*  arrived in Yemen last year, many of them bound for Saudi Arabia and other wealthier nations.
*  That's more than triple the number who made the perilous crossing just two years prior.
*  Malawi's vice president and nine members of his entourage have been confirmed dead
*  after their plane crashed in a mountainous region of the Southern African nation.
*  Salos Chalima had served as Malawi's vice president since 2020, was expected to challenge
*  incumbent President Lazarus Chakwera in elections scheduled for next year.
*  The Biden administration has lifted a ban on armed shipments to the Ukrainian military
*  unit known as the Azov Brigade, a former militia with ties to far-right hate groups.
*  The State Department said Tuesday a thorough review turned up no evidence the brigade's
*  members have committed human rights abuses.
*  The Azov Brigade was founded in 2014 by a self-avowed neo-Nazi and white supremacist.
*  Meanwhile, delegates from 90 nations are set to gather in Switzerland this weekend for
*  a Ukraine peace summit, though Russia and key nations, including China, will not be
*  participating.
*  Swiss President Viola Amherd on Monday outlined the summit's goals.
*  We want to discuss ways for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine based on
*  international law and the U.N. Charter.
*  We want to develop a common understanding for a possible framework to reach this goal.
*  And we want to decide on a scheduled together, how both parties can be tied into a future
*  peace process.
*  The pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has agreed to pay $700 million to settle lawsuits
*  brought by more than 40 state attorneys general over its asbestos-laced talcum powder, which
*  has been linked to cancer.
*  As part of the settlement, J&J will permanently end the production, sale and marketing of
*  all products containing talcum powder.
*  In 2018, a Reuters investigation found the pharmaceutical giant knew as early as 1971
*  talcum powder contained dangerous levels of asbestos, but covered up its findings about
*  the deadly carcinogen.
*  And a federal judge in Tallahassee has struck down Florida's ban on gender-affirming care
*  for minors, ruling the law unconstitutional.
*  U.S. District Judge Robert Henkel also struck down a provision that erects barriers to adults
*  seeking transition care.
*  In a 105-page order handed down Tuesday, the judge writes, quote,
*  In time, discrimination against transgender individuals will diminish, just as racism
*  and misogyny have diminished.
*  To paraphrase a civil rights advocate from an earlier time, the arc of the moral universe
*  is long, but it bends toward justice, he wrote.
*  The legislation was signed by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis last year.
*  DeSantis has promised to appeal the ruling.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
