Amid ongoing chaos and outrage stemming from the Trump administration's gutting of the U.S. Agency for International Development, we hear a critique of USAID and the "humanitarian-industrial complex" from South African anthropologist Kathryn Mathers. "USAID is very much a part of a system and industry that not only depends on global inequality … but in many ways produces it," she says. Funding for foreign assistance, much of which actually flows back to the United States, ultimately "does its job of supporting U.S. interests" and "renders the causes of global inequality invisible, hiding the ways that often U.S. policies, U.S. trade agreements and other forms of extractive capitalism are often the causes." Mathers emphasizes, however, that Trump's abrupt cuts to the agency, rather than resolving the "paradox" of humanitarian aid, are "doing only harm."

# U.S. Humanitarianism Often Reproduces Inequality, But Killing USAID Is Wrong Answer: Kathryn Mathers

*  Professor Mathers is a co-producer of the forthcoming documentary When I Say Africa. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=57.4s)]
*  Professor Mathers, welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=63.28s)]
*  As you look at what's happening at USAID, the complete dismantling of this agency, can [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=66.1s)]
*  you share your critique of the agency, but what you think must be done? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=73.02s)]
*  Yes, I reference Teju Cole's framing of the humanitarian industrial complex, because I [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=80.72s)]
*  think USAID is very much part of a system, an industry, that not only depends on global [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=89.08s)]
*  inequality, global suffering, but in many ways produces it, reproduces it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=96.72s)]
*  So I have for a long time critiqued the system and these structures, because I do think they [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=102.8s)]
*  do often more harm than the good that they are trying to or claiming to do. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=108.84s)]
*  I think that this is a complex that renders the causes of global inequality invisible, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=117.0s)]
*  hiding the ways that often U.S. policies, U.S. trade agreements and other forms of sort [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=128.32s)]
*  of extractive capitalism, are often the causes of these crises, these challenges that people [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=137.3s)]
*  around the world have, that then aid steps in to help or to solve. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=148.70000000000002s)]
*  But in fact, it's not solving it at all, because it's making sure that we never ever ask the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=154.26000000000002s)]
*  questions, why is it that the United States has the resources, has the power to help in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=158.06s)]
*  this way, while other people are often suffering in ways that are caused by the U.S.'s own [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=165.74s)]
*  policies? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=174.26000000000002s)]
*  And it's that sort of paradox that I was trying to grapple with, because of course, suddenly [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=175.5s)]
*  taking away what are in fact necessary, as we just heard earlier in the show, necessary [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=182.02s)]
*  programs that help people who need help is certainly just a bull in a china shop and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=188.74s)]
*  doing, again, only harm. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=199.74s)]
*  So it is, for me, a complicated paradox, because if I argued for any kind of changes, it would [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=203.78s)]
*  that a country like the U.S. should be offering reparations for the climate damage that they've [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=212.1s)]
*  done in the global South, in the interest of their own economies, in the interest of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=219.14s)]
*  their own lifestyle. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=222.94s)]
*  And certainly, one would like to see a sort of thoughtful set of plans and questions around [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  what is it that a country like the U.S. is doing to produce this kind of inequality, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=237.66s)]
*  to produce or reproduce the inability of countries like South Africa, for example, in making [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=243.66s)]
*  its own HIV medication and providing it to its people. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=253.38s)]
*  And so, there is this danger, I think, of—produced by the humanitarian industrial complex that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=259.18s)]
*  allows people to go, well, we're doing the right thing, we're doing a good thing, but [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=267.54s)]
*  allows them to feel okay about their implication, their participation in a system that in fact [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=272.94s)]
*  helps to produce and reproduce that poverty or that inequality. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=281.08s)]
*  You've worked with USAID-funded projects and adult literacy and voter education in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=285.14000000000004s)]
*  South Africa. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=290.74s)]
*  And you write that the work was largely dependent on Western donor funding, but, quote, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=292.26000000000005s)]
*  "'It always came with strings, especially the money from USAID.'" [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=297.22s)]
*  What kind of strings are you talking about? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=302.26000000000005s)]
*  How do you think USAID's goal is ultimately about supporting the U.S. economy? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=305.18s)]
*  And that's a really interesting point. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=311.5s)]
*  I think people may not realize, for example, that millions and millions of dollars go to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=313.62s)]
*  peanut farmers in the United States to provide a substance that goes to babies and children [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=318.42s)]
*  to fight malnutrition. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=326.02000000000004s)]
*  But the money doesn't go to those other countries. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=328.38s)]
*  It goes directly to the farmers in the U.S. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=331.02000000000004s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=334.38s)]
*  And certainly USAID does not make any—is not deluded about this. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=335.62s)]
*  It works in the interest of the United States and of the U.S. economy and of its own sort [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=343.73999999999995s)]
*  of sense of self in the world, at least before this month. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=349.46s)]
*  But a large amount of its budget, small as it is, in fact, as you just described, goes [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=356.29999999999995s)]
*  back to U.S. industries, to U.S. farmers, to U.S. manufacturers. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=365.34s)]
*  Even with a small project like ours, which is not buying anything, so we get to use that—we [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=370.54s)]
*  got to use that money on our programming, a large amount of it goes to the auditors [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=379.66s)]
*  in D.C., for example. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=386.42s)]
*  So it is a sort of cycle of, you know, we're giving you money for this, but much of it [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=387.86s)]
*  ends up coming back to the U.S. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=394.02000000000004s)]
*  So in fact, it does its job of supporting sort of U.S. interest to a large degree. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=396.06s)]
*  The other sort of set of strings, in a way, was that it was never really possible for [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=402.06s)]
*  an organization like us to just do our work. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=409.26s)]
*  Project Literacy had a sustainable working structure that was doing really good adult [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=413.7s)]
*  basic education, literacy, numeracy, financial education. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=423.54s)]
*  But to just get funding from an agency like USAID—and it's certainly not unique in [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=428.78000000000003s)]
*  this way—was almost impossible. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=434.46000000000004s)]
*  Give us funding to do the work we already do. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=438.02000000000004s)]
*  We can prove we do it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=440.04s)]
*  It's really successful. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=441.68s)]
*  And so every six months, you're writing funding proposals that are bending our work into the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=443.14000000000004s)]
*  current sexy language about what matters in aid or development. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=452.9s)]
*  And what matters in aid or development is decided in D.C., in New York, in London, in [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=459.9s)]
*  Geneva. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  It's not decided on the ground where people are doing the work. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=466.21999999999997s)]
*  And there's this reluctance to support that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=470.3s)]
*  I wanted to ask you, Professor Mathers, about the history of critiquing USAID in many parts [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=472.53999999999996s)]
*  of the world. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=477.7s)]
*  And it's been used, for example, as a front for the CIA. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=479.28s)]
*  I'd like to mention a couple of examples from Latin America. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=482.56s)]
*  Back in 2010, USAID covertly funded a Twitter-like social media platform in Cuba to spark a Cuban [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=485.44s)]
*  spring with the hope of bringing down the government. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=491.52s)]
*  And you also have, for example, Peter Kornblum of the National Security Archives saying, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=495.32s)]
*  Among the most infamous examples of USAID funding was the Office of Public Safety, a [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=501.6s)]
*  USAID police training program in the Southern Cone that also trained torturers. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=506.96s)]
*  We only have 20 seconds. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=511.32s)]
*  It's not your total focus, but your thoughts on how it's been used. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=512.88s)]
*  I mean, I don't have doubt that it's been used that way. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=517.48s)]
*  I have no evidence of that. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=521.92s)]
*  It's certainly in the conversation in South Africa, for example, people would make those [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=523.96s)]
*  accusations and be frustrated about that. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=529.9399999999999s)]
*  But I'm more interested in the way that this kind of agency shuts down South Africa's [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=533.66s)]
*  ability to solve its own problems and doesn't support that ability. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=538.06s)]
*  I think that is key, and we're going to link to the articles you write, Professor [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=541.06s)]
*  Catherine Mathers, at Duke University. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=544.18s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=546.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=547.4599999999999s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewWBd7k_xQ&t=548.4599999999999s)]
