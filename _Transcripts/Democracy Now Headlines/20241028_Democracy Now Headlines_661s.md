**Democracy Now Headlines:** [October 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5am56FB2K0)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged for a return to diplomacy and, quote,
*  maximum efforts to prevent an all-out regional war.
*  After Israel bombed Iranian military facilities and air defense systems Saturday, the strikes
*  included a site linked to Iran's ballistic missile program.
*  Iran said four soldiers were killed.
*  Israel also struck air defense batteries and radars in Syria and Iraq.
*  Iranian President Massoud Pesachian said Iran would take an appropriate response to the
*  attack, but he reiterated Iran does not seek a wider war.
*  Israel's attack came about four weeks after Iran launched a missile attack on Israeli
*  military sites in response to Israel's mounting assault on Lebanon and Israel's assassination
*  of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.
*  The Hamas leader they killed in Tehran on the inauguration day of the Iranian president.
*  As the death toll from Israel's 24-day siege on northern Gaza tops 1,000 Palestinians,
*  mostly women and children, the U.N.'s top humanitarian official is warning, quote, the
*  entire population of north Gaza is at risk of dying, unquote.
*  At Kamal Adwan Hospital, Israeli soldiers arrested and expelled nearly all male doctors
*  and staff following its brutal raid.
*  One of the victims of the raid was the hospital's director, Dr. Hassan Abu Safiha's young
*  son Ibrahim.
*  On Saturday, Dr. Abu Safiha led prayers for his murdered child as he laid him to rest.
*  A nurse who survived the Israeli attack on Kamal Adwan described the siege.
*  ABU SAFIHA, Nurse, Hamas Hospital We were all surrounded from all sides.
*  There was shooting from all directions, with bombs and mortars, and they evacuated all
*  those who were sheltering here, so that everyone leaves, both men and women.
*  They separated men from women and made two queues.
*  It was very, very humiliating for our men, since they took them without clothes and nothing
*  to cover with.
*  ELSA RUZ, Hamas Hospital Director, Hamas Hospital Elsewhere in Gaza, an employee of Doctors
*  Without Borders was killed in Khan Yunus, and at least three more journalists were killed
*  in an Israeli airstrike.
*  They were identified as Syed Radwan of Al-Aqsa TV, Hamza Abu Salmiya from Sanad News, and
*  Hanin Mahmoud Baroud from the Al-Quds Foundation.
*  Meanwhile, lawyers at the U.S. Justice Department called on Attorney General Merrick Arlen to
*  launch investigations into crimes against U.S. citizens committed by Israeli soldiers
*  and the occupied West Bank, including the killing of the activist Aishinor Aigee.
*  The letter to Garland highlighted the hypocrisy and the department's refusal to acknowledge
*  crimes by Israel while it's been outspoken against Russia's actions in Ukraine.
*  Israeli strikes in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre have killed at least seven people
*  today.
*  The Israeli military issued evacuation orders for large areas of Tyre as it continues its
*  deadly attacks.
*  Meanwhile, Lebanon's health minister says Israeli strikes have targeted 55 hospitals
*  in Lebanon as Israel seeks to impair the country's health infrastructure.
*  Here in the United States, Microsoft has fired two workers who organized a vigil for Gaza.
*  The employees, who are both Arab, belong to the protest group No Azur for Apartheid, which
*  opposes Microsoft's sale of its cloud technology to Israel.
*  Meanwhile, Harvard University has temporarily suspended dozens of students and professors
*  from its libraries after they staged a series of silent study-in protests to bring attention
*  to genocide in Gaza, as well as the crackdown on free speech at Harvard.
*  Here in New York, Donald Trump headlined a major campaign rally at Madison Square Garden
*  Sunday, holding what The New York Times described as a closing carnival of grievances, misogyny
*  and racism.
*  During his speech, Trump described Democrats as the quote, enemy from within, and repeatedly
*  attacked immigrants, claiming the United States is now a quote, occupied country.
*  Other speakers included Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, Elon Musk, Robert F. Kennedy,
*  and Stephen Miller and Hulk Hogan.
*  The rally began with the conservative comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who called Puerto Rico an
*  island of garbage.
*  There's a lot going on.
*  Like, I don't know if you guys know this, but there's literally a floating island
*  of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's called Puerto Rico.
*  Puerto Rico's resident commissioner, Jennifer Gonzalez Colon, called the remarks despicable,
*  inappropriate and disgusting.
*  During his time on the stage, Tony Hinchcliffe also mocked a black man whom he said carved
*  watermelons for Halloween.
*  Another speaker called Kamala Harris the Antichrist, waving a cross.
*  Democratic vice presidential candidate Governor Tim Walz compared Trump's rally to the pro-Nazi
*  rally held at Madison Square Garden in 1939.
*  Meanwhile, Kamala Harris held major rallies over the weekend, including in Houston, where
*  she campaigned with Beyonce Friday night.
*  Harris addressed abortion rights in her speech.
*  He brags about overturning Roe v. Wade in his own words, quote, I did it and I'm proud
*  you have done it.
*  That's what he says.
*  And one has to ask, proud that women are dying?
*  Proud that doctors and nurses could be thrown in prison for life, for administering life-saving
*  care?
*  At a rally in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Michelle Obama took to the stage to warn against another
*  Trump presidency.
*  I hope that you'll forgive me if I'm a little angry that we are indifferent to his
*  erratic behavior, his obvious mental decline, his history as a convicted felon, a known
*  slumlord, a predator found liable for sexual abuse.
*  In media news, the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post are both facing turmoil after
*  the paper's publishers announced no presidential endorsements would be made this year.
*  The L.A. Times is owned by billionaire Patrick Sunshung, and the Washington Post is owned
*  by Amazon's Jeff Bezos.
*  Two veteran journalists at the L.A. Times, Robert Greene and Karen Klein, resigned in
*  as did the editorial's editor, Mario Garza, who wrote, quote,
*  In other election news, a judge in Virginia has blocked an attempt by the state's Republican
*  governor Glenn Youngkin to purge close to 2,000 Virginians from the voter rolls.
*  The judge ruled the purge violated the National Voter Registration Act.
*  The U.N. is warning of atrocious crimes in Sudan's central Khizri state after reports
*  of mass killings by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.
*  At least 124 civilians were killed by the RSF over the past week, according to On the
*  Ground reports.
*  The year-and-a-half-long war in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced
*  more than 11 million and triggered a devastating humanitarian and health crisis.
*  This is a displaced mother in South Kordofan state, whose son died of hunger.
*  I held him up, and I found his body stiffened.
*  I carried him, and I ran to my neighbor, and I asked her to have a look at him.
*  She told me, Your son is gone.
*  He used to tell me, When the road to Khartoum opens, we will go back.
*  In Uruguay, voters will cast ballots in a presidential runoff next month after no candidate
*  obtained sufficient support to claim victory in Sunday's election.
*  Yamandou Orsi, a center-left former mayor and history teacher, won the most votes but
*  the 50 percent threshold to outright defeat Álvaro Delgado of the ruling center-right
*  Partido Nacional.
*  Orsi is an ally of the former president, José Pepe Mujica, an ex-guerrilla-term politician
*  who is credited with turning Uruguayan to South America's most socially liberal country.
*  Former Bolivian president Evo Morales blamed sitting president Luis Arce after Morales's
*  vehicle came under fire and what Morales said was an attempted assassination Sunday.
*  This comes amidst mounting tensions between Arce and Morales.
*  Both men, belonging to the ruling MAS party, have announced plans to represent the party
*  in Bolivia's 2025 presidential election.
*  Arce has accused Morales of destabilizing Bolivia by calling for road blockades and
*  protests.
*  Morales has said he's being persecuted by Arce's government, including what he claims
*  are false accusations of statutory rape.
*  And in Arizona, President Biden issued a formal apology for government-run Native American
*  boarding schools, which separated indigenous families and sought to exterminate native cultures.
*  Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first-ever Native American cabinet secretary, addressed
*  the event at the Gila Country Community School.
*  Tens of thousands of indigenous children as young as four years old were taken from their
*  communities and forced into boarding schools run by the U.S. government and religious institutions.
*  These federal Indian boarding schools have impacted every indigenous person I know.
*  Some are survivors, some are descendants, but we all carry the trauma that these policies
*  and these places inflicted.
*  Biden's speech was briefly interrupted by an indigenous protester who shouted,
*  How can you apologize for a genocide while committing a genocide in Palestine?
*  We'll have more on this story later in the broadcast with Nick Tilson, founder of the
*  Indigenous Organizing Group and DN Collective.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
