In Gaza, at least 41 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since midnight, including more Palestinians targeted by Israeli forces while seeking food and humanitarian aid. This comes as UNICEF is warning Gaza is facing what amounts to a “man-made drought” with children at risk of dying from thirst due to Israel’s blockade. We go to Dr. Mark Brauner, an emergency medicine physician who is currently volunteering at the Nasser Hospital in Gaza. He describes “execution-style” killings of Palestinians at food distribution sites and the desperate lack of baby formula leading to the deaths of children suffering from malnutrition and starvation.

*  at the private militarized so-called aid sites, which replaced U.N. distribution centers in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=19.32s)]
*  May. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  The entire population of Gaza, 2.1 million people, experience prolonged shortages of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=26.08s)]
*  food. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=31.839999999999996s)]
*  Half a million are in a catastrophic situation of hunger, acute malnutrition, starvation [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  and illness, according to the World Health Organization. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=37.599999999999994s)]
*  This comes as UNICEF's warning. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=41.339999999999996s)]
*  Gaza is also on the brink of what amounts to a man-made drought, with children at risk [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=43.28s)]
*  of dying of thirst due to Israel's blockade. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=49.42s)]
*  UNICEF's also reporting more than 5,000 children under the age of five were treated [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=53.52s)]
*  last month for acute malnutrition amidst Israel's near-total blockade of aid. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  In a moment, we'll be joined by Dr. Marc Bronner, volunteering at Nasser Hospital in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=63.84s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=68.12s)]
*  But first, let's turn to a video of him speaking from the hospital. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=69.12s)]
*  … more than 100 children that are suffering from malnutrition and starvation. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  Many are premature infants who absolutely, 100 percent, rely on this formula and specialized [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=78.4s)]
*  formulas to live. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  There's no substitute. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  If they try anything else, they'll die. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=88.76s)]
*  There are thousands in the community. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=91.62s)]
*  They are 48 hours away from having no formula. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=93.92s)]
*  This is not a made-up crisis. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  This is real. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  This is a 27-week preemie here who has ARDS, has respiratory problems, has feeding issues [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=103.16s)]
*  and needs formula. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=110.8s)]
*  There are 48 hours until it's gone. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=111.8s)]
*  Dr. Marc Bronner joins us live now from Nasser Hospital in Gaza, in Chanyounes. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=115.28s)]
*  Dr. Bronner, thanks so much for being with us. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=121.28s)]
*  Can you describe the situation? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=124.16s)]
*  Once again, we're reporting since midnight, 41 Palestinians have been gunned down. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=126.52s)]
*  Yesterday, on Monday, Israeli forces killed at least 71 Palestinians, including 50 people [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=132.2s)]
*  waiting to receive aid. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=137.76s)]
*  Can you explain, you have been treating some of the people who were injured? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=139.92s)]
*  What are their injuries? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=145.2s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  Thanks, Amy. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, we're seeing a very predictable pattern shortly after the so-called aid distribution [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  centers open. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=156.2s)]
*  We just get, we hear ambulances flying towards the hospital, private vehicles, donkey-drawn [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=157.48s)]
*  carts bringing in people, streams after streams of people. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=165.0s)]
*  They often have isolated gunshot wounds to their head, to their neck, in the very center [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=170.68s)]
*  of their chest. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=177.28s)]
*  There's very high lethality, so a large percentage of the patients that come in are already dead. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=180.32s)]
*  And then we kind of move quickly, transition quickly to the next patient. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=187.08s)]
*  We're seeing lots of children, adolescents, teenagers, we're seeing some older people, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=192.16s)]
*  but it's really more execution style than the typical blast injuries that we see, which [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=198.72s)]
*  tend to be more multi-systemic, like head, neck, chest, and abdomen with shrapnel. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=205.96s)]
*  These are really isolated, targeted types of injuries that are much more consistent [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=213.36s)]
*  with the firsthand reports that we're getting. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=219.52s)]
*  And a lot of the video that we're watching from the so-called food distribution centers [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=222.60000000000002s)]
*  where it's kind of like a perverted squid games where they're given a certain period [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=226.72s)]
*  of time to get the aid. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=232.84s)]
*  And if there's any chaos, then they just start opening fire. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=235.52s)]
*  And then we see it in our facility 20, 30 minutes later. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=240.68s)]
*  And Doctor, the speaker of the Palestinian National Council, Rawin Fatu, said that, he [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=246.8s)]
*  said, quote, never in the history of war have pain and hunger been turned into tools for [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=254.08s)]
*  mass murder, aid used as bait for death, and food distribution centers turned into arenas [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=259.36s)]
*  for mass executions. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=266.04s)]
*  Are you hearing from these patients who live through this or who are wounded by just trying [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=269.36s)]
*  to get food? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=277.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=278.8s)]
*  Well, you know, they're very aware of the risk. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=279.8s)]
*  You know, they sit down and contemplate the risk of going. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=283.36s)]
*  And we often will see teenage boys who want to be heroic for their family and end up going. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=289.0s)]
*  And they are hypervigilant, and they are extremely afraid. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=297.04s)]
*  And they approach with caution, and they're constantly looking for potential areas to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=306.0s)]
*  dive under in case shooting starts. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=310.48s)]
*  So it's this really protest frenetic situation. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=312.72s)]
*  And yeah, and it's just, you know, they're trying to generate fear, which is part of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=318.32000000000005s)]
*  it, but it really is sort of like displacement by death. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=325.6s)]
*  And, you know, I did a little bit of research myself. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=329.56s)]
*  I'm not an expert in this area, but I don't think this is, you know, this has never been [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=332.64s)]
*  experienced before in moderate history that I can tell. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=337.0s)]
*  Now you've worked as a volunteer previously in Haiti and Mozambique and rural Mexico. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=342.24s)]
*  How does Gaza compare? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=349.48s)]
*  Well, you know, quite frankly, you know, all of these other situations, I think, you know, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=352.32s)]
*  right after the earthquake in Haiti, you know, things were pretty chaotic. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=357.92s)]
*  But you know, Mozambique was, you know, sort of during their early Renaissance and, you [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=362.84s)]
*  know, six, seven years ago, and things were really calm and beautiful and growing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=369.44s)]
*  So, you know, I haven't been in the military. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=377.84s)]
*  And, you know, so I knew intellectually that I was going to a war zone, and I knew the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=380.96s)]
*  risk and I was, you know, quite frankly, very afraid. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=387.47999999999996s)]
*  And what I've what I've experienced here, you know, I've been I feel relatively safe [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=391.44s)]
*  at Nasser Hospital. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=396.52s)]
*  But it is just nothing can prepare you for this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=399.2s)]
*  I've seen a lot of trauma in my life, but I haven't seen 50 in a day. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=403.08s)]
*  I haven't, you know, pronounced 20 dead people in one shift before. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=407.79999999999995s)]
*  There's nothing that can prepare you for this. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=416.12s)]
*  You know, I was also worried that this was the intensity of this was going to hurt me. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=418.44s)]
*  I was going to have PTSD and I kind of thought about things that I could do to, you know, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=424.52s)]
*  to attenuate that kind of injury when I get home. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=429.72s)]
*  But instead, it's been a really uplifting experience meeting, you know, my nurse and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=433.32000000000005s)]
*  physician, allied health colleagues here at the hospital and working with them kind of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=439.72s)]
*  day and night with one mass casualty after another. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=445.64000000000004s)]
*  And working really arm to arm and seeing the resilience and the joy and the love that still [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=451.40000000000003s)]
*  comes through and a sense of family and, you know, forward thinking. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=459.72s)]
*  Let me ask you, we might have lost the audio. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=467.24s)]
*  Dr. Browner, are you still there? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=473.8s)]
*  I am. Thank you. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=476.16s)]
*  Oh, if you could comment on the Wafa news agency reporting another Palestinian child [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=477.16s)]
*  has died of malnutrition. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=482.2s)]
*  Three-year-old Hassan Barbak died earlier Monday after suffering kidney and liver damage [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=484.08s)]
*  amid soaring blood acid levels due to acute malnutrition. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=489.4s)]
*  The boy's brother also previously died of hunger. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=493.84s)]
*  The reports are their family had urgently appealed to transfer the children for treatment, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=497.64s)]
*  but Israeli authorities denied their request. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=503.44s)]
*  Can you talk about this issue of hunger? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=505.79999999999995s)]
*  And also UNICEF warning Gaza is facing what amounts to a man-made drought with children [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=508.32s)]
*  at risk of dying of thirst? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=516.04s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=518.4399999999999s)]
*  I, you know, I was really fortunate enough to personally meet what we've been euphemistically [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  calling baby Hassan because, you know, he was really three years old, but he weighed [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=528.68s)]
*  less than half of what his normal body weight should be. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  He had a complicated metabolic disorder, but he really wasn't dying from his complex [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=536.48s)]
*  medical, you know, diseases. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=542.88s)]
*  He was dying from the policy of not opening the borders and getting food. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=545.16s)]
*  And he died as a direct, direct result of that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=553.84s)]
*  And you know, we actually, my three U.S. colleagues and I, when we met Hassan a few days ago, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=557.96s)]
*  we looked at each other and we said, we've got to do something about this. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=566.58s)]
*  It was so compelling. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=572.0799999999999s)]
*  Within 30 minutes, we got the domain name GFC25.org, the Gaza formula countdown, for [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=574.04s)]
*  48 hours. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=581.52s)]
*  And we started making a very amateurish but heartfelt plea to the world to try to get [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=582.8399999999999s)]
*  in formula. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=588.52s)]
*  You know, and we were not successful and, you know, baby Hassan died. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=589.52s)]
*  And, you know, the campaign that we built was, you know, in retrospect, a little bit, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=596.8000000000001s)]
*  you know, amateurish and half-baked. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=604.76s)]
*  But you know, there were just four American physicians sitting there with this child and [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=607.92s)]
*  feeling compelled to do something. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=615.48s)]
*  And what we did wasn't enough. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=619.32s)]
*  But we're going to continue to kind of build on this and, you know, to demand the opening [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=621.88s)]
*  the borders to food, a specialized formula. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=628.36s)]
*  You know, so the Freedom Hospital, which is just adjacent to Nasser, they've got 100 children [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=632.88s)]
*  at risk. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=638.6s)]
*  And these children are at risk day to day because, you know, they never get a month's [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=639.6s)]
*  worth of food. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=645.88s)]
*  And they get a day or two days or three days. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=648.2399999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, there's so much stress, unnecessary stress that occurs because of [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=651.3599999999999s)]
*  this situation. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=658.04s)]
*  And we need sustainability. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=660.0s)]
*  We need to work policy. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=661.76s)]
*  But this is, you know, this is a much more than a policy level thing. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=664.5999999999999s)]
*  This is, you know, like a humanitarian issue. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=669.88s)]
*  And we need to, you know, open the borders to food. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  As far as the scarcity of water, you know, that is, I believe that, you know, humans [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=676.92s)]
*  can go, you know, months without food, but we can only go three days without water. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=682.1999999999999s)]
*  And but I have not personally seen that yet. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=687.52s)]
*  You know, we see the community streaming in 24-7 with, you know, water containers and [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=690.84s)]
*  vessels to fill their water with potable water and leaving them. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=699.48s)]
*  Right now, I'm viewing, you know, three or four dozen people walking away with water [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=703.8000000000001s)]
*  cans right now. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=708.8000000000001s)]
*  So that is very possible. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=709.8000000000001s)]
*  I believe that reporting makes sense to me, but I have not yet personally witnessed that. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52huvxgEqSk&t=712.08s)]
