*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Officials in Gaza say Israeli forces killed 274 Palestinians, including at least 64 children,
*  in the Nusayrat refugee camp during an Israeli military daytime raid on Saturday to free
*  four Israelis who'd been held hostage in Gaza since October 7th.
*  The hostages had been held in two apartments in Nusayrat, one of the largest refugee camps
*  in Gaza.
*  For two hours, Israeli forces attacked the area by air, land and sea.
*  One Israeli soldier died in the raid.
*  Hamas is claiming three other hostages were also killed.
*  Over 700 Palestinians were injured inside the refugee camp, a survivor described the
*  massacre.
*  We were in Nusayrat camp.
*  Special forces arrived from an Apache helicopter, and there was a white car with special forces.
*  The Apaches started to bomb and fire directly at people.
*  There was a large number of martyrs and injured people.
*  People fled.
*  There was a big number of displaced people.
*  Schools and hospitals are filled with displaced people.
*  There was a large number of martyrs and firing was direct.
*  We brought 10 injured people in one ambulance.
*  One of them was shot directly.
*  We barely made it out through the alleyways.
*  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called for an emergency UN Security Council session
*  to discuss what he called a bloody massacre, as the overall Palestinian death toll in Gaza
*  has topped 37,000.
*  The United States reportedly provided intelligence to Israel to aid the hostage rescue effort,
*  including drone imagery collected over Gaza.
*  For months, the U.S. has been flying MQ-9 Reaper drones over Gaza.
*  Israel evacuated the hostages from a beach near where the U.S. built a temporary pier
*  to bring humanitarian aid to Gaza.
*  The U.S. has denied the pier was used during the Israeli military operation.
*  Israel is also denying claims it used a humanitarian aid truck to infiltrate the refugee camp.
*  The Israeli military said the four hostages, Noah Argamani, Ahmaud Mayer-Jan, Andrei Kozlov
*  and Shlomi Ziv, were all in good medical condition.
*  This all comes as Israel is facing increasing pressure to agree to a ceasefire and hostage
*  deal.
*  On Saturday night, hours after the hostages were freed, thousands of Israeli protesters
*  took to the streets in Tel Aviv.
*  Police fired water cannons and made at least 33 arrests.
*  On Sunday, Israeli War Cabinet member Benny Gantz resigned from Benjamin Netanyahu's
*  government and called for new elections.
*  Regrettably, Netanyahu is preventing us from advancing toward true victory, which is the
*  justification for the ongoing and painful cost of war.
*  That is why we are leaving the emergency government today with a heavy heart, but with full heart.
*  Shortly after Benny Gantz resigned, Israel's far-right national security minister Itamar
*  Ben-Gavir demanded a spot in the War Cabinet.
*  This comes as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is back in the Middle East for meetings
*  in Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Qatar, to push for the ceasefire and hostage deal outlined
*  by President Biden.
*  The United Nations has added Israel to its so-called list of shame, a blacklist of nations
*  and groups that violate the rights of children in armed conflicts.
*  Other nations on the U.N. list include Russia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia,
*  Syria, Burma, Afghanistan and Haiti.
*  The U.N. is also adding the Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad to the list of shame.
*  In Washington, D.C., tens of thousands of protesters formed a symbolic red line around
*  the White House Saturday to protest the Biden administration's Gaza policy.
*  A major pro-Palestinian rally was also held in London Saturday.
*  Meanwhile, in Canada, police fired tear gas and pepper spray Friday to disperse protesters
*  at McGill University in Montreal, where students had taken over administrative building.
*  Fifteen arrests were made.
*  In Spain, hundreds of protesters lay down on the ground outside the Guggenheim Museum
*  in Balbao to symbolize the mass casualties in Gaza.
*  In France, President Emmanuel Macron Sunday called a snap election for June 30th following
*  major losses in European Union elections to the far-right National Rally Party.
*  EMMANUEL MACRON, President of the United States of America
*  After having proceeded with the consultations as provided in Article 12 of our Constitution,
*  I decided to give back to you the choice for the future of our parliament with a vote.
*  And so, I am dissolving tonight our National Assembly.
*  Marine Le Pen's far-right RN party won over 30 percent of the vote in preliminary tallies,
*  more than twice as many votes as Macron.
*  The RN announced 28-year-old Jordan Bardella as its candidate for prime minister.
*  The far-right made gains elsewhere, including in Italy, Austria and Germany, where the extreme-right
*  alternative for Germany gained six seats and placed second behind Chancellor Olaf Scholz's
*  Social Democrats.
*  Despite the boost for hard-right groups, centrist parties will still hold an outright majority
*  in the 720-seat European Parliament.
*  Nationalist anti-immigrant groups are expected to control 130 seats.
*  On Saturday, an estimated 15,000 protesters took to the streets of Berlin to call out
*  the rising power of the far-right in Germany.
*  Meanwhile, in Brussels, a group of scientists and climate activists on Friday blocked the
*  entrance to the EU Commission.
*  We blocked the entrance to the European Commission because we are trying to push for degrowth.
*  No political party really has degrowth on its agenda, and degrowth is a necessity if
*  we want to survive this century, if we don't want to face ecological, civilizational collapse.
*  And so we really need to talk about it.
*  Doctors Without Borders recovered the bodies of 12 asylum seekers off the coast of Libya
*  and the Mediterranean Sea and transported another 165 survivors of a shipwreck to Italy
*  Friday.
*  Rescue workers warned the victory of the far-right in EU elections will lead to more migrant
*  deaths.
*  Following the rescue mission, MSF blasted the, quote, devastating and bloody European
*  policies on migration and non-assistance for people taking the Mediterranean, unquote.
*  This is the head of the Red Cross in Spain's Canary Islands describing the treacherous
*  journey undertaken by thousands each month.
*  It's a journey that, depending on where it starts, means up to 10 days at sea, where
*  anything can happen, such as the ship sinking, tough weather conditions, storms.
*  It's a route that has already taken on many lives, some of which we know about and many
*  others we don't, because they have disappeared.
*  In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, fighters with the allied Democratic Forces,
*  a group associated with the Islamic State, killed at least 41 people in an overnight
*  attack Friday in a school in a village near the border with Uganda.
*  The majority of victims were students.
*  The ADF is also accused of another attack in eastern Congo earlier last week that killed
*  at least 16 people.
*  In Sudan, the last hospital in Al-Fasher, North Darfur, has shut down after the paramilitary
*  Rapid support forces raided and looted it Saturday, opening fire inside the hospital.
*  It's not clear if anyone was killed or wounded in the attack.
*  This comes as the World Food Program warns Sudan is on track to become the world's
*  largest humanitarian crisis as aid groups struggle to get food to those in need.
*  On Friday, over 40 people were reported killed in RSF attacks on Umdurman, known as the twin
*  city to the capital Khartoum.
*  This came just two days after RSF fighters killed over 100 people, including dozens of
*  children, in a village in Al-Jazeera state.
*  The U.N. is warning the ongoing fighting in Sudan is creating a massive displacement crisis
*  in the region.
*  SULMA AL-JUZI, UNHCR FORCES FORCE FORCEMENT CRIISES
*  Some 12 million have been forced to flee their homes in Sudan, with over two million crossing
*  borders into neighboring countries, mainly Chad, South Sudan and Egypt, often arriving
*  in extremely vulnerable conditions and highly traumatized.
*  In Uganda, the environmental activist Stephen Kwikoriza is receiving hospital care after
*  being released from a nearly week-long detention Sunday, where he was reportedly beaten by
*  members of the army.
*  He's believed to have been targeted due to his protests against the French oil company
*  Total Energies, which is involved in the East African crude oil pipeline project known as
*  ECOP.
*  Environmental activists have been trying to stop development of the 900-mile pipeline,
*  which is set to transport oil from Uganda to Tanzania's Indian Ocean port of Tanga.
*  Narendra Modi has been sworn in as India's prime minister for a third term.
*  Modi's Hindu nationalist BJP lost its parliamentary majority in the recent election, forcing it
*  to form a new coalition government.
*  Modi becomes the first Indian leader since Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms
*  as prime minister.
*  Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is finally acknowledged taking more free vacations paid
*  for by billionaire conservative megadonor Harlan Crowe.
*  In a filing Friday, Thomas disclosed he accepted a pair of trips in 2019, one to Indonesia
*  and another to the Bohemian Grove in California.
*  Last year, ProPublica revealed Thomas had failed to disclose at least 38 luxury trips
*  gifted by Crowe and three other right-wing billionaires dating back decades.
*  Environmental groups are criticizing the Biden administration for weakening a plan to make
*  gas-powered SUVs and pickup trucks more fuel-efficient.
*  Last year, the National Highway Transportation Safety proposed hiking the average fuel economy
*  standards for the vehicles to 58 miles per gallon by 2032.
*  But under rules issued Friday, the figure has been cut to 50 miles per gallon, just
*  a small increase from the current standard.
*  Dan Becker of the Center for Biological Diversity said the new rule will leave automakers free
*  to quote, make cars, SUVs and pickups that will guzzle and pollute for decades and keep
*  America stuck on oil, he said.
*  And a parole hearing is being held today for the imprisoned Native American activist Leonard
*  Peltier, who's been jailed since 1977.
*  Amnesty International has urged the U.S. Parole Commission to grant the 79-year-old parole
*  on humanitarian grounds.
*  Peltier, who is a member of the American Indian Movement, was convicted of involvement in
*  the killing of two FBI agents, the Pine Ridge Reservation, but he has long maintained his
*  innocence.
*  Supporters of Leonard Peltier fear today's hearing could be his last chance to support
*  his freedom.
*  This is his first full parole hearing in 15 years.
*  To hear our interviews with Leonard Peltier, as well as those about his case over the years,
*  go to democracynow.org.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
