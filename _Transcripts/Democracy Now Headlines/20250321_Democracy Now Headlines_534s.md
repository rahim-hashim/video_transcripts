We get an update on legal efforts to stop the Trump administration from deporting Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, who has been detained for two weeks despite being a legal resident with a green card. The Trump administration has explicitly said it is targeting Khalil because of his pro-Palestinian advocacy during protests at Columbia University last year, invoking a rarely used provision of immigration law to claim he could undermine U.S. foreign policy. Federal Judge Jesse Furman recently ordered the case to be moved to New Jersey, even though Khalil himself remains locked up in an ICE jail in Louisiana. “In doing so, Judge Furman acknowledged that the right court to hear this is here, in the area where all of these events played out, where Mahmoud’s family is, his eight-month-pregnant wife is, his community is and his lawyers are,” says Shezza Abboushi Dallal, a member of Khalil’s legal team.

**Democracy Now Headlines:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA)
*  This is Democracy Now—DemocracyNow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=3.16s)]
*  We turn now to look at the Trump administration's targeting of foreign-born students who have [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=4.36s)]
*  expressed support for Palestinians. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=8.42s)]
*  Colombia's student protest leader Mahmoud Khalil has been jailed and iced detention [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  for two weeks, even though he's a legal permanent resident of the United States. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=15.56s)]
*  On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman cleared the way for Khalil to stay in the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=21.26s)]
*  U.S. and keep challenging his arrest. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=27.16s)]
*  The judge transferred Mahmoud Khalil's case to New Jersey, where he was initially held [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=29.86s)]
*  before being transferred to Louisiana. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=35.98s)]
*  Earlier this week, Mahmoud Khalil dictated a letter to his lawyers. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=38.94s)]
*  He said, in part, quote, "...the Trump administration is targeting me as part of a broader strategy [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=42.24s)]
*  to suppress dissent. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=47.739999999999995s)]
*  Visa holders, green card carriers and citizens alike will all be targeted for their political [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  beliefs. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=55.82s)]
*  In the weeks ahead, students, advocates and elected officials must unite to defend the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=56.82s)]
*  right to protest for Palestine. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=61.26s)]
*  At stake are not just our voices, but the fundamental civil liberties of all," he said. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=63.62s)]
*  We're joined right now by Sheza Abou Shidalal, a staff attorney with the CLEAR Project at [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=69.54s)]
*  CUNY School of Law, a member of Mahmoud Khalil's legal defense team. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=75.06s)]
*  Thanks so much for being with us. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  We've been following this very closely, and there's been mass protests across the country. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=80.38s)]
*  Thousands have turned out protesting for Khalil. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=84.86s)]
*  His wife, an American citizen left here in New York, she is eight months pregnant. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=88.54s)]
*  Explain the latest. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=94.74s)]
*  Explain Judge Furman's decision and what it means for Khalil to be going to New Jersey, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=95.94s)]
*  if he in fact is. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=102.22s)]
*  He's still in Louisiana. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=103.42s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=104.42s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Amy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=106.28s)]
*  On Wednesday, Judge Furman in the Southern District of New York ordered the case transferred [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=109.98s)]
*  to a federal court in New Jersey. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=116.46000000000001s)]
*  In doing so, Judge Furman acknowledged that the right court to hear this is here in the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=119.58s)]
*  area where all of these events played out, where Mahmoud's family is, his eight months [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=128.74s)]
*  pregnant wife is, his community is and his lawyers are, and rejected the government's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=135.26s)]
*  argument that the right court to hear this is in Louisiana, where they covertly transferred [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=142.06s)]
*  him over the course of hours of his nighttime detention two weekends ago. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  Which makes it very difficult for you to speak with him, right? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=152.7s)]
*  You wanted the defense team demanded that they be able to speak, not monitored, because [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=155.78s)]
*  in fact that's what happens at ICE detention facilities. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=161.78s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=165.1s)]
*  So what you're referring to is that during our first court appearance in the Southern [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=166.1s)]
*  District of New York, we sought and received a court order allowing us to have legal calls [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=171.14s)]
*  with our client. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=176.6s)]
*  Regular calls in ICE detention facilities are subject to monitoring by the government [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=177.6s)]
*  and therefore use against people who are being detained. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=183.0s)]
*  And so we had not been able at that point to have those types of legal calls. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=186.9s)]
*  we have been able to since. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=192.3s)]
*  And we are ready to continue this legal battle in New Jersey, where a number of really important [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  legal battles will be hashed out in the days and weeks to come. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=203.86s)]
*  And why New Jersey, even though he was first transferred, what, to Elizabeth, by Judge [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=206.74s)]
*  Fuhrman? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, he said he should be brought up from Louisiana, said New Jersey, not New York. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  And why is that significant to you? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=216.62s)]
*  He said New Jersey because at the exact time when, and this was in the early hours of the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=218.7s)]
*  morning, hours from Mahmoud's detention, at the exact time when the habeas petition challenging [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=223.74s)]
*  his unlawful detention was filed, he was in an ICE detention facility in Elizabeth, New [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=231.22s)]
*  Jersey. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=236.38s)]
*  And so the court ordered transfer to New Jersey because of that fact and again acknowledging [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=237.74s)]
*  that contrary to the incredible claims that the government is making that Louisiana is [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=243.78s)]
*  the right court to hear this, to have him battle out the challenge to his unlawful detention [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=249.82s)]
*  in Louisiana would mean to have him fight his case in a state that is 1400 miles away [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=255.48s)]
*  from his eight months pregnant wife, who's due next month, from us, his counsel, and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=262.64s)]
*  from the place where all of this played out. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=269.26s)]
*  I want to turn to the video showing the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil on March 8th, when he was [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=271.41999999999996s)]
*  detained by plainclothes officers who did not identify themselves. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=277.7s)]
*  The video was filmed by his eight-month pregnant wife, Dr. Noor Abdullah, whose voice you're [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=283.46s)]
*  hearing in this clip. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=288.9s)]
*  You're going to be under arrest. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=290.73999999999995s)]
*  So turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=293.46s)]
*  OK, let's not—OK, OK, he's not resisting. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=296.7s)]
*  He's giving me his phone, OK? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=299.7s)]
*  He's not—I'm interested. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=301.42s)]
*  He's not resisting. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=302.9s)]
*  Like— [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=303.9s)]
*  There's no reason for this. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=304.9s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=305.9s)]
*  You're going to have to come with us. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=306.9s)]
*  Can you please specify what agency is taking him, please? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=308.9s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=313.9s)]
*  Nobody—they're not talking to me. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=314.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=317.9s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=318.9s)]
*  The lawyer would like to speak to somebody. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=319.9s)]
*  Oh, my God, they're literally running away from me. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=321.9s)]
*  So, there we have the video that the ACLU released. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=325.09999999999997s)]
*  Mahmoud could not know who these people were. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=332.21999999999997s)]
*  It was a plane—they were in plainclothes. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=335.26s)]
*  The car was plainclothes. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=337.41999999999996s)]
*  It was in their lobby. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=339.41999999999996s)]
*  And what about this news of Elvin Hernandez, a DHS officer, who Trump had honored in his [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=341.06s)]
*  first term in the presidency, I think pointed him out at the State of the Union address? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=348.26s)]
*  He was one of those who arrested him? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=353.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=355.9s)]
*  So, you can see in the video how alarming and distressing the whole ordeal was. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=356.9s)]
*  You have multiple Department of Homeland Security agents in plainclothes closing in on Mahmoud [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=361.85999999999996s)]
*  and his wife in the lobby of their Columbia faculty— [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=368.85999999999996s)]
*  They had just come back from Easter. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=371.5s)]
*  —or Columbia housing. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=372.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=373.5s)]
*  They were entering their building, coming back from Iftar. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=375.02s)]
*  This is Columbia University housing, and they're followed in and closed in on by a bunch of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=378.86s)]
*  agents in plainclothes, and they're having trouble receiving any information at all from [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=385.02000000000004s)]
*  these men about who they are. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=390.38s)]
*  They're pleading for information about who they are, where they're being taken, and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=392.5s)]
*  receiving next to nothing, as you can see. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=397.58000000000004s)]
*  Did Columbia give them permission, ICE, DHS permission, to go in their housing? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=399.90000000000003s)]
*  I mean, Mahmoud had appealed to the Columbia president in the days before saying he faced danger. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=405.5s)]
*  We don't know what Columbia has done, but what we know is what we see, which is that [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=412.5s)]
*  these officers are inside of the building, again, Columbia housing. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=418.98s)]
*  And we also know from Mahmoud and his wife that they pleaded for assistance from the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=423.94s)]
*  Columbia University administration in the days leading up to this detention and arrest. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=429.3s)]
*  And they received no support. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=437.62s)]
*  They have yet to receive any sort of support or outreach from the university. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=438.94s)]
*  And we know that Columbia University has had a track record over the course of the past [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=444.02000000000004s)]
*  more than a year and a half of collaborating with law enforcement agencies, giving them [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=449.22s)]
*  information, inviting them onto campus to arrest their own students. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=456.26s)]
*  Certainly, they've taken the posture of collaborators and not a protective posture [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=460.38s)]
*  of their students, their staff, their faculty against this administration and the last's [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=467.02s)]
*  agendas to target advocates for Palestinian rights and liberation. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=473.3s)]
*  I want to read more from Mahmoud Khalil's letter from jail. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=477.9s)]
*  He wrote, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=481.9s)]
*  Shehza Abushid-Allal, thank you so much for giving us this update. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=512.38s)]
*  Staff attorney with The CLEAR Project at CUNY School of Law, member of Mahmoud Khalil's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDny8UAHQIA&t=516.1s)]
