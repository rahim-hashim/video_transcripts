An executive order that purports to combat antisemitism on university campuses is likely to chill free speech and target students for pro-Palestine, antiwar and anti-racist views. The order, signed by President Trump, threatens to deport noncitizen college students and other international visitors who take part in protests considered antisemitic under a broad and contested definition of the term. Though the order gives them new teeth, these threats of deportation are not new, as our guest Momodou Taal, a doctoral student at Cornell University who was threatened with deportation last year, can attest. While public outcry forced Cornell to lift Taal's suspension and allow him a limited return to campus, he is still effectively banned from campus life and blocked from teaching positions. "There's somewhat of a great irony that students who were protesting apartheid are now subject to forms of exclusion bordering on apartheid," says Taal about his ongoing exclusion.

Rights groups and legal scholars say the new executive order violates constitutional free speech rights and would likely draw legal challenges if implemented. "This is basically a textbook authoritarian playbook meant to stifle any criticism of what's going on in Israel," explains our other guest, Etan Nechin, a New York correspondent for _Haaretz_. Students like Taal, however, say they will not allow the government and their administrations to prevent them from speaking out. Taal says his pro-Palestine activism comes out of his obligations as "a human being" and that "when fascism is at the door, what we do is come together and unite even stronger."

*  that has sent a chill across campuses. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=15.88s)]
*  In a White House fact sheet accompanying the executive order, Trump threatened to deport [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  non-citizen college students and other international visitors who take part in pro-Palestinian [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=24.26s)]

*  Trump said, quote, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=32.46s)]

*  I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=44.02s)]
*  which have been infested with radicalism like never before, Trump said. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=50.54s)]
*  The executive order promises to, quote, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=56.1s)]
*  marshal all federal resources to combat what it called the explosion of anti-Semitism on [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=57.94s)]
*  our campuses and streets, unquote, since October 7, 2023. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=62.86s)]
*  It calls on the Secretary of Education to provide an inventory and analysis of all court [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=67.86s)]
*  cases involving anti-Semitism at colleges, universities and K-12 schools within 60 days. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=72.34s)]
*  The order requires colleges and universities to, quote, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=78.62s)]
*  monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff that could be considered [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=81.18s)]
*  anti-Semitic or supportive of terrorism potentially leading to their deportation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  In response to Israel's 16th month military assault on Gaza, campuses across the U.S. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=92.86s)]
*  erupted an unprecedented wave of pro-Palestinian protests in solidarity with Gaza. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=99.26s)]
*  University administrations responded with a harsh crackdown. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  At least 3,000 people were arrested or detained during the height of the protests last year. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=108.02000000000001s)]
*  Rights groups and legal scholars say the new executive order violates constitutional free [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=113.98s)]
*  speech rights and would likely draw legal challenges if implemented. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=118.94s)]
*  For more on this executive order, we're going to two guests. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=123.44s)]
*  In Ithaca, New York, Mamadou Tal is with us, a Ph.D. student at the Department of Africana [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=126.94s)]
*  Studies at Cornell University. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=131.2s)]
*  Last year, Cornell suspended him for taking part in a campus protest calling on a Cornell [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=133.78s)]
*  to divest from Israel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=137.9s)]
*  He faced deportation until Cornell allowed him to re-enroll after massive protests, thereby [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=139.38000000000002s)]
*  extending his visa. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=145.86s)]
*  And Eitan Nechen is with us, the New York correspondent for Haaretz, where his recent [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=148.22000000000003s)]
*  piece is headlined, We Will Find You and We Will Deport You, Why Trump's Executive Order [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=152.98000000000002s)]
*  on Anti-Semitism is So Dangerous. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=158.56s)]
*  Eitan Nechen joins us from Washington, D.C., where he's covering protests of Netanyahu [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=161.46s)]
*  today at the White House. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=167.06s)]
*  We welcome you both to Democracy Now! [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=168.5s)]
*  Eitan, let's begin with you. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=170.66s)]
*  Why do you say that Trump's anti-Semitism executive order worries progressive Jewish [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=173.57999999999998s)]
*  groups, delights others, and you write that it is a major problem that he's threatening [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=180.14s)]
*  to deport students? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  As an Israeli, you write this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=189.17999999999998s)]
*  Good morning, Amy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=190.89999999999998s)]
*  Good to be on. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=192.73999999999998s)]
*  Well, this is dangerous not only for crushing dissent, but it's a deflection from what's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=194.54s)]
*  going on in Israel and Palestine, right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=201.38s)]
*  So when we focus on students who are pro-Palestinians, who some, you know, said egregious things, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=204.14s)]
*  it's self-free speech. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=209.86s)]
*  When you create an atmosphere that any dissent could be punished by deportation, that's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=211.74s)]
*  And a chilling effect not only on foreign students, but on anyone who dares to criticize [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=221.14000000000001s)]
*  Israel, the administration. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=225.98s)]
*  And this creates an atmosphere that we have seen from authoritarian regimes, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=229.5s)]
*  So this is basically a textbook authoritarian playbook meant to just stifle any criticism [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=237.18s)]
*  of what's going on in Israel. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=244.58s)]
*  And more so, this campaign, Promise, last year, and we've seen it's already been [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  implementing even before. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=254.42s)]
*  Right-wing Jewish group, Beitar, has already used AI to scrape social media to make lists [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=257.82s)]
*  of names of what they called Hamas supporters. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=268.42s)]
*  This group just now recently attacked writer Pitey Beinart for his new book about criticism [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=273.1s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=280.82s)]
*  Pitey Beinart is not a Hamas supporter, obviously. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=282.46s)]
*  So this just shows the line of, you know, between free speech and a crackdown. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=285.74s)]
*  And who runs this Beitar movement, and how did it arise? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=293.98s)]
*  Beitar U.S. is part of the Beitar movement, which is founded in the 1920s by Jabotinsky, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=299.86s)]
*  a very right-wing Zionist. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=307.86s)]
*  And they have branches all over the world. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=310.02s)]
*  So this is their U.S. branch. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=314.26s)]
*  Also, there have been messaging on Jewish and Israeli text groups urging people to complain [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=317.1s)]
*  about anybody who's supporting Hamas. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=325.18s)]
*  And the language in this order is so murky. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=328.34s)]
*  What does it mean to be supportive of Hamas, to wave Palestinian flags? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=334.06s)]
*  Because a lot of Israelis in protests have done so. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=339.38s)]
*  Is it saying that, you know, if somebody was at the right age, they would join a resistance [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=343.02s)]
*  movement? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=349.82s)]
*  Because that's what Eud Barak said, former prime minister, during his campaign in 1999. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=350.94s)]
*  This is not justifying what Hamas did on October 7th, not at all. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=357.74s)]
*  But this is the line between free speech and crackdown authoritarianism. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=362.38s)]
*  This is the aim, and this is the goal. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=367.82s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about the Heritage Foundation's Project Ester, which claims that a pro-Palestinian [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=370.58s)]
*  movement that the‚Äîthe pro-Palestinian movement here is a part of a global Hamas support network. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=377.41999999999996s)]
*  Today, they issued a 33-page document that's suggesting revoking tax-exempt status for [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=384.62s)]
*  universities who host a pro-Palestinian protest. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=391.9s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=395.62s)]
*  Is that even feasible? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=397.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=398.26s)]
*  This is‚Äîyou know, Project Ester is part of Project 2025, which aims, again, to‚Äîthrough [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=399.26s)]
*  very vague language, crackdown anybody who criticizes Israel as, you know, a terrorist [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=408.3s)]
*  supporter. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=413.66s)]
*  And this is part of the administration's and the GOP's plan to crackdown on nonprofits. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=414.82000000000005s)]
*  And we've seen that last session where they tried to pass a bill, you know, basically [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=421.34000000000003s)]
*  gutting funding for nonprofits who support terrorism or whatever that language is, a [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=428.42s)]
*  bill that will be taking on this session. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=435.34000000000003s)]
*  So this is part of a big crackdown on nonprofits and any human rights, speech rights, migrant [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=439.18s)]
*  rights. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=447.46000000000004s)]
*  We've seen this across the board. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=448.46000000000004s)]
*  Project Ester is one of the projects of 2025, you know, which centers around migration, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=451.26000000000005s)]
*  centers around attacking of minorities on dissent on the left. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=457.86s)]
*  And we've seen this. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=463.62s)]
*  This is after 9-11, obviously, when, you know, protesters against Iraq were more monitors [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=464.62s)]
*  as supporting al-Qaeda, right? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=471.1s)]
*  The FBI had filed and filed on people and nonprofits to try and stifle any dissent. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=472.9s)]
*  This is part of the same playbook. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=480.26s)]
*  What's more dangerous at this moment is Project 2025 and Elon Musk. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=482.62s)]
*  I don't think there has been in the recent history such a tie between the government [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=491.62s)]
*  and a billionaire oligarch that basically has a run on the government and can do, you [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=500.1s)]
*  know, what‚Äîas well. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=509.34000000000003s)]
*  And we've been seeing that since day one. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=511.18s)]
*  We're talking to Etan Netchen, who is the New York correspondent for the Israeli newspaper [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=514.58s)]
*  Haaretz. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=520.54s)]
*  He's in Washington, D.C., today, to cover the protests against Netanyahu. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=521.54s)]
*  It's his first visit to the United States, to the White House, since the International [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=525.62s)]
*  Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for him for crimes against humanity. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=531.4599999999999s)]
*  There were two other presidents who came to the inauguration, Bo'o of Ecuador and the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=536.98s)]
*  right-wing president of Argentina, Mal√©. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=542.4599999999999s)]
*  official White House visit that Trump is having Netanyahu. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=546.06s)]
*  They are close personal friends. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=551.3399999999999s)]
*  We're also joined by Mamadou Taw, Ph.D. student in the Department of Africana Studies [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=553.7399999999999s)]
*  at Cornell University, almost deported last year after being temporarily suspended for [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=558.4399999999999s)]
*  his pro-Palestine activism. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=564.28s)]
*  Muhammad, if you can talk about what happened to you, we would report your story in headlines. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=566.66s)]
*  There was tremendous outcry and pressure on Cornell to remove the suspension so you [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=572.62s)]
*  wouldn't be deported. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=579.18s)]
*  Explain what happened. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=580.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=581.7s)]
*  So, we partook in a protest at Statler Hotel on Cornell's campus. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=582.7s)]
*  And in that career sphere, which was taking place at Statler Hotel, there was Boeing and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=591.74s)]
*  L3 Harris, who are targets of our divestment campaign, because we know that L3 Harris and [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=597.78s)]
*  Boeing are directly involved in shipments and armaments of Israeli genocide against [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=604.02s)]
*  the Palestinian people. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=609.5799999999999s)]
*  We eventually brought the career sphere to a standstill. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=611.78s)]
*  And about a few days later, I was told that I was suspended. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=617.26s)]
*  And someone on an F1 visa, being suspended means that you use your student status, which [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=620.58s)]
*  triggers the loss of your visa effectively being deported, being asked to leave the country. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=627.9000000000001s)]
*  I was told in that meeting that I will have about 48 hours to leave the country with, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=634.5400000000001s)]
*  as you said, public pressure, support, Cornell University back down, and I am allowed to [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=640.0200000000001s)]
*  finish my degree. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=645.1800000000001s)]
*  However, I am still banned from campus. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=646.58s)]
*  I'm allowed in one building on campus to work. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=650.18s)]
*  I have to fight to be able to get library access. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=653.0999999999999s)]
*  And I think there's somewhat of a great irony that students who are protesting apartheid [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=656.38s)]
*  are now subject to forms of exclusion, bordering, and apartheid, with our movements restricted, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=661.9399999999999s)]
*  and we're only allowed to go to designated places on campus. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=668.38s)]
*  And how has your work as a graduate student continued to be affected since the university [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=675.66s)]
*  rescinded your suspension? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=686.62s)]
*  I continue to be impacted because first and foremost, I'm a student from campus life. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=689.14s)]
*  I was teaching a class to undergrads, which was effectively banned from teaching. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=697.26s)]
*  My class was taken away from me, which everyone knows is a huge part of progression with your [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=701.78s)]
*  degree. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=707.66s)]
*  My movements remain restricted. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=708.66s)]
*  I had to fight, as I said, to be able to use the library, to have work from the library, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=710.22s)]
*  to be able to go onto campus and to use certain access, certain parts of campus. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=716.86s)]
*  Right now, as I said, I'm still only allowed in one building on campus. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=722.14s)]
*  To demonstrate the egregious nature of this, I had to even fight with the university to [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=726.9s)]
*  say, if I use Cornell Health, go to see a doctor. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=732.5799999999999s)]
*  Initially, I was told I have to inform them every single time I have a doctor's appointment [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=737.8199999999999s)]
*  to be allowed onto campus. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=742.6999999999999s)]
*  Mamadou, can you respond to Trump's executive order as he talks about alien students being [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=745.34s)]
*  deported, your colleagues at Cornell and other places that you're hearing from, what kind [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=753.0999999999999s)]
*  of effect that this has had? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=758.78s)]
*  And also, I mean, you were born in Gambia. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=762.38s)]
*  You are a British citizen. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=764.8199999999999s)]
*  Why you support the Palestinians and then were involved in those protests? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=766.62s)]
*  Thank you for both those questions. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=772.02s)]
*  For the first one, of course, the executive orders, the language in which, the framing [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=774.9799999999999s)]
*  in the language of the executive orders clearly are targeting pro-Palestinian protesters, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=779.26s)]
*  international students. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=784.7399999999999s)]
*  And I think they're intended to have a chilling effect on Palestinian protest, pro-Palestinian [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=785.7399999999999s)]
*  protesters in order for them to stop protesting at the threat of deportation. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=791.3s)]
*  The message that is being sent out is if you are an international student who comes here [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=796.6999999999999s)]
*  legally, then you should not be involved in exercising your first amendment right or you [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=800.9s)]
*  will be subject to deportation. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=805.42s)]
*  And that is the intended effect. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=808.5400000000001s)]
*  I don't think it's going to work. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=810.26s)]
*  I think if anything, when fascism is at the door, what we do is come together and unite [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=811.9000000000001s)]
*  even stronger. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=816.94s)]
*  However, as for your second question, I think fundamentally, yes, I'm Gambian. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=817.94s)]
*  Yes, I'm British. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=823.1s)]
*  But fundamentally, I'm a human being. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=824.6600000000001s)]
*  And I think what Palestine does, when we say Palestine is a litmus test, we're saying that [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=827.7800000000001s)]
*  it is not that we privilege the Palestinian cause among our other, every other cause, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=832.5s)]
*  but rather Palestine holds a mirror up into the world and says, what kind of world do [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=837.3399999999999s)]
*  we want to live in? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=842.62s)]
*  Do you want to live in a world in which every single international multilateral institution [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=843.62s)]
*  is rubbish? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=848.26s)]
*  Do you want to live in a world where the ICC and the ICJ are rendered defunct and the UN [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=849.26s)]
*  rendered defunct? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=854.8599999999999s)]
*  And there's no such thing as an international cooperation of a world. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=855.8599999999999s)]
*  And people are able to do, leaders are able to act in any way they see fit and kill women [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=859.66s)]
*  and children and men and boys and end up to genocide. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=865.7s)]
*  So I think fundamentally why I get involved is because I'm a human being. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=869.38s)]
*  And finally, I will end with the university was presented with a crossroad. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=872.7s)]
*  That crossroad, will they protect those students? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=877.38s)]
*  They failed initially by suspending so many people. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=881.22s)]
*  Again, now with Trump's presidency, the university is presented with another crossroad. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=884.98s)]
*  And I'm calling on the university to not just be a bystander, but take an active position, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=892.02s)]
*  an active role to defend their students and say, we're not going to allow Trump and [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=898.1s)]
*  the right-wing fascists and outside agencies to come onto campuses and collect foreign [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=904.86s)]
*  students. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=910.06s)]
*  Mamadou, we have to leave it there. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=911.06s)]
*  Mamadou Taw was threatened with deportation. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=912.18s)]
*  That was during the Biden administration, and now it faces this executive order by Trump. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=914.14s)]
*  And I want to thank Eitan Netjian. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=919.46s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Juan Gonz√°lez. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rlMR7oyH0&t=920.78s)]
