Cuts by the Trump administration are putting children at risk, according to a new report by ProPublica. The administration has cut funds and manpower for child abuse investigations, enforcement of child support payments, child care and more. On top of that, Head Start preschools, which offer free child care to low-income parents, are being severely gutted. Democracy Now! speaks with ProPublica reporter Eli Hager on his investigation into Trump’s “War on Children.”

“It wasn’t just cuts to these more liberal-coded programs like support for child care and direct assistance to lower-income families with children, but also these programs that have much more support across the political spectrum, like funds and staffing for investigating child abuse and Child Protective Services,” says Hager.

# Trump's War on Children: DOGE Guts Head Start, Child Abuse Programs, Healthcare & More
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Nermeen Shaikh. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  We end today's show looking at what ProPublica calls the Trump administration's war on children. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=4.76s)]
*  Their new report looks at how the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOJ, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=10.28s)]
*  is putting children at risk by cutting funds for investigating child abuse, enforcing child [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=14.84s)]
*  support payments, providing childcare and more. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  We're joined now by ProPublica reporter Eli Hager. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=22.52s)]
*  So, Eli, lay out your findings. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=25.76s)]
*  Well, it's probably been a little bit hard for people to follow all of these cuts across [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=28.68s)]
*  all of these different federal agencies. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=32.72s)]
*  But one through line that we've tracked at ProPublica is cuts to programs serving children. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=34.76s)]
*  So across a lot of little-known federal agencies with names like the Children's Bureau and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=40.48s)]
*  the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, there have been cuts to both funding [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  and services and staffing for child protective services, for enforcing child support orders, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=50.86s)]
*  for childcare and all sorts of programs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=58.74s)]
*  And the through line has been that those programs serve children. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=60.78s)]
*  And, Eli, could you say, we'll get into each of the programs that you list in the piece, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=63.18s)]
*  but why do you think this hasn't been given so much publicity? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=67.74s)]
*  People aren't aware of how much poor children are being made to suffer by these cuts, or [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=71.06s)]
*  will be. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=75.94s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=76.94s)]
*  That's definitely true. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=78.02s)]
*  I think one is just the chaos and the onslaught of cuts at so many different agencies. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=79.02s)]
*  I think a number of these agencies are relatively anonymous agencies that people haven't heard [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=83.46s)]
*  of. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=87.46s)]
*  And they're also housed within very large departments like the Health and Human Services [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=88.46s)]
*  and Department of Justice. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=92.98s)]
*  And these are smaller children's offices within those large departments. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=94.34s)]
*  And I also just don't think people realize how much the federal government does for children's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=97.62s)]
*  services and for administering things like CPS and adoption across the country and things [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=101.97999999999999s)]
*  like that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=106.9s)]
*  So, what about with Head Start? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=108.86s)]
*  I mean, this is astounding. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=109.86s)]
*  It goes to one million low-income parents. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=110.86s)]
*  What this means eliminating the Lyndon Johnson program from the war on poverty. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=121.66000000000001s)]
*  There's Head Start in every community across the country. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=122.66000000000001s)]
*  This would especially affect rural areas, where often the Head Start program is the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  only child care facility or location in a whole town. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=131.62s)]
*  So, one million working parents across the country wouldn't have anywhere to send their [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=136.22s)]
*  children during the day if Head Start were to be ended, which the president's budget [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=140.9s)]
*  calls for. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=145.34s)]
*  Also, these Head Start program directors have been having trouble accessing their congressionally [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=147.06s)]
*  appropriated funds. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=152.78s)]
*  They're being directed to a DOJ Defend the Spend website, which seems to be new. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=153.78s)]
*  This says Elon Musk calls for people to have more children. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=159.18s)]
*  And they're talking about actually spending money, giving $5,000 piece to women who give [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=162.94s)]
*  birth to children. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=167.26s)]
*  Right, yes. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=169.02s)]
*  That is an irony that we noticed. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=170.78s)]
*  And you also talk about in the piece the other areas that have been impacted, including cuts [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=173.86s)]
*  to institutions that investigate child sexual abuse and internet crimes against children, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=180.98s)]
*  responding to reports of missing children and preventing youth violence. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=187.9s)]
*  If you could elaborate on some of those, like, where, under what organization or department [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=193.26s)]
*  do those fall? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=198.1s)]
*  Right, so what we noticed was that it wasn't just cuts to kind of these more liberal-coded [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=199.34s)]
*  programs like Support for Child Care and Direct Assistance to Lower Income Families with Children, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=204.22s)]
*  but also these programs that have much more support across the political spectrum, like [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=210.06s)]
*  staffing for investigating child abuse and child protective services. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=217.06s)]
*  A lot of that is funded by the Social Services Block Grant, and the entire staff that delivers [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=223.06s)]
*  that Block Grant was laid off by Robert F. Kennedy at HHS. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=227.7s)]
*  And then you also, at the Department of Justice, have cuts to or delayed or blocked funding [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=233.82s)]
*  for local law enforcement to investigate internet crimes against children for programs that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=239.06s)]
*  respond to cases of missing children, for amber alerts, for all of these things that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=244.1s)]
*  just respond to very serious cases of violence against children. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=247.98s)]
*  And talk about the cutting off of health care for what, some 800,000 children? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=252.7s)]
*  And then, of course, with the threats to Medicaid, the number, the millions of children covered [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=259.82s)]
*  by Medicaid. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=264.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think one thing that people don't realize is that children are actually the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=265.74s)]
*  They receive Medicaid in greater numbers than any other age group. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=269.78s)]
*  Nearly 40% of the people who rely on Medicaid are children, whether that's in school-based [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=274.73999999999995s)]
*  health care or in foster care or residential facilities, whether it's for their disabilities [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=281.4s)]
*  or for cancer treatment. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=286.52s)]
*  The potential cuts to Medicaid would be devastating to children across the country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  And is there any recourse that these agencies have? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  Are these cuts inevitable and going into effect? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=295.98s)]
*  So it depends on which one. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=299.86s)]
*  The cuts to Head Start and both to staffing and potentially to its funding seem imminent. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=302.3s)]
*  And Head Start programs are already closing in several parts of the country. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=309.98s)]
*  That's probably one of the more imminent ones. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=313.94000000000005s)]
*  The cuts at DOJ for local law enforcement seem like they may happen, but there's a chance [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=315.78000000000003s)]
*  that some of that funding gets reinstated. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=320.48s)]
*  The Department said that they're still considering some of the grants. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=324.7s)]
*  So there's a spectrum. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=328.14s)]
*  Obviously, we know that with Medicaid, that's still up in the air, but it looks like the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=329.14s)]
*  Republicans in Congress are going to be cutting Medicaid soon. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=332.58s)]
*  And you got a response from Robert Kennedy's office, of course, in charge of Health and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=335.02s)]
*  America, saying they're going to put money into establishing MAHA, right, the Administration [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=338.38s)]
*  for Healthy America. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=344.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=345.5s)]
*  They're going to consolidate all these children's programs at the Administration for Children [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=346.5s)]
*  and Families that had run Child Care and Head Start and the child support system. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=350.36s)]
*  It's another big one that the federal government does, that it makes sure that child support [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=355.04s)]
*  payments get to families. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=359.36s)]
*  All of those are going to be reduced and consolidated into this other area. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=361.68s)]
*  Well, Eli Hager, we're going to have to leave it to folks reading your piece. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=364.76s)]
*  Eli Hager is a ProPublica reporter. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=369.24s)]
*  We'll link to his new piece, The Trump Administration's War on Children. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  That does it for our show. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=378.2s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Nermeen Shaikh for another edition of Democracy Now! [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wwfD0qoSg&t=379.2s)]
