# Top U.S. & World Headlines — March 12, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [March 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUbii39oxxw)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Haiti's unelected prime minister, Ariel Henry, has announced he'll resign once a
*  transitional council is established.
*  He made the announcement after Caribbean leaders held an emergency meeting in Jamaica to discuss
*  the crisis in Haiti, where armed groups launched an uprising against Henry last week.
*  U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken attended the meeting and pledged $100 million to help
*  finance the deployment of a multinational force mission to Haiti.
*  Henry announced his plan to resign in a video message posted online.
*  After the Council of Ministers, it's been agreed to set up a presidential transitional
*  council.
*  Once chosen, the council will govern over different sectors of national life.
*  Haiti wants peace.
*  Haiti needs stability.
*  Haiti needs sustainable development.
*  Haiti needs to rebuild democratic institutions.
*  I'm asking all Haitians to remain calm and do everything they can for peace and stability
*  to come back as fast as possible for the good of the country.
*  The Miami Herald is reporting CARICOM has proposed a plan to set up a seven-member presidential
*  that would appoint a new interim prime minister for Haiti.
*  Barbados' Prime Minister Mia Motley said the panel would only include Haitians who
*  support the deployment of a U.N.-backed security force.
*  Last week, Ariel Henry traveled to Kenya, which is slated to lead the security mission,
*  with 1,000 Kenyan police.
*  He's been unable to return home and was reportedly most recently in Puerto Rico.
*  On Monday, one of the leaders of the recent armed uprising in Haiti, Jimmy Charizier,
*  known as Barbecue, warned against outside forces picking Haiti's next leader.
*  We take this opportunity to say to the international community that if it continues down this path,
*  it will plunge Haiti into chaos when it chooses a small group of politicians and negotiates
*  with them on paper to decide who can be president and what kind of government we're going
*  to have.
*  Today it's clear that it's the inhabitants of the working-class districts and the Haitian
*  people who know what they're suffering at the moment, and it's up to them to choose
*  the person who's going to lead them and the way he's going to lead them.
*  We'll have more on Haiti after headlines.
*  Al Jazeera is reporting Israeli forces in Gaza have killed at least 11 people who are
*  waiting for aid in Gaza City.
*  More than 20 injured people were taken to Al-Shifa Hospital.
*  Health officials in Gaza say Israeli forces have killed more than 400 aid seekers in Gaza
*  in recent weeks.
*  This comes as Israel continues to restrict aid coming into Gaza, which is on the brink
*  of famine.
*  The U.N. is reporting one truck was recently denied access to Gaza because it contains
*  scissors inside medical kits.
*  UNREHED Philippe Lazzarini criticized the decision, saying, quote,
*  Medical scissors are now added to a long list of banned items the Israeli authorities classify
*  as for dual use.
*  He went on to write, quote,
*  Meanwhile, an aid ship bound for Gaza has set sail from Cyprus with 200 tons of food
*  supplies.
*  The UAE-funded mission was organized by the two aid groups World Central Kitchen and Open
*  Arms.
*  Inside Gaza, Palestinians mark the first day of Ramadan on Monday.
*  The first day of Ramadan is very tough.
*  We don't know what we're going to cook.
*  What are we going to have for iftar, the meal breaking the fast?
*  Also, at Sahur, the meal before the fast at dawn, we couldn't cook.
*  There's no gas.
*  We get out of the tent in the cold to light the fire, and it's really cold.
*  How are we going to cook?
*  Also, the prices are unimaginable.
*  Prices of the tomato and the potatoes, the prices are high.
*  We can't get meat or chicken.
*  Everything is very expensive.
*  In this situation, we don't want aid.
*  What we want is a ceasefire.
*  On Monday, senior U.S. intelligence officials testified before Congress.
*  The director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, warned the war in Gaza will increase
*  the threat of terrorism for years.
*  Moreover, the crisis has galvanized violence by a range of actors around the world, and
*  while it is too early to tell, it is likely that the Gaza conflict will have a generational
*  impact on terrorism.
*  The Guardian is reporting 12 prominent Israeli human rights organizations have signed an
*  open letter accusing Israel of failing to abide by the ruling of the International Court
*  of Justice to facilitate more humanitarian aid into Gaza.
*  In the letter, the groups wrote, quote, The ICJ order is a legal obligation to end the
*  humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.
*  It must be abided by not only to ease the urgent suffering of civilians, but for the
*  sake of humanity as a whole, they wrote.
*  The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has accused the Israeli military of
*  beating and waterboarding some of its staff held in Israeli prisons.
*  UNRWA states in a new report, quote, Agency staff members have been subject to threats
*  and coercion by the Israeli authorities while in detention and pressured to make false statements
*  against the agency, including that the agency has affiliations with Hamas and that UNRWA
*  staff members took part in the 7 October 2023 atrocities, unquote.
*  UNRWA has faced a crisis ever since Israel accused a number of its staff workers of taking
*  part in the October 7 attacks.
*  Although Israel did not share evidence backing up its claim, many countries, including the
*  United States, cut off funding to UNRWA despite Gaza's catastrophic humanitarian crisis.
*  In recent days, Sweden and Canada resume funding.
*  India has enacted a controversial citizenship law that makes it easier for non-Muslims who
*  have moved to India to become citizens.
*  Under the law, Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Sikhs, Jains and Parsi's, who moved to India
*  before 2015 from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, would become eligible for citizenship.
*  The law excludes Muslim immigrants.
*  The bill's passage in 2019 sparked deadly protests, but the law was not implemented
*  until now, just ahead of a major election, as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks
*  a third term.
*  Amnesty International criticised the law, saying it's, quote, a discriminatory law
*  that goes against the constitutional values of equality and international human rights law.
*  A former manager at Boeing, who became a whistleblower, has been found dead in South Carolina.
*  According to the BBC, John Barnett had given evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against
*  the company in recent days.
*  The Charleston County coroner said Barnett died of a self-inflicted wound on Friday.
*  Barnett had worked at Boeing for 32 years before retiring in 2017.
*  He later spoke to The New York Times about problems at a Boeing South Carolina plant
*  that manufactures the 787 Dreamliner aircraft.
*  On the campaign trail, Donald Trump suggested Monday he's open to cutting spending on
*  Social Security and Medicare.
*  During an interview on CNBC, Trump said, quote, there's a lot you can do in terms of entitlements,
*  in terms of cutting.
*  President Biden responded with a message on social media, saying, quote, not on my watch.
*  Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee has fired over 60 staffers just days after
*  Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, became the RNC new co-chair as the former president
*  strengthens his control of the Republican Party.
*  In other Trump news, the former president is seeking to delay the start of his upcoming
*  hush money trial, which is slated to begin March 25 in New York.
*  Trump's requested the trial wait until the U.S. Supreme Court reviews his immunity claim
*  in another case.
*  Republican Alabama Senator Katie Britt is facing backlash after telling a misleading
*  during her much criticized response to President Biden's State of the Union last week.
*  While criticizing Biden's border policies, Britt told the story of a 12-year-old girl
*  who was sexually trafficked by drug cartels and repeatedly raped.
*  We wouldn't be OK with this happening in a third world country.
*  This is the United States of America, and it is pastime, in my opinion, that we start
*  acting like it.
*  President Biden's border policies are a disgrace.
*  What Senator Britt didn't tell the nation is that the incident took place during the
*  administration of President George W. Bush, that the abuse took place in Mexico, not the
*  United States, and that drug cartels were not involved.
*  The woman who Britt referenced, Carla Jacinto, appeared on CNN over the weekend.
*  Yes.
*  In fact, I hardly ever cooperate with politicians, because it seems to me that they only want
*  an image.
*  They only want a photo.
*  And that, to me, is not fair.
*  I work as a spokesperson for many victims who have no voice, and I really would like
*  them to be empathetic, all the governors, all the senators, to be empathetic with the
*  issue of human trafficking, because there are millions of girls and boys who disappear
*  all the time, people who are really trafficked and abused, as she mentioned.
*  And I think she should first take into account what really happens before telling a story
*  of that magnitude.
*  We'll have more on that story later in the broadcast.
*  In California, a 15-year-old black teenager with autism was shot dead Saturday at his
*  home by a sheriff's deputy.
*  The teenager, Ryan Gaynor, was reportedly holding a gardening tool when he was fatally
*  shot by a deputy from San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.
*  Officers had come to his home after receiving reports of a domestic incident.
*  Attorney DeWitt Lacey said, quote,
*  There are great questions as to whether it was appropriate to use deadly force against
*  a 15-year-old autistic kid who was having an episode.
*  We need to see the video and the moment of the shooting, but it doesn't seem like anyone
*  was in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury, unquote.
*  And in Sweden, police have forcibly removed climate activist Greta Thunberg and dozens
*  of other environmental protesters who were blocking the entrance to the Swedish parliament
*  for a second day.
*  Thunberg spoke at the action.
*  Right now, we are a group of young people who are blocking entrances to the Swedish
*  parliament, the Krikstad, to protest against the ongoing destruction of our life-supporting
*  systems and of people already being killed as a result of the climate crisis.
*  And that needs to come to an end.
*  We have had enough.
*  And those are some of the headlines.

*  I'm Amy Goodman in New York with Democracy Now! co-host Juan González in Chicago.
*  Hi, Juan.
*  Hi, Amy, and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around
*  the world.
*  Thank you.
