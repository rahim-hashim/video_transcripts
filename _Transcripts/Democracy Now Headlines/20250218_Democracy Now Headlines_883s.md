The Israeli-Palestinian film No Other Land is nominated for an Oscar for best documentary at this year's awards, to be held March 2. It follows the struggles of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank community of Masafer Yatta to stay on their land amid violent attacks by Jewish settlers aimed at expelling them. Since the film's nomination was announced in January, that violence has continued, with co-director Basel Adra sharing video on social media of settlers rampaging through the village under the protection of Israeli soldiers. Adra, who joins us from London, says the goal of the documentary was not just winning awards but "to get to the people's hearts" through film. "We want people to see the reality, to see what's going on in my community Masafer Yatta but [also] in all the West Bank."

# Palestinian Director Basel Adra: As "No Other Land" Gets Oscar Nod, Israel Attacks West Bank
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz√°lez. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=11.28s)]
*  We turn now to the Occupied West Bank, where Israel is reportedly planning to build nearly [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=13.44s)]
*  a thousand new settler homes in the Afrat settlement near Jerusalem. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=17.28s)]
*  The Israeli settlements are illegal under international law. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  The group Shalom Achchav, Peace Now, condemned the move, saying the Netanyahu government [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=24.92s)]
*  is trying, quote, to establish facts on the ground that will destroy the chance for peace [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=29.96s)]
*  and compromise, end quote. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=34.68s)]
*  This comes as Israel's ongoing military operations in West Bank have displaced at [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  least 45,000 Palestinians, the most since the 1967 war. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=40.84s)]
*  Today, the Oscar-nominated Palestinian director, Basel Adra, shared video from the Occupied [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  West Bank of Israeli forces storming and demolishing four houses in Masafayat. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=53.34s)]
*  Earlier this month, Basel Adra himself filmed armed and masked Israeli settlers attacking [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=73.26s)]
*  his community of Masafayat. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=81.12s)]
*  The settlers threw stones, smashed vehicles, slashed tires, punctured a water tank. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=84.12s)]
*  Israeli soldiers on the scene did not intervene to halt the crimes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=90.34s)]
*  Basel Adra's Oscar-nominated documentary, No Other Land, is about Israel's mass expulsion [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=94.5s)]
*  of Palestinians living in Masafayat. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=101.66s)]
*  Last week, Basel wrote, quote, anyone who cared about No Other Land should care about [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=106.02s)]
*  what's actually happening on the ground. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  Today, our water tanks, nine homes, three ancient caves were destroyed. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=114.44s)]
*  Masafayat is disappearing in front of my eyes. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=119.16s)]
*  Only one name for these actions, ethnic cleansing, he said. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=122.5s)]
*  In a minute, Basel Adra will join us for an update, but first we want to play the trailer [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=128.01999999999998s)]
*  from his Oscar-nominated documentary, No Other Land. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=133.08s)]
*  My name is Basel. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=164.08s)]
*  Masafir Yatta is the place I grew up in. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=166.08s)]
*  The beginning of photography is the beginning of our end. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=170.08s)]
*  Are you ready? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=176.08s)]
*  I'm not afraid! [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=182.08s)]
*  To the West. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=193.08s)]
*  He's from 1948. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=202.08s)]
*  No, he's Jewish. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=204.08s)]
*  Yes, brother! [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=206.08s)]
*  There's a sound coming out. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=208.08s)]
*  It's not just people sitting here, it's not just human beings. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=210.08s)]
*  They entered? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=216.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=218.08s)]
*  Did they get in? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=220.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=221.08s)]
*  This is what's happening in my village now. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=222.08s)]
*  Soldiers are everywhere. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=224.08s)]
*  Help me, God willing. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=226.08s)]
*  It would be nice if you could come and visit me. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=237.08s)]
*  Then you can come and visit me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=242.08s)]
*  Not that I'm visiting you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=244.08s)]
*  Or not? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=247.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=248.08s)]
*  I'll shoot you a kid. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=250.08s)]
*  The one who can shoot you. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=251.08s)]
*  That's the trailer for the Oscar-nominated documentary No Other Land, co-directed by the Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham and our next guest Basel Adra, Palestinian activist and journalist who writes for 972 Magazine. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=259.08000000000004s)]
*  Basel, in his most recent piece, headlined, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=275.08s)]
*  Our film is going to the Oscars, but here in Masafir Yata, we're still being erased. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=278.08s)]
*  Basel has spent years documenting Israeli efforts to evict Palestinians living in his community, Masafir Yata, south of Hebron. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=284.08s)]
*  Basel, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=293.08s)]
*  If you can talk about your film and also what's happening right now, this is not a film about history. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=295.08s)]
*  It's on the ground now. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=302.08s)]
*  You recently were barricaded in your house filming what was going on, what the Israeli settlers were doing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=304.08s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=312.08s)]
*  Yeah, our movie, we worked in it for the last five years. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=314.08s)]
*  We are four people, two Israelis and two Palestinians, me, myself, Yuval and Rachel and Hamdan, who's my friend and living in Masafir Yata. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=318.08s)]
*  We're just activists and journalists. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=327.08s)]
*  Me and my friend Hamdan spent years in the field running after bulldozers, soldiers and settlers in our communities and communities around us filming the destruction, the home destruction, the school destruction, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=330.08s)]
*  the cutting of our water pipes and the bulldozing of our roads and our own schools and trying to raise awareness from the international community on what's going on to get political impact, to try to stop this from happening and to protect our community. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=345.08s)]
*  And five years ago, Yuval and Rachel joined as Israeli journalists to write about what's happening. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=365.08s)]
*  And then we decided together that we will start working on No Other Land as a documentary that shows the whole political story through personal, individual stories of people who lost their life and homes and school and properties on this, like in the last years. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=372.08s)]
*  And also in the decades of the occupation, we released the movie in the Berlin Alley 2024 last year, the festival. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=394.08s)]
*  And so far, it's been like doing and screened and showed like in many festivals around the world. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=404.08s)]
*  And Basil, your film has received an Oscar nomination, but you haven't been able to find a distributor in the U.S. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=412.08s)]
*  What do you know about this refusal of any company to pick up your film to distribute? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=421.08s)]
*  And also, can it be seen in the West Bank or in Israel itself? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=427.08s)]
*  I mean, it's sad that we don't find a U.S. distributor. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=434.08s)]
*  Our goal from making this documentary, it's not the awards itself, but the people and the audience and to get to the people's hearts, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=439.08s)]
*  because we want people to see the reality, to see what's going on in my community, in Masaf Riyatta, but in all the West Bank, to the Palestinians and how the life, the daily life under this brutal occupation, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=448.08s)]
*  people should be aware of this because they are in somehow they have responsibility. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=462.08s)]
*  In the U.S., it's the tax money that the people paying there, it's have something to do with the home destruction that we're facing, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=468.08s)]
*  the settlers' veil and the building of the settlements on our land that does not stop every day. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=478.08s)]
*  And we as a collective made this movie. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=484.08s)]
*  We faced so many risks on the field, on the ground. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=487.08s)]
*  Like my home was invaded and the cameras were confiscated from my home by Israeli soldiers. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=492.08s)]
*  And I was physically attacked on the field when I'm going around and filming these crimes. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=497.08s)]
*  I mean, to show to the people and to let the people know about what's going on. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=503.08s)]
*  But it's sad that the distributors in the U.S. so far do not want to take a little bit of risk, political risk, and to show this documentary to the audience. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=507.08s)]
*  I'm really sad about it that there is no big distributor is taking no other land and showing to the American people. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=518.08s)]
*  It's very important to reach to the Americans, I believe. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=526.08s)]
*  And so far we are doing it independently on the cinemas. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=530.08s)]
*  And your co-director is Israeli. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=535.08s)]
*  Have you come under criticism for working with Israelis on the film? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=538.08s)]
*  So far I'm not receiving any criticism for working with the Israelis. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=543.08s)]
*  Like working together is because we share in somehow the same values that we reject the injustice and the occupation and the apartheid of what's going on. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=550.08s)]
*  And we want to work pro-solution and pro-justice and to end these settlements and for a better future. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=562.08s)]
*  Basel, the Oscars are soon, in a few weeks. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=571.08s)]
*  Can you get a visa to come into the United States? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=575.08s)]
*  Will you attend the Oscars? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=577.08s)]
*  So I have visa so far because I've been in the U.S. participating in festivals for our movie. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=580.08s)]
*  But my family and other Palestinian co-directors does not have yet. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=588.08s)]
*  And they will try to apply soon. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=591.08s)]
*  And hopefully they will get it and they will be able to join us in the Oscar. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=594.08s)]
*  So since it's so difficult to see your film here in the United States, I want to go to another clip of No Other Land. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=599.08s)]
*  Again, this is our guest, Basel Adra, and his co-director, Yuval Abraham, filming the eviction of a Palestinian family. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=605.08s)]
*  Now the soldiers arrive here. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=629.08s)]
*  He's... [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=638.08s)]
*  Come on. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=659.08s)]

*  Come on. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=677.08s)]
*  Come on. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=680.08s)]
*  Come on. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=683.08s)]
*  That's Israeli bulldozers destroying a bathroom. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=687.08s)]
*  This is another clip from No Other Land in which you, Basel, are attacked by Israeli forces, even as you try to show them you have media credentials. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=691.08s)]
*  I'm filming you. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=699.08s)]
*  I'm filming you. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=705.08s)]
*  I'm doing my job. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=708.08s)]
*  You're saying that people have a right to... [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=710.08s)]
*  To stop... [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=712.08s)]
*  Is there a good one? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=713.08s)]
*  To stop. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=715.08s)]

*  Come on, get him on the road. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=718.08s)]
*  Is there a good one? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=720.08s)]
*  Come on. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=722.08s)]
*  I have a gun. Give it to me. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=724.08s)]
*  Is, you're hurting me. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=731.08s)]
*  Wait. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqfnv9fCNC4&t=733.08s)]
