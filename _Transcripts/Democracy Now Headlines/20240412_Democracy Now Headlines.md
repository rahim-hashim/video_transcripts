# Top U.S. & World Headlines — April 12, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPta6DUU9GA)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israeli attacks across Gaza have killed dozens of Palestinians over the past day, including
*  in the Nusayrat refugee camp, Gaza City and Raqqa.
*  Palestinian officials say an Israeli airstrike killed Ridwan Ridwan, the head of the Jabalia
*  Camp's police force, who oversaw the safe travel of aid truck convoys in northern Gaza.
*  Like much of the Gaza Strip, Jabalia has been left in utter ruins by Israel.
*  Children are forced to play among the rubble.
*  We built this game because all of our toys have been destroyed and our houses have been
*  destroyed and there's nothing for us to play with except this pipe.
*  As you can see here at the Jabalia refugee camp, mass destruction, there isn't an atmosphere
*  of Eid or the joy that comes with it.
*  As you can see, children are playing on the rubble and rocks, and I am entertaining them.
*  On Wednesday, Samantha Power, head of USAID, became the first top Biden administration
*  official to publicly acknowledge famine is present in northern Gaza.
*  She was questioned by House Democrat Joaquin Castro during a congressional hearing.
*  So there's famine is already occurring there?
*  That is—
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  House Democrat Joaquin Castro then asked Samantha Power how many children were at risk of dying
*  in the coming weeks due to famine in Gaza.
*  In northern Gaza, the rate of malnutrition prior to October 7th was almost zero, and
*  it is now one in three—one in three kids.
*  The Biden administration sent top military commander, General Michael Correa, to Israel
*  and his restricted travel for its embassy staff in Israel, as fears mount over a possible
*  Iranian attack.
*  The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday an attack in Israel could come by Saturday,
*  though another unnamed source says Tehran has not made any final decisions.
*  Iranian leadership vowed to retaliate following last week's Israeli attack on the diplomatic
*  in Damascus, Syria, which killed top Iranian military officials, including Mohammed Reza
*  Zahedi, a senior commander in the Al Quds Force.
*  In Morocco, an activist was sentenced to five years in prison this week for criticizing
*  Morocco's 2020 decision to normalize relations with Israel.
*  Abdulrahman Zankad was arrested last month after posting on Facebook his criticism.
*  Mexico has filed a complaint with the International Court of Justice and requested the U.N. expel
*  Ecuador as tensions between the two nations rise.
*  Last week, Ecuadorian police and military raided the Mexican embassy in Quito to arrest
*  former leftist Ecuadorian Vice President Jorge Glas.
*  He had been taking refuge at the embassy since December to avoid arrest on corruption
*  charges, which he and allies say are politically motivated.
*  This is Mexico's foreign secretary, Alicia Bárcena.
*  ALICIA BÁRCENA, Foreign Secretary, Mexico is accusing Ecuador of violating the diplomatic
*  immunity of its embassy, and this is extremely serious, regardless of the cause.
*  The fact that they have raided the embassy in a violent manner with police and military
*  forces is a violation and justified anywhere.
*  Ukraine passed a bill overhauling the military draft as a general warned lawmakers Russian
*  forces outnumbered Ukrainian troops tenfold in the east.
*  The new measures seek to increase troops by requiring eligible men update their draft
*  data with authorities, increasing compensation for volunteers and allowing some people with
*  convictions to serve.
*  It also does not set an upper limit for wartime military service.
*  Lawmakers, however, were forced to remove some of the harshest draft dodging penalties
*  after public backlash.
*  Family members of deployed soldiers protested the bill near the parliament in Kyiv Thursday.
*  ALICIA BÁRCENA, Foreign Secretary, Mexico Our boys and girls in the service are very
*  tired.
*  They have been fighting for two years, and no one is planning to replace them.
*  For rotation to happen, newcomers have to know how much time they will have to spend
*  at the front line.
*  Undefined mobilization terms mean fighting forever.
*  Without strictly defined terms, no one will join the army.
*  The measure comes over two years into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and as Russian forces
*  step up their attacks, Russia launched over 40 missiles and 40 drones at Ukrainian energy
*  sources and critical infrastructure overnight Thursday, destroying at least one large electricity
*  plant.
*  We will have more on Ukraine later in the broadcast.
*  Polish lawmakers have begun debating reforms to Poland's near-total abortion ban, more
*  than three years after mass protests against the ban rocked Poland.
*  Poland's liberal new prime minister, Donald Tusk, pledged to bring abortion rights back,
*  but his wide-ranging political coalition remains deeply divided on the issue.
*  This is Dorota Oko of the Left Together Party.
*  DOROTA OKO, Polish Prime Minister, Poland Removing the provisions on imprisonments for
*  assisting in abortion from the penal code is the first necessary step to the safety
*  of pregnant women in our country.
*  The place of abortion is in the medical textbook, not in the criminal code.
*  President Biden today announced another $7.4 billion in federal student loan relief.
*  Around 277,000 borrowers will see their debt canceled as part of regulatory updates to
*  existing programs.
*  The new push will mostly benefit borrowers enrolled in the SAVE, an income-driven repayment
*  plan which relieves debt after at least 10 years of repayments.
*  The Biden administration finalized a rule closing the gun show loophole.
*  Vendors who sell firearms online at gun shows and through private purchases will now be
*  required to conduct background checks on buyers.
*  The change is expected to affect over 20,000 people who currently deal in unlicensed firearm
*  sales.
*  The rule will also be required to register with the government.
*  Far-right House conservatives blocked legislation that would extend warrantless surveillance
*  after Donald Trump directed them to, quote, kill it.
*  The move was in defiance of embattled House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has now failed three
*  times to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.
*  In Mississippi, six white former sheriff's deputies, who belong to the self-described
*  Goon Squad, have each been sentenced in state court to 15 to 45 years in prison for raiding
*  a home and torturing two black men.
*  They'll serve the state's sentences concurrently with their federal sentences, which were handed
*  down last month and ranged between 10 and 40 years in prison.
*  To see our full coverage of this story, including interviews with the survivors, Michael Jenkins
*  and Eddie Parker, go to democracynow.org.
*  In Australia, conservationists warn the Great Barrier Reef could be suffering its most severe
*  coral bleaching ever.
*  Some 75 percent of the reef has bleached in the fifth such event in eight years, which
*  are increasing with global heating.
*  Coral reefs are key to maintaining marine biodiversity, as thousands of underwater creatures
*  depend on them for survival, including fish, sea turtles, seabirds, jellyfish, among many
*  more.
*  They also protect coastal areas from major storm surges and provide livelihoods and nourishment
*  for surrounding communities and beyond.
*  And in Nigeria, communities are marking 10 years since the mass kidnapping of 276 girls
*  from their school dormitory in Chibok by Boko Haram fighters.
*  Negotiations in 2016 and 17 led to the release of about 100 of the girls by Nigerian and
*  international leaders have since ceased campaigning for the release of the remaining captives,
*  as mass kidnappings continue to plague Nigeria.
*  Their families and freed survivors are demanding their safe return.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
