# Top U.S. & World Headlines — September 18, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2UXzxtkZPA)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In Lebanon, at least 12 people were killed, nearly 3,000 people injured Tuesday afternoon
*  when electronic pagers used by members of Hezbollah exploded at the same time, at 3
*  30 in the afternoon.
*  The simultaneous blasts out of fear and panic in Beirut and across southern Lebanon and
*  left hospitals overwhelmed.
*  Hezbollah blamed Israel vowed to retaliate, raising fears of a broader regional war.
*  Reuters reports Israel's Mossad spy agency managed to plant explosive devices in pagers
*  bought in recent months by Hezbollah from a company in Taiwan.
*  Victims of the attack included a 10-year-old girl named Fatima Jafar Abdullah, who was
*  killed when her father's pager exploded.
*  Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mujtaba Amani, lost an eye to an exploding pager.
*  Hezbollah relied on pagers for communication, in part to avoid Israel's surveillance of
*  other communication networks.
*  Lebanese lawmakers condemned the attack as an act of terrorism, after headlines will
*  go to Beirut, to Geneva and Boston for the latest.
*  Top Biden administration officials quickly distance themselves from Tuesday's pager
*  attack in Lebanon.
*  This is State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.
*  I can tell you that the U.S. was not involved in it.
*  The U.S. was not aware of this incident in advance, and at this point we're gathering
*  information.
*  On Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris defended the Biden administration's support of Israel
*  throughout its assault on Gaza.
*  During an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Harris
*  also cited her support for President Biden's decision in May to temporarily pause the delivery
*  of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel.
*  Harris was questioned by reporter Eugene Daniels of Politico.
*  But what do you say to those that say that's not enough, that stopping the 2,000-pound
*  bombs the one time wasn't enough, that this administration and your possible administration
*  has to do more?
*  Well, we are doing the work of putting the pressure on all parties involved to get the
*  deal done.
*  But let me be very clear also.
*  I support Israel's ability to defend itself.
*  Just last month, the Biden administration approved $20 billion in additional weapons
*  sales to Israel, including advanced air-to-air missiles and fighter jets.
*  In Gaza, at least 20 Palestinians have been killed and 54 wounded over the past 24 hours,
*  including at least eight people who were killed in an Israeli airstrike targeting a school,
*  sheltering displaced civilians in Gaza City's Shijia neighborhood.
*  Another attack on a civilian car near Rafa in southern Gaza killed two Palestinians and
*  wounded several others.
*  The United Nations is warning Burma is plumbing the depths of a human rights abyss as the
*  military regime intensifies the killings and arbitrary arrests of tens of thousands
*  of civilians since seizing power in a coup over three years ago.
*  The gruesome findings were part of a new report by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights,
*  which detailed that many of those detained by the Burmese military are children taken
*  from their parents.
*  Dozens of those children have died in custody.
*  This is U.N. Rights Office spokesperson Liz Throssel.
*  Since the coup on the 1st of February 2021, at least 5,350 civilians have been killed,
*  more than 3.3 million displaced and over half the population are living below the poverty
*  line, primarily due to military violence.
*  Lawmakers in the Republic of Georgia have approved legislation to begin a sweeping crackdown
*  on LGBTQIA people and organizations.
*  The so-called Family Values and the Protection of Minors Law, approved Tuesday, will outlaw
*  Pride events, LGBTQ plus gatherings and even displays of rainbow flags.
*  Tamar Jakeli is director of Tbilisi Pride in Georgia's capital.
*  Our main aim was always to be very outspoken and loud on LGBTQ issues.
*  We, every year we used to hold a Pride week.
*  We tried to hold Pride marches.
*  We held successfully Pride festivals, conferences and film screenings.
*  And now we are already at the risk that we cannot hold any events really.
*  And this law will make it legally impossible, not just physically and politically impossible,
*  but also legally.
*  Back in the United States, Republican senators have once again blocked legislation that would
*  protect access to in vitro fertilization and require health insurers to cover the fertility
*  treatment.
*  The Right to IVF Act was sponsored by Illinois Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, who personally
*  struggled to become pregnant before turning to IVF to conceive her children.
*  Now, that freedom to get reproductive care is at risk for millions of other women whose
*  most desperate hope in the world is to have a little one of their own.
*  Make no mistake, that isn't some future nightmare.
*  This is our present reality.
*  In more reproductive rights news, ProPublica reports at least two women in Georgia died
*  after they could not access legal abortions and timely Medicare in their state.
*  Amber Thurman suffered a fatal infection after doctors refused to treat a rare complication
*  from a medication abortion.
*  And Candy Miller died from medication abortion complications after her family said she didn't
*  visit a doctor, quote, due to the current legislation on pregnancies and abortions.
*  We'll have more on this story later in the broadcast.
*  In Texas, hundreds of homes remain under evacuation orders in the Houston suburb of Deer Park,
*  more than two days after an SUV struck a pipeline valve station, triggering a massive explosion
*  that rattled homes and businesses, sending a column of fire and smoke into the sky that
*  was visible more than 10 miles away.
*  The pipeline, containing natural gas liquids, burned for a second straight day and into
*  the night Tuesday.
*  Here in New York, music mogul Sean Diddy Combs was denied bail and remained in jail until
*  his trial after pleading not guilty Tuesday to racketeering, conspiracy, sex trafficking
*  and other charges.
*  Prosecutors accused Combs of repeatedly assaulting several women, drugging and coercing women
*  and men to perform sexual acts, and being part of a criminal organization that engaged
*  in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery and other crimes since at least
*  2008.
*  He'll appear in court again today.
*  In Atlanta, prosecutors on Tuesday dropped all money laundering charges against three
*  activists who are accused of misusing a bail fund to support protests against Cop City,
*  a multi-million dollar police training complex that will be the largest in the country.
*  Atlanta Solidarity Fund organizers Marlon Coutts, Adele McLean and Savannah Patterson
*  are still facing racketeering charges as part of a sweeping RICO case that includes at least
*  58 other Stop Cop City activists indicted last year.
*  Coutts celebrated the victory writing in a statement, quote,
*  From the beginning we knew these charges were not based on any evidence but were instead
*  politically motivated and intended to target a social movement, they said.
*  And in Washington, D.C., the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the rise of anti-Muslim
*  and anti-Semitic hate crimes across the United States.
*  Republican senators used the forum to condemn recent student-led pro-Palestine protests
*  at university campuses across the country and lashed out at the hearing's Arab-American
*  witness Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab-American Institute.
*  This is Louisiana Republican Senator John Kennedy questioning Berry.
*  I think it's exceptionally disappointing that you're looking at an Arab-American
*  witness before you and saying you support Hamas.
*  You know what's disappointing to me?
*  I do not support Hamas.
*  You can't bring yourself to say you don't support UNRWA.
*  You don't support Hamas.
*  You don't support—
*  I was very clear on my support for UNRWA.
*  I oppose—
*  As Boa and you don't support UNRWA, you should hide your head in a bag.
*  Don't you ask the Louisiana Senator John Kennedy repeatedly as he conflated the United
*  Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, UNRWA, with Hamas.
*  Following that exchange, committee chair, Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, gave Maya
*  Berry a chance to respond.
*  It's regrettable that I, as I sit here, have experienced the very issue that we're
*  attempting to deal with today.
*  The introduction of foreign policy is not how we keep Arab-Americans or Jewish-Americans
*  or Muslim-Americans or black people or Asian-Americans, anybody safe.
*  This has been regrettably a real disappointment, but very much an indication of the danger
*  to our democratic institutions that we're in now.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
