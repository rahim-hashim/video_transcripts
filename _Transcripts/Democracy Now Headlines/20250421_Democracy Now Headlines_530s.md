Pope Francis has died at the age of 88. The Argentinian-born Jesuit had led the Catholic Church since 2013, when he made history by becoming the first pope from Latin America. Francis was a vocal champion for the poor and marginalized, migrants’ rights, and often spoke out about the climate crisis. “When he addressed almost any issue, he would begin with the experience of people at the margins,” says Marie Dennis, director of the Catholic Nonviolence Initiative.

*  We welcome you all to Democracy Now! [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=240.24s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  Marie Dennis, let's begin with you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=244.92s)]
*  The life and legacy of the pope, if you can talk about it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=247.32s)]
*  Yes, thank you so much. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  What a gift he has been over these years. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=254.68s)]
*  From the very beginning, both his way of life, his own witness and his words have pointed [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=257.64s)]
*  in the direction of peace, of mercy, of nonviolence. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=265.28s)]
*  Pope Francis, as we, many of us, remember, immediately after he was elected, gestured [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=271.4s)]
*  by even what shoes he was going to wear and by where he was going to live and by what [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=280.67999999999995s)]
*  car he was going to ride in, his own personal commitment to be close to those who were poor [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=286.08s)]
*  and marginalized in our world. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=293.4s)]
*  And he has continued that throughout his papacy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=295.35999999999996s)]
*  Talk about where he took the church when it came to LGBTQ issues, when it came to abortion. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  He just went to a prison to visit with prisoners, apologized for not washing their feet on Thursday, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=307.2s)]
*  but said he was not well. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  If you can talk about all these issues. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=315.96s)]
*  Of course. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  Pope Francis, I think it's important to begin by saying that Pope Francis began when he [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  addressed almost any issue, he would begin with experience, with the experience of people [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=329.04s)]
*  at the margins who were on the receiving end of whatever form of violence or rejection [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=335.6s)]
*  was being exercised. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=343.48s)]
*  So for example, with migrants, his first gesture was to go to meet with migrants, to understand [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=345.6s)]
*  their journeys, to understand what motivated them to leave home. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=355.6s)]
*  When he was challenged by those who were abused by priests and others in the church, he listened [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=360.64000000000004s)]
*  to the survivors of that abuse. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=369.72s)]
*  He listened to LGBTQ representatives, people who were on the receiving end of the exclusion [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=373.32000000000005s)]
*  of LGBTQ in our church. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  And he began to shift, to both shift his own understanding of a particular situation and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=385.72s)]
*  to begin to change practice in the church. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=392.2s)]
*  I think his consistent commitment was to life, but he described that broadly. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=394.44s)]
*  He talked about violence, the violences that were done to destroy life that were multifaceted, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=403.16s)]
*  as you said, beginning with war, with overt violence, with exclusion of migrants and on [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=412.4s)]
*  and on. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=419.84s)]
*  So he did not limit the church's understanding of commitment to life to only the issue of [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=420.84s)]
*  abortion, but stretched our imagination to understand that to protect life meant to promote [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=430.32s)]
*  a world of peace, of justice, and to find nonviolent ways to move into the future. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=439.36s)]
*  And women. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=446.24s)]
*  Yes, and women. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=447.72s)]
*  Pope Francis, as is often the case, Pope Francis began to listen to women, to hear the experience [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=450.72s)]
*  And he took some quite significant steps to move women into positions of leadership in [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=461.36s)]
*  the institutional church, very high-level positions, which was significant in the Catholic [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=471.12s)]
*  Church. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=476.72s)]
*  He was not yet ready to talk about women's ordination or to make a change in terms of [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=478.08000000000004s)]
*  ordination of women in the Catholic Church. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=485.0s)]
*  But he, especially during the very large synod process where people from around the world [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=487.24s)]
*  were invited to share their experience and their opinions, he listened carefully, I think, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=494.8s)]
*  to the insistence of women around the world that we needed to be fully a part of the leadership [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=502.1s)]
*  in the church. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=511.76s)]
*  So, some small steps in that direction. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=513.68s)]
*  At least a door was open. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQCCETQhg4&t=516.5s)]
