# Top U.S. & World Headlines — October 17, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nZJEsg1QT4)
*  NARMEEN SHAIKH, WJBK reporter, The War and Peace Report.
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Narmeen Shaikh.
*  Israel's two-week-long siege on northern Gaza continues.
*  Rescue workers say dozens of bodies remain buried under collapsed buildings in Jabalia,
*  where Israelis strikes earlier today on a U.N.-run school sheltering displaced Palestinians
*  killed at least 19 people, including children.
*  Hospitals warn food and fuel is running out.
*  Dr. Hossam Abu Safia, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, recorded this video late last night.
*  The nursery is full of cases.
*  They are critical cases in nature.
*  This baby here was only a few hours old when his mother was targeted right after giving
*  birth, so his mother, father and grandmother were martyred.
*  This baby is now alone and has an injury to his head, which led to a secondary infection,
*  and now he is receiving the needed treatment.
*  At the U.N. Security Council Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield suggested
*  the U.S. would start to demand evidence from Israel.
*  It is not intentionally starving Palestinians.
*  Policy of starvation in northern Gaza would be horrific and unacceptable and would have
*  implications under international law and U.S. law.
*  The government of Israel has said that this is not their policy, that food and other essential
*  supplies will not be cut off, and we will be watching to see that Israel's actions
*  on the ground match this statement.
*  This comes as a new report by Politico reveals a top Biden administration official told aid
*  groups in late August that the U.S. would not restrict arms and funding to Israel, even
*  if Israel blocked food and other aid from entering Gaza.
*  These grand Biden special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues reportedly told
*  the heads of over a dozen aid groups the U.S. would never, quote, hold anything back that
*  Israel wants, unquote.
*  Inside Gaza, Palestinians say Israel's deliberate manmade famine has been evident for months.
*  This is Karam Safi, a displaced Palestinian in Khan Yunus, who's been working with aid
*  groups to provide food to up to 16,000 people.
*  KARAM SAFI, Palestinian Spokesman, Qamish
*  Due to the closure of the aid crossings and the permanent siege of the north and south,
*  we were compelled to distribute these lentils, and with very simple resources and capabilities
*  so that we can serve these people.
*  I expect a very big catastrophe, a very big catastrophe, I mean of a special kind.
*  Why?
*  Because most of the adults and children will die of hunger, and the Israelis are doing
*  this intentionally.
*  They are carrying out the siege to kill the people one way or another, not by strikes,
*  but by famine.
*  The goal is to humiliate the Palestinian people.
*  Meanwhile, Anra, which has been defunded by the U.S. since January, is warning it may
*  soon no longer be able to function.
*  ANRAH KHADI, Palestinian Spokesman, Qamish And I will not hide the fact that we might
*  reach a point that we won't be able anymore to operate.
*  And if we cannot operate anymore in Gaza, it's not just UNO as the main provider of
*  services, but you have also the rest of the U.N. system, which very much rely and depends
*  on the platform that the agency has offered so far.
*  So we are very near to a possible breaking point.
*  When will it be?
*  I don't know, but we are very near of that.
*  The airstrikes have hit eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.
*  Shortly after, Israeli forces warned residents it will attack the region.
*  Before the latest warning, 25 percent of Lebanon was already under forced evacuation orders
*  from Israel.
*  Meanwhile, the U.N. interim force in Lebanon reports its peacekeepers have once again come
*  under quote, direct and apparently deliberate fire, unquote, in southern Lebanon.
*  We'll go to Beirut to speak to journalist Rania Abou Zaid after headlines.
*  Meanwhile, Syrian media reports at least two people were injured when Israel launched an
*  airstrike on the port city of Latakia.
*  This comes as the Pentagon announced U.S. B-2 bombers launched so-called precision strikes
*  against five Houthi targets in Yemen.
*  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the attacks are in response to Houthi's quote, destabilizing
*  behavior.
*  Houthi fighters have attacked vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden since November
*  and vowed to continue until Israel ends its assault on Gaza and Lebanon.
*  Kamala Harris has appeared for the first time on Fox News just weeks ahead of the November
*  election.
*  In what was widely described as a combative interview with Brett Baer on Wednesday evening,
*  Harris asserted her administration will break from the Biden presidency.
*  My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency.
*  Like every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional
*  experiences and fresh and new ideas.
*  I represent a new generation of leadership.
*  On foreign policy, Harris called Iran the greatest threat to the U.S. and touted ongoing
*  U.S. weapons shipments to Israel.
*  Harris also defended her hardline stance on immigration.
*  I do not believe in decriminalizing border crossings, and I've not done that as vice
*  president.
*  I will not do that as president.
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has laid out a so-called victory plan in a speech
*  to Ukraine's parliament, proposing to end Russia's war in Ukraine by late 2025.
*  The five-point plan calls for an immediate and unconditional invitation to Ukraine to
*  join NATO.
*  It would also guarantee weapons sent to Ukraine by its allies could be used for attacks on
*  Russian soil and would see Ukrainian troops replace U.S. troops in Europe after the war.
*  Russia's foreign ministry condemned Zelenskyy's plan as an escalation and warned it could
*  push Russia into direct conflict with NATO.
*  This comes as President Biden heads to Germany today, where he'll discuss U.S. and European
*  support for Ukraine.
*  The Wall Street Journal recently reported the number of Ukrainians and Russians killed
*  or wounded since Russia's invasion in early 2022 has topped one million people.
*  An Italian naval vessel carrying 16 asylum seekers who were intercepted in international
*  waters docked in Albania Wednesday, the first in a highly contested new plan by Italy to
*  transfer refugees to Albania while their cases are being processed.
*  Rights groups say the policy likely violates international law.
*  This is Georgia Linaridi with the rescue organization SeaWatch.
*  The Italy-Albania plan is a way to circumvent responsibilities on asylum.
*  It's yet another attempt to militarize borders and to delegate responsibilities over the
*  protection of people on the move to other states to make sure that the eyes of the justice
*  system and of the civil society cannot monitor, denounce, and protect those people.
*  It's clearly not a question of space.
*  There is no need for Italy to go and build extremely costly detention centers in another
*  state.
*  In Nigeria, at least 153 people were killed Tuesday when a fuel tanker exploded in the
*  northern town of Maggia.
*  Another hundred people were injured.
*  The blast occurred as people gathered around an overturned tanker to collect the spilled
*  gasoline.
*  It was one of the deadliest road-related accidents ever recorded in Nigeria.
*  In Mexico, the mayor of Candeleria, Los Hichas, in Oaxaca state died after he was attacked
*  outside his home Tuesday.
*  Román Ruiz Bojerquez is the second Mexican mayor to be assassinated this month.
*  Mexico's recently inaugurated president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has vowed to tackle violent organized
*  crime.
*  Community members mourned Bojerquez at his funeral Wednesday.
*  Today, they killed a leader who only had the aspiration to make his community shine, his
*  town, Candeleria, Los Hichas.
*  On behalf of all of my colleagues, I ask for justice for his death, that it does not go
*  unpunished.
*  Here in New York, a federal district judge on Wednesday sentenced Mexico's former top
*  security official to more than 38 years in prison following his conviction last year
*  for accepting millions of dollars in bribes from the drug cartels he'd been tasked with
*  prosecuting.
*  Hennado Garcia Luna served as Mexico's secretary of public security under former president
*  Felipe Calderón, the architect of Mexico's U.S.-backed so-called war on drugs, which
*  has led to the killing and disappearance of tens of thousands of people.
*  Garcia Luna also worked closely with U.S. counter-narcotics and intelligence agencies.
*  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has denied an 11th hour request by death row prisoner
*  Robert Robertson to halt his planned execution today, despite evidence his 2003 conviction
*  for the murder of his two-year-old daughter was based on quote junk science.
*  Unless Texas Governor Greg Abbott or the U.S. Supreme Court intervene, Robertson is set
*  to be executed at 6 p.m. this evening.
*  The appeals court ruling came even after a bipartisan group of lawmakers requested a
*  stay of execution, writing, quote, We believe it would be a stain on the conscience of the
*  state of Texas for an execution to proceed while efforts are underway to remedy deficiencies
*  in how the law was applied to this case.
*  Robertson's conviction was solely based on forensic testimony that cited the, quote,
*  shaken baby syndrome hypothesis, which was popularized in the early 2000s but never scientifically
*  validated.
*  The Supreme Court has left in place an environmental protection agency rule curbing carbon dioxide
*  emissions by coal and gas-fired power plants.
*  In a brief ruling handed down Wednesday, justices rejected an emergency request by states and
*  fossil fuel industry groups to block the EPA from enforcing rules the agency says will
*  prevent carbon pollution equivalent to the annual emissions of some 330 million gasoline-powered
*  cars.
*  The case now heads back to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
*  In California, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has agreed to an $880 million
*  settlement with 1,353 people who survived sexual abuse by priests.
*  It's the largest settlement of its kind in the U.S., made possible by changes to California
*  law that lifted the statute of limitations on civil cases brought by survivors of child
*  sexual abuse.
*  And in Puerto Rico, Congress members Nidia Velasquez and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez formally
*  endorsed the candidates of the Puerto Rican Center Left Alliance, known as the Alianza,
*  ahead of November's election.
*  The Alianza, which brings together the Puerto Rican Independence Party and the Citizens
*  Victory Party, has appealed to Puerto Ricans disaffected with the two main parties over
*  corruption scandals, austerity policies and the disastrous privatization of the electrical
*  grid.
*  New York Congress member Nidia Velasquez, the first Puerto Rican woman to serve in Congress,
*  spoke Wednesday from Puerto Rico as she endorsed Alianza and its candidate for governor, Juan
*  Dalmau.
*  NIDIA VELASQUEZ, Puerto Rican Congress Member If political parties with different positions
*  dare to make an alliance to fight for a change in Puerto Rico, the logical step for me is
*  to support them.
*  Today in front of the sun, I welcome hope and give my endorsement to Juan Dalmau for
*  governor of Puerto Rico, Anna Irma Rivera-Lassen for commissioner in Washington, Manuel Natal
*  for mayor of San Juan, and the rest of the candidates of the alliance.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
