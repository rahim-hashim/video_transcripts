Hundreds of members of Jewish Voice for Peace in New York protested outside of the office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Monday on the third night of the major Jewish holiday Passover. They gathered in support of a growing number of immigrant activists who have been taken prisoner by ICE, including New York residents Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi, both Palestinian participants of pro-Palestine protests at Columbia University last year. Democracy Now! spoke to some of the Passover Seder attendees. "I've always thought of Passover as a celebration of liberation. And liberation can never be just the Jews," said protester Marianne Pita. "The only way to fight for liberation is to fight for everybody."

# Liberation Seder: Hundreds of Jewish Protesters Demand Release of Foreign Students Abducted by ICE
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q)
*  On the third evening of the Jewish holiday of Passover, Jewish Voice for Peace held a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=0.0s)]
*  protest satyr outside the New York City immigration offices after ICE sees yet another Palestinian [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=5.92s)]
*  Columbia University student with a green card. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=12.68s)]
*  Mohsen Madhawi, a co-founder of Palestinian Student Union at Columbia with Mahmoud Khalil, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=16.44s)]
*  also a Palestinian green card holder, just like Khalil. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=23.84s)]
*  These are some of the voices from Monday's night's protest, including the lawyer who [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=28.8s)]
*  represents Khalil and also the Tufts University graduate student Ramesa Ozturk, who was taken [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=33.36s)]
*  by ICE agents who were masked last month in Somerville, Massachusetts, just outside Tufts. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=41.0s)]
*  But we begin with a member of Jewish Voice for Peace. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=48.32s)]
*  Free Mahmoud! Free them all! [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=51.800000000000004s)]
*  Free Mahmoud! Free them all! [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=54.88s)]
*  Come for one! Face us all! [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=57.88s)]
*  Come for one! Face us all! [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=60.84s)]
*  My name is Mary Ann Pita. I'm here with the Jewish elders, part of the JVP. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  I've never been more proud to be Jewish. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  I've always thought of Passover as a celebration of liberation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=70.8s)]
*  And liberation can never be just the Jews, because there's nothing free about being by [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=75.36s)]
*  yourself in some sort of country in battle. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  The only way to fight for liberation is to fight for everybody, and in this case, the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=84.11999999999999s)]
*  Palestinians. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  Come for one! Face us all! [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=89.84s)]
*  Come for one! Face us all! [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=92.36s)]
*  Occupation must fall! [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=95.16s)]
*  Give it up for one of Mahmoud Khalil's tireless attorneys, a law professor at CUNY and the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=98.36s)]
*  founder of CLEAR, a vital legal clinic that challenges the U.S. security state, Ramzi Qassem. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  My client, Rumeysa, shared with me and my fellow lawyers representing her that when [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  she was taken by ICE from her campus in Tufts in the video that I'm sure you've all seen, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  and she was whisked across state lines by men in plain clothes in an unmarked van, one [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=129.12s)]
*  of these men turned to her and he said, we are not monsters. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=137.48s)]
*  He said, we're just doing as we're told. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  And so I want to contrast that message with the second message, which is a message of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=153.36s)]
*  gratitude from Mahmoud, from Yunus, from Rumeysa, and I'm sure all the others whose names you [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=166.24s)]
*  know, the message of gratitude for all of you, because you exemplify the grandest Jewish [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=174.88000000000002s)]
*  tradition, the truest password tradition. You have stood in solidarity with the Palestinian [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=182.76s)]
*  people as they have faced genocide. You've stood with Mahmoud, with Rumeysa, with Mahsin [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=190.16s)]
*  as they face abduction and detention. You're standing with Yunus as she continues to fight [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=198.16s)]
*  for her freedom, for her being free, because she is still free. And for that, we are deeply, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=205.16s)]
*  infinitely grateful for all of you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=212.16s)]
*  Please join me in giving a warm welcome to our dear friend who has inspired millions [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=215.16s)]
*  around the world with her conviction and love, the co-founder of Empower Change, Linda Sarsour. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=223.96s)]
*  I'm here to say I pray for you all to have a blessed Passover and just to show my gratitude [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=231.96s)]
*  and any chance that I get to come and say thank you to you directly, I'm going to do [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=239.32s)]
*  that. In Islam, thanking people is thanking God. And I thank God for you every single [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=246.44s)]
*  day for being on the front lines and saying to this administration, to the one before [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=254.16s)]
*  and to the Netanyahu administration, not in our name. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=262.84s)]
*  When Palestine is under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back! When Palestine is [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=269.84s)]
*  under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back! [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=276.84s)]
*  My name is Abbe Stein. I'm a rabbi here in New York City. I want to talk about Miriam, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=279.79999999999995s)]
*  the cup of Miriam, which is just a cup of water. A tradition that has been added relatively [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  recently but is very important to so many of us as a feminist tradition. I will say [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=291.52s)]
*  as a queer person, as a queer tradition, but most importantly right now, I think about [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=297.84s)]
*  water and I think for everyone here, I don't have to tell you what water means to Palestine [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=304.96s)]
*  and to Palestinians and what occupied water, for the lack of a better term, looks like. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=309.84s)]
*  I spent this summer in Palestine for a month and saw how that looks like, how you can tell [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  whether something is a settlement or something is an actual Palestinian home based on whether [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=323.52s)]
*  they have access to national water or if they have to collect their own water. So water [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=328.8s)]
*  really is a symbol of occupation and oppression and for us, it is a symbol of liberation. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=334.64s)]
*  At the same time, water, Miriam, feminism and queer liberation is too often used to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=342.28s)]
*  control people, whether it is the Israeli government and intelligence services threatening [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=349.28s)]
*  gay and lesbian and LGBTQ Palestinians to expose them, so to speak, if they don't cooperate [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=356.28s)]
*  or just using us, trans Jews and LGBTQ Jews as an excuse why they keep killing people, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=364.28s)]
*  why I have so many queer Palestinian friends who before we can talk about liberation just [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=371.28s)]
*  want to live. So right now, as we celebrate Pesach together, as we keep water, as we keep [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  Miriam, as we keep our feminist foremothers, as we keep our queer elders throughout history [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=385.28s)]
*  in mind, this is what Pesach is, liberation for all, whether it is land, water, people [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=392.55999999999995s)]
*  and each and every one of us at home and abroad. Thank you. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXmGvQxZ6-Q&t=399.56s)]
