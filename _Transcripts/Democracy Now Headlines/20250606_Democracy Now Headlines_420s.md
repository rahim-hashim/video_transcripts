President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" now before the Senate could result in over 51,000 preventable deaths each year in the United States. That's according to public health experts at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, who sent a letter warning about the bill's impact to the Senate Finance Committee. An estimated 16 million people stand to lose their health coverage as a result of the changes in the bill, which "imposes onerous paperwork and fails to safeguard healthcare tax credits," says Alison Galvani, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Modeling at Yale and one of the signatories to the letter. She also notes universal healthcare would have the opposite effect and save tens of thousands of lives each year. "There are a lot of ways we can improve how expensive our healthcare is, but taking healthcare away from people is not how to do it," says Galvani.

# Trump Budget Bill Would Lead to 51,000 More Deaths Per Year, as Health Experts Urge Medicare for All

*  billionaires. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  This comes as public health experts warn the proposed cuts could lead to more than 50,000 [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=27.159999999999997s)]
*  preventable deaths each year in the U.S. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  For more, we're joined by one of those experts, Allison Gavani. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=35.16s)]

*  She's part of a group of public health experts at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=46.959999999999994s)]
*  who sent a letter this week to Senate Finance Committee ranking members Ron Wyden and Bernie [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=52.12s)]
*  Sanders warning about the impact of these provisions. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=57.24s)]
*  Welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=61.64s)]
*  It's great to have you with us, Professor. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=63.04s)]
*  If you can start off by talking about exactly what you found. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=65.08s)]
*  We are talking about real lives, not concepts, not policy fights, when it comes to this budget [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=68.8s)]
*  bill that the Senate is now weighing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=75.92s)]
*  Absolutely, yeah. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=78.16s)]
*  Thank you for having me again. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=81.52s)]
*  So the bill proposes deep cuts to Medicaid, imposes onerous paperwork, and fails to safeguard [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=83.04s)]
*  health care tax credits. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=91.64s)]
*  As you mentioned, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that these rollbacks [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=94.2s)]
*  would cause 16 million Americans to lose their insurance. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=100.0s)]
*  Exacerbating the crisis, nursing homes will also become less safe by rescinding staffing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=105.92s)]
*  members. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=112.28s)]
*  Nurses will lose their jobs and patients will suffer. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=115.6s)]
*  Seniors will also be impacted by the elimination of current prescription subsidies. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=120.12s)]
*  So altogether, we projected that these retractions would precipitate more than 51,000 unnecessary [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=127.28s)]
*  deaths annually. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=136.76s)]
*  So if you can talk more about what exactly—we have two different issues. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=141.24s)]
*  One is the budget and what this will mean, for example, around Medicaid and the triggering [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=149.28s)]
*  of Medicare cuts, food assistance. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=155.04s)]
*  Talk particularly where the worst—what you see as the worst cuts will be. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=158.28s)]
*  And then I want to talk about at the same time these massive cuts to grants from the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=164.16s)]
*  NIH, from the National Institutes of Health, that are shutting down everything from cancer [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=169.88s)]
*  research to investigating Alzheimer's and other issues. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=175.72s)]
*  Well, one of the worst cuts to Medicaid is going to be the requirement. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=183.32000000000002s)]
*  It's called the work requirement. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=193.24s)]
*  But the problem is—and we've seen this implemented at state levels with terrible failure. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=197.08s)]
*  To implement an aspect like that on the ground, it requires the government to have many more [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=205.96s)]
*  employees—so that's the taxpayers paying for that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=214.84s)]
*  It's actually an inefficiency. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=218.68s)]
*  Going through the paperwork, people who are working—most people on Medicaid actually [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=221.72s)]
*  are working, but they will need to then prove that they're working, filling out forms, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=228.16s)]
*  and it's been found—like those example in New Hampshire, where they tried to implement [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=235.88s)]
*  something like this, there was an enormous exodus out of their health care because—and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=242.0s)]
*  then when they looked at who was leaving, those people were eligible for health care. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=251.72s)]
*  But they just were having trouble being aware and navigating the labyrinth of bureaucratic [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=259.68s)]
*  paperwork. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=267.12s)]
*  As the whole debate goes on, there's very little mention of Medicare for All. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=268.12s)]
*  You dress this in your letter to Senator Sanders, who is a lead proponent of universal health [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=272.32s)]
*  care. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=277.56s)]
*  Even the Democrats are not raising it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=278.56s)]
*  And yet, this clearly would be a massive solution and cost-saving, life-saving solution. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=286.92s)]
*  As you just said, to put this into context, we previously demonstrated that expanding [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=289.04s)]
*  health care to all Americans would save more than 68,000 lives—save more than 68,000 [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  lives. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=301.2s)]
*  So, in other words, the difference between this bill and the Medicare for All Act amounts [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=302.2s)]
*  to 119,000 lives every year, conservatively. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=309.38s)]
*  I think our parameters are quite conservative, but almost 120,000 people being saved every [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  year. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=320.20000000000005s)]
*  By the way, when we looked at the financial aspects of that, it saves money because a [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=323.20000000000005s)]
*  single-payer universal system makes the implementation of health care vastly more efficient. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=330.32000000000005s)]
*  There are a lot of ways we can improve how expensive our health care is, but taking health [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=341.4s)]
*  care away from people is not how to do it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=345.58s)]
*  So yeah, I think our research underscores the insidious public health ramifications [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=349.23999999999995s)]
*  of the proposed legislation. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=357.84s)]
*  And finally, the massive cuts to research into diseases in this country. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=360.96s)]
*  The U.S. is seen as the gem, the center of research. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=367.68s)]
*  Now well over 1,000 grants have been shut down. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=371.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's very dismaying. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=376.48s)]
*  So science used to be a nonpartisan issue. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=381.48s)]
*  You know, everyone across the political ideology benefits from medical advances and innovations. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=384.56s)]
*  And it's disheartening that public health has become so politically polarized. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  The research funding cuts will hinder advancements in medical innovations, including cancer therapies [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=401.48s)]
*  and treatments for infectious disease, just to name a couple. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjkLyKn_GNM&t=408.92s)]
