# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” October 21, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F534WNArJ-g)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The nightmare in Gaza is intensifying.
*  Those are the words of a top U.N. official as Israel escalates its attacks amidst a devastating
*  siege on northern Gaza.
*  Health officials there say at least 87 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike on Batlahia
*  on Saturday.
*  Officers say the dead include many women and children.
*  We were asleep around 12 a.m. when it suddenly felt like an earthquake hit the area.
*  Debris was falling on us.
*  We rushed outside after hearing screams of women and children and found that our neighbors
*  had been targeted by massive bombs.
*  Tons of explosives had fallen on a residential neighborhood full of civilians and displaced
*  families.
*  Those who are martyred here are children, women and displaced people who fled from other
*  areas due to heavy strikes, seeking shelter in what they believe to be a safer place.
*  Al Jazeera reports another 33 Palestinians have been killed so far today, including 18
*  in the Jubalya refugee camp.
*  Israel is also targeting the last three hospitals in northern Gaza, the Indonesian, Al-Ada and
*  Kamal-Edwan hospitals.
*  Borders reports more than 350 patients are believed to be trapped inside the hospitals.
*  Meanwhile, Israel's blocked six medical NGOs from entering Gaza.
*  The groups include GLIA and the Palestinian-American Medical Association.
*  Israel also killed four water engineers who were traveling to make repairs to the water
*  infrastructure near Chanyunas.
*  According to Oxfam, the engineers were traveling in a clearly marked vehicle when they were
*  attacked.
*  On Sunday, the Palestinian Authority denounced Israel's escalating attacks, saying in a
*  statement, quote,
*  "...genocide is unfolding in northern Gaza in its clearest form, in full view of the
*  world, marked by siege, starvation, forced displacement, destruction of buildings, aerial
*  bombardment, targeting of health centers and mass killings," unquote.
*  Earlier today, the Palestinian journalist Abu Bakr Abed reported Farah al-Dalu has died
*  in a hospital.
*  She was the sister of 19-year-old Shaban al-Dalu, who burned to death last week in an Israeli
*  strike on Al-Aqsa Hospital.
*  Visit DemocracyNow.org to see our interview with Abu Bakr Abed on Friday.
*  Israel has also escalated its assault on Lebanon by attacking nearly a dozen bank branches
*  of Al-Qa'r al-Hasan, a financial institution with ties to Hezbollah.
*  Many of the banks were located in residential buildings and played a critical role in Lebanon's
*  financial sector.
*  On Sunday, the U.N. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, UNIFIL, accused Israel of deliberately
*  demolishing another U.N. observation tower in what UNIFIL described as a flagrant violation
*  of international law.
*  U.S. envoy Amos Hakstein is now in Beirut for talks with Lebanese officials over a possible
*  diplomatic deal to end Israel's attacks.
*  As part of any deal, Axios reports Israel's insisting it maintain the right to fly its
*  warplanes over Lebanon and that Israeli troops be allowed to keep conducting operations in
*  southern Lebanon.
*  Hakstein's visit comes two days after a drone from Lebanon hit Israeli Prime Minister
*  Benjamin Netanyahu's vacation home in northern Israel.
*  Netanyahu was not home at the time of the incident, which caused only superficial damage
*  to his home.
*  In a separate attack, Palestinian fighters in Gaza on Sunday killed the commander of
*  the Israeli military's 401st Brigade, Colonel Asandaksa.
*  He's been described as the highest-ranking Israeli army officer killed in Gaza over the
*  past year.
*  The Biden administration's launch to probe after highly classified U.S. intelligence
*  documents were posted online showing that Israel is taking steps to launch a retaliatory
*  attack against Iran.
*  One document came from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, the other from the National
*  Security Agency.
*  The documents reference recent drills involving air-launched ballistic missiles as well as
*  covert drone activity.
*  On Friday, President Biden was asked if he knew how and when Israel would attack Iran.
*  Biden responded by saying yes and yes.
*  The leaked documents also confirm Israel has nuclear weapons, a fact that has long been
*  known but has never been acknowledged by Israel.
*  Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to deploy the National Guard or military to
*  target domestic critics if he wins.
*  Trump was asked about his threat by Howard Kurtz on Fox News.
*  You talk about the enemy within.
*  There's enemies, America's enemies, outside.
*  The enemy within is a pretty ominous phrase if you're talking about other Americans.
*  I think it's accurate.
*  I mean, I think it's accurate.
*  Questions continue to be raised about Trump's mental state after he held a rally in Pennsylvania,
*  which he called Kamala Harris, uh, expletive vice president.
*  Harris responded by saying Trump's personal attack was, quote, demeaning the office of
*  president.
*  Trump also made crude comments about the size of the late golf legend Arnold Palmer's
*  genitalia.
*  Palmer's family also criticized Trump's remarks.
*  One of Palmer's daughters has said her father, who died in 2016, was appalled and disgusted
*  by Trump's first presidential campaign.
*  Peg Palmer said, quote, What would my dad think of Donald Trump today?
*  I think he'd cringe, she said.
*  In other campaign news, legal experts are questioning billionaire Trump supporter Elon
*  Musk's offer to give a million-dollar daily prize to registered voters in swing states
*  who signed his Super PAC petition.
*  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has described Musk's giveaway as deeply concerning.
*  In Indonesia, Proboa Subianto was sworn in as president on Sunday, eight months after
*  winning the presidential election.
*  He's a former general who's been implicated in mass killings in East Timor, Papua and
*  Aceh, as well as the kidnapping and torture of activists in Jakarta.
*  Proboa is a longtime U.S. protege and the former son-in-law of former Indonesian dictator
*  Suharto.
*  Critics fear his rise to power could result in the return of military rule in Indonesia.
*  In El Salvador, a court has acquitted and freed a group of environmental activists known
*  as the Santa Marta Five.
*  The five activists were instrumental in pressuring El Salvador to issue the world's first-ever
*  ban on metal mining in 2017.
*  They were arrested in January of last year and accused of murder in what was widely denounced
*  as political persecution.
*  This is one of the Santa Marta Five, Saul Rivas, speaking after the ruling Friday.
*  We cannot be criminalizing and detaining people for something that happened in the past.
*  When there was an investigation by the Truth Commission after the peace accords and the
*  facts that could be considered as against humanity were cleared.
*  In Mexico, the Catholic priest, indigenous activist Marcelo Perez, was killed by two
*  gunmen Sunday as he left mass in the southern state of Chiapas.
*  Marcelo Perez was a member of the Tzotzil indigenous group, well known for his human
*  rights activism on behalf of indigenous people and farm workers.
*  This is a community member who'd worked with Marcelo Perez.
*  We have called on the government to clarify this case and bring justice to Father Marcelo,
*  a great priest that always advocated for the poorest and for the people in need, that always
*  listened and helped and now has been murdered.
*  We demand all the government agencies to cooperate and give answers to clarify all this.
*  Tropical storm Oscar has slammed into Cuba after barreling through the Bahamas as a hurricane.
*  Authorities warned of flash flooding, mudslides and heavy winds as millions in Cuba are already
*  grappling with a days-long power outage as its precarious electric grid continues to
*  falter.
*  Massachusetts Congressmember Jim McGovern called on the Biden administration to offer
*  assistance to Cuba, posting on X, quote,
*  "'U.S. policy has directly contributed to Cuba's energy problems by sanctioning ships
*  carrying oil to Cuba and starving the country of foreign exchange earnings.'"
*  In Mozambique, opposition presidential candidate Vinancio Mondlain has called on his supporters
*  to take to the streets in protest after a lawyer and an official with his Podemos party
*  were shot dead in the capital Maputo.
*  The lawyer, Elvino Diaz, was preparing to challenge the results of the October 9 election,
*  although final results have not been announced.
*  Early tallies show Daniel Chapo of the Folimo party in the lead.
*  Preliminary results show Moldova has narrowly voted to join the European Union.
*  Near final results show just over 50 percent of voters supported joining the EU, a lower
*  tally than expected.
*  In a separate vote, Moldova's president failed to win a majority of votes, setting
*  up a runoff on November 3.
*  She's pushed for Moldova, a former Soviet republic, to move further away from Moscow's
*  influence.
*  She and others have accused pro-Russian groups of meddling and vote-buying ahead of Sunday's
*  polls.
*  In Australia, Indigenous Senator Lydia Thorpe was removed by force from a parliament event
*  after she heckled King Charles following a speech to Australian lawmakers.
*  Lydia Thorpe confronted the British royal as she walked towards him, decrying,
*  Other protests against King Charles' visit were held today.
*  Australia's Indigenous people never ceded sovereignty after their land was colonized
*  by Britain and never signed a treaty with the UK.
*  In London, Arizona, charges have been dropped against a deaf black man with cerebral palsy
*  who was beaten and tasered by police officers in August after being falsely accused of stealing
*  a cell phone.
*  Newly released video of Tyron McAlpin's arrest showed officers violently confronting
*  the deaf man who was unable to hear the officer's commands.
*  He was then jailed for 24 days because he could not afford bail.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
