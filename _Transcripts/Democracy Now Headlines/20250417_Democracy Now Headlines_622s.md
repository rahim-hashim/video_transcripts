Sudan is facing the world’s largest humanitarian crisis after two years of war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF. Thousands have died, and some 13 million have been forcibly displaced. There are also widespread reports of sexual and ethnically motivated violence and a worsening hunger crisis. Emtithal Mahmoud, a Darfurian refugee and humanitarian activist, describes how the violence has impacted her own family, including in a recent RSF attack on the Zamzam refugee camp where fighters killed and tortured many civilians. “They kidnapped 58 of the girls in my extended family, and we are still searching for them,” says Mahmoud. “We need the world to pay attention.” Unlike the Darfur crisis of the early 2000s, when it was on the agenda of many world leaders, the current conflict is being largely ignored by the international community, says Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. “It is by far the worst displacement crisis in the world,” notes Egeland.

*  People in Power. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  We welcome you both to Democracy Now! [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  Emithal Mahmoud, describe what's happening in Darfur, describe what's happening in [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=101.2s)]
*  Sudan, as at this point we enter the third year of the civil war between the paramilitary [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=106.04s)]
*  forces and the government. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much for having us. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=115.28s)]
*  It's so harrowing to describe. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=118.84s)]
*  My family have lived in Zanzan camp, which is now completely destroyed for almost 20 [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=121.08s)]
*  years, and the other half of my family is from Al-Fasher, which is now has been under [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=126.0s)]
*  siege for almost over a year. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=130.54s)]
*  And what's so terrifying about what happened is that an IDP camp is an internally displaced [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=132.88s)]
*  person camp. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=136.9s)]
*  This is supposed to be a place of refuge. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=137.9s)]
*  But on Sunday, and in the days before, the RSF brutally attacked the camp, killing more [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=139.88s)]
*  than 400 people by our count on the ground. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=144.72s)]
*  They tortured and killed women and children, and they kidnapped 58 of the girls in my extended [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=147.24s)]
*  family, and we are still searching for them. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  We cannot find them. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  We have not seen them since Sunday. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=156.8s)]
*  This brutality is something that we've seen during the Darfur genocide and we've seen [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=158.28s)]
*  over and over again in this war and in many of the years from the start of the genocide [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=162.16s)]
*  and counting. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=167.9s)]
*  I think that entering the third year of war, we should not be terrified and confused about [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=168.98s)]
*  whether or not the international community is going to act to stop the Al-Fasher massacre [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=174.02s)]
*  from happening. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=178.02s)]
*  We warned that the Zanzan massacre would be happening because the MSF reported a child [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=179.02s)]
*  dies every two hours from the man-made famine due to the siege. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=183.4s)]
*  And now we're warning that the Al-Fasher massacre will happen as we actively, actively [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=187.6s)]
*  try to evacuate people. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=192.46s)]
*  And we're not able to move international aid into Al-Fasher or we were not able to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=195.46s)]
*  move it into Zanzan either because the RSF will not let it pass. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=201.18s)]
*  So currently, we're doing everything that we can through small donors and family members [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  and community to continue moving our people who have now been four times displaced, including [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  my family members. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=213.0s)]
*  Many have been killed and many who are still missing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=214.34s)]
*  And the injured are bleeding out without any care. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=216.68s)]
*  So we're moving as fast as we can, but we need the world to pay attention. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=219.66s)]
*  Emi, we're so sorry for the suffering of your family and your family members who have [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=223.26s)]
*  been killed in this horrific war. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=228.58s)]
*  If you could just kind of give us a quick sense of, you know, how was this two years [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=231.78s)]
*  ago? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=238.3s)]
*  How and why did this war begin between the government forces and the RSF? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=239.66s)]
*  What's at stake? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=244.1s)]
*  Thank you for the question. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  The RSF is the Rapid Support Forces, and it's the latest iteration of the Janjaweed who [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=248.66s)]
*  terrorized Darfur for decades. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=253.06s)]
*  And the SAF is the Sudanese Armed Forces. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=256.26s)]
*  Now, the Sudanese Armed Forces created the Janjaweed and institutionalized the RSF under [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=258.74s)]
*  Bashir, the former dictator. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=264.74s)]
*  So in 2018 and 2019, there was a lot of movement by the youth, including a lot of us from Darfur [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=267.62s)]
*  who walked for a thousand kilometers, mobilizing thousands across the way and reaching Khartoum [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=274.34s)]
*  to inspire collective responsibility for peace. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=280.58s)]
*  Just a couple of months after our peace walk in 2018, I was in Sudan to do it all over [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=283.53999999999996s)]
*  again in December, and that's when the revolution started. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  Now, the revolution was a peaceful revolution led by young people, led by women, and people [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=292.46s)]
*  called for an end to more than 30 years of dictatorship and horrible, horrible genocides, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=297.5s)]
*  plural, including what happened in South Sudan in 21 years of a war. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=304.1s)]
*  So in 2019, the world was very inspired, and people said, blue for Sudan, and the people [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=307.7s)]
*  in Khartoum said, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=313.18s)]
*  which means you racist, you hypocrite, the entire country is Darfur. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=316.38s)]
*  So they heard our cry, and that was to the dictator. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=319.90000000000003s)]
*  In 2019, the dictator fell, and there was a moment of hope, but, you know, there were [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=323.58s)]
*  these massacres of young people. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=329.62s)]
*  They were sitting with sit-ins and peacefully just trying, trying to push for democracy, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=332.18s)]
*  which is something that we've all hoped for and prayed for, and that is something [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=338.34s)]
*  that's part of our culture. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=341.38s)]
*  We're very democratic as indigenous people in Sudan and in Sudan in general. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=343.42s)]
*  And then in 2019, hundreds were killed and thrown into the Nile, hundreds of children [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=348.02s)]
*  and young people in Khartoum who—I say children, but they were young people who were pushing. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=352.82000000000005s)]
*  And I do say children, because my cousin, Mohammed, he was 15 years old when he was [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=356.94s)]
*  killed in January in 2019 at the beginning of the revolution. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=360.1s)]
*  So many people were killed and thrown in the Nile. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=364.18s)]
*  Many are still missing. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=366.22s)]
*  So then in 2021, the RSF and the SAF cooperated to overthrow the civilian transition. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=367.22s)]
*  So a civilian transitionary government was put in place with a deal that would be, you [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=373.86s)]
*  know, it would spend three years, and in the first couple of years, the military would [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=378.78000000000003s)]
*  be in power, which us young people said, do not make this deal, do not cooperate with [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  SAF and RSF, who are both liable for genocide in Darfur and other regions. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=387.06s)]
*  But they did cooperate. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=392.70000000000005s)]
*  And then in 2021, RSF and SAF cooperated for a coup that overthrew the civilian government [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=393.82000000000005s)]
*  and any hope for a peaceful transition. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=399.70000000000005s)]
*  And then now in 2023, two years ago, right as we were getting ready for Eid Ramadan, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=401.82000000000005s)]
*  the massacre began. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=408.44000000000005s)]
*  This war is not a civil war, according to people on the ground. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=410.66s)]
*  It is a war against the people, because we do not consent to this war. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=414.26s)]
*  So to make it very simple, you have two warring parties who used to cooperate to commit genocide [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=417.78s)]
*  and to, you know, massacre our people. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=424.58s)]
*  And now they fell out and are having this power struggle. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=427.32s)]
*  And they're trying desperately to cling onto power. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=430.98s)]
*  And they're being funded by many nations, rich nations on both sides. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=434.65999999999997s)]
*  And I say this as somebody who thinks that there should be zero tolerance for genocide. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=439.7s)]
*  I understand that right now the RSF is the biggest danger for us in Darfur and all over [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=444.06s)]
*  the country. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=448.78000000000003s)]
*  They've used sexual violence as a weapon of war. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=449.78000000000003s)]
*  And the UNICEF reports that 12 million people are at risk of gender-based violence, and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=452.3s)]
*  they're often repeatedly subjected to the same thing. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=457.38s)]
*  And they've created man-made famine. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=460.26s)]

*  They've done so many different things that are acts that constitute war crimes. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=463.54s)]
*  The SAF has done the same. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=468.86s)]
*  But the reality is the RSF and the SAF, they both need to be held accountable to stop this [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=470.58s)]

*  Well, we'd like to bring in Jan Eglund, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=477.78000000000003s)]

*  If you could talk about the worsening humanitarian crisis in the midst of this horrific war and [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=487.14s)]

*  Fifteen million people now displaced by violence. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=510.1s)]
*  I've been there twice now during this last two years of war. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=514.34s)]
*  You see devastation everywhere, really. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=520.58s)]
*  But we are many groups on the ground. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=525.3000000000001s)]

*  We try to provide as much relief as we can. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=539.5400000000001s)]
*  But indeed, aid is scarce. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=543.26s)]
*  It's beyond me that when I was in the UN in 2003, I mean, 22 years ago, during the first [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djKDFM3z_3c&t=547.22s)]
