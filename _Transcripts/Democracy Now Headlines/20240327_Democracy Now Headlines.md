*  AMY GOODMAN, The War and Peace Report.
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The U.S. Supreme Court appears set to preserve access to the abortion pill Mifipristone,
*  which is used for roughly two-thirds of all abortions in the United States.
*  Oral arguments were held Tuesday in a case brought by a group of anti-choice medical
*  associations, which have sought to overturn moves by the FDA to increase accessibility
*  to the drug, which was first approved over 20 years ago.
*  On Tuesday, several justices questioned if the doctors even had standing to bring the
*  challenge.
*  Abortion rights activists rallied outside the Supreme Court ahead of the ruling.
*  This decision should not be held by a couple of justices.
*  It's a decision between a doctor and a family, and that's how it's always been.
*  And let's be clear, it's safe and accessible and has been for over 20 years, with hundreds
*  of thousands of people in the United States, and it's a decision that's been made by
*  the Supreme Court.
*  It's a decision that's been made by the Supreme Court.
*  It's a decision that's been made by the Supreme Court.
*  It's a decision that's been made by the Supreme Court.
*  It's a decision that's been made by the Supreme Court.
*  It's a decision that's been made by the Supreme Court.
*  We'll have more on the Supreme Court hearing after headlines.
*  The official death toll in Gaza is nearing 32,500 as Israel continues its assault and
*  defiance of a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a Ramadan ceasefire.
*  One Monday, an Israeli airstrike killed Sahar Akram Ryan, a longtime correspondent for the
*  Palestinian news agency Wafa.
*  His son was also killed in the attack.
*  By one count, 136 journalists have been killed so far in Gaza.
*  On the humanitarian front, UNICEF's James Older says the hunger crisis in Gaza is worsening
*  as Palestinian families struggle to find food to eat.
*  A week ago, I was in Kamal Adwan Hospital where we've had those reports of 20 plus children
*  dying of malnutrition and dehydration.
*  When I was there, I saw a room full of mothers and carers, not always mothers, some mothers
*  have been killed.
*  Carers shuddering over children who are paper thin, absolutely paper thin.
*  Incubators full of babies who are born prematurely because of the stress on mothers, also malnourished.
*  On Tuesday, UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese accused Israel of committing acts
*  of genocide.
*  She spoke in Geneva about her major new report.
*  Following nearly six months of unrelenting Israeli assault on occupied Gaza, it is my
*  solemn duty to report on the worst of what humanity is capable of and to present my finding,
*  the anatomy of a genocide.
*  History teaches us that genocide is a process, not a single act.
*  It starts with the dehumanization of a group as other and the denial of that group's humanity
*  and ends with the destruction of the group in all or in part.
*  The dehumanization of Palestinians as a group is the hallmark of their history of ethnic
*  cleansing, dispossession and apartheid.
*  In Washington, D.C., U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with the Israeli Defense
*  Minister Yoav Galant on Tuesday.
*  Austin said the civilian death toll in Gaza has been, quote, far too high, but he vowed
*  the U.S. would keep arming Israel.
*  A new report by the arms control group SIPRI found 69 percent of all arms imported by Israel,
*  that's over two-thirds, come from the United States.
*  The group said U.S. weapons, particularly warplanes, have played a major role in Israel's
*  attacks on Gaza and Lebanon.
*  Meanwhile, the State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said the Biden administration
*  has not found Israel's actions in Gaza to be in violation of U.S. or international law.
*  We have not found them to be in violation of international humanitarian law, either
*  when it comes to the conduct of the war or when it comes to the provision of humanitarian
*  assistance.
*  President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke in Raleigh, North Carolina, Tuesday.
*  A group of pro-Palestinian activists interrupted the president while he talked about his record
*  on health care.
*  A patient with a heart disease, diabetes or a child with asthma couldn't get coverage.
*  Why?
*  Because the insurance company considered those a pre-existing condition, allowed them to
*  deny coverage.
*  Everybody deserves health care.
*  They have a point.
*  We need to get a lot more care into Gaza.
*  In Lebanon, seven paramedics have died in an Israeli airstrike on an emergency health
*  center in the town of Habreya.
*  Lebanon's health ministry condemned the attack as a violation of the Geneva Convention.
*  Hezbollah responded by firing dozens of rockets into northern Israel.
*  One factory worker reportedly died in Israel.
*  Authorities in Maryland fear six missing construction workers died on Tuesday when the Francis Scott
*  Key Bridge partially collapsed after a massive cargo ship crashed into a support column.
*  The crew on the 95,000-ton cargo ship sent an urgent May Day call after the ship lost
*  power possibly due to contaminated fuel.
*  The warning gave authorities on land the chance to limit bridge traffic, but eight construction
*  workers were still on the bridge where they'd been fixing potholes.
*  Only two of the workers were rescued on Tuesday.
*  The missing workers include a Salvadoran father of three, named Miguel Luna, a Honduran father
*  of two, named Menor Yasser Suazo Sandova, two Guatemalan men and at least one Mexican
*  national.
*  We'll have more on this story later in the show.
*  According Russia has extended Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich's pretrial
*  detention until at least June 30th.
*  Friday will mark one year since Evan was detained on espionage charges while he was on a reporting
*  trip.
*  The police in India detained dozens of protesters Tuesday as they attempted to march to Prime
*  Minister Narendra Modi's residence in New Delhi.
*  The protest came in response to last week's arrest of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kedrawal,
*  who's a prominent critic of Modi.
*  This all comes as part of a political crackdown ahead of national elections in India, which
*  begin in April.
*  The New York judge presiding over Donald Trump's hush money trial has imposed a partial gag
*  order on the former president, barring him from attacking witnesses, jurors, court staff
*  and others.
*  In his order, Judge Juan Marchand noted Trump's history of making quote, threatening, inflammatory
*  and denigrating comments.
*  The criminal trial begins April 15th.
*  NBC News has reversed its decision to hire Ronna McDaniel, the former chair of the Republican
*  National Committee.
*  Her hiring sparked a rare on-air revolt by many of the top anchors on NBC and MSNBC over
*  her role in spreading Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election.
*  In campaign news, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has tapped
*  the massively wealthy Silicon Valley attorney Nicole Shanahan to be his running mate.
*  Shanahan's the former wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin.
*  She gave over $4 million to fund a controversial Super Bowl ad for Kennedy, which resembled
*  a 1960 commercial by his uncle John F. Kennedy.
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s run for the White House has been widely condemned by other members
*  of the Kennedy family, in part due to his longtime advocacy against vaccines.
*  Dozens of members of the extended Kennedy family met with Joe Biden at the White House
*  their support for his re-election.
*  And more details are coming to light about the federal probe into the music mogul Sean
*  Diddy Combs.
*  On Monday, federal agents raided his homes in Los Angeles and Miami, the investigations
*  being led by a team at the Department of Homeland Security, which focuses on human trafficking.
*  In recent months, Combs has faced five separate lawsuits over sexual misconduct, including
*  one lawsuit by a woman who accused Combs of raping her and forcing her into sex trafficking.
*  Combs' lawyers have issued a statement proclaiming his innocence while criticizing federal agents
*  for using what they called military-level force during the House raids.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
