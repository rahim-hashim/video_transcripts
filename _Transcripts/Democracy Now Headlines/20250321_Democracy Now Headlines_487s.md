We speak with the Brennan Center’s Faiza Patel, who warns the Trump administration is ramping up efforts to target international students and other visitors and immigrants to the United States over pro-Palestinian speech. The State Department has reportedly launched a new effort using artificial intelligence to help identify and revoke visas for people the government deems to be supporting U.S.-designated terrorist groups, based primarily on the individuals’ social media accounts. “Foreign students are running scared,” says Patel. She also notes that while “AI-driven sounds really fancy,” the process is more likely to be a basic keyword search prone to “rudimentary mistakes.”

# “Catch and Revoke”: AI-Driven State Dept. Program Targets Pro-Palestinian Students & Visa Holders
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=3.44s)]
*  After Mahmoud Khalil was detained two weeks ago, President Trump warned he was the, quote, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  first arrest of many to come. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=10.72s)]
*  Trump's warning comes as the State Department's launched a program to use artificial intelligence [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=14.34s)]
*  to scrape the social media accounts of foreign nationals, including students, to identify [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=18.46s)]
*  possible targets for deportation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=24.76s)]
*  We're joined right now by Faisa Patel, senior director of the Brennan Center for Justice's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=27.76s)]
*  Liberty and National Security Program. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=33.36s)]
*  Her new piece for the Brennan Center is headlined, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=35.24s)]
*  U.S. AI-Driven Catch and Revoke Initiatives Threatens First Amendment Rights. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=38.0s)]
*  Thanks so much for being with us, Faisa. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=44.6s)]
*  Explain what is going on. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=46.8s)]
*  So one thing that's going on is something that's been going on for a really long time, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=50.08s)]
*  which is that government agencies have been collecting social media information. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=55.12s)]
*  They've been scraping social media. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=60.16s)]
*  They've been keeping tabs on what Americans are saying. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=62.4s)]
*  And this is something that started during, really, the end of the Obama administration, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=65.56s)]
*  continued through the first Trump administration, and continued through the Biden administration. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=70.6s)]
*  And I think it's important to also understand two things. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=76.56s)]
*  One is AI-driven. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=80.5s)]
*  Sounds really fancy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=81.88s)]
*  I mean, basically, what they're going to be doing is keyword searches. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=82.92s)]
*  And we've seen this play out with their attempts to identify so-called DEI initiatives, which [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=86.6s)]
*  led to things like removing information about being all gay. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  So I think you have a sense of— [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=97.84s)]
*  The claim that dropped the bomb in Japan, and they took out the word gay? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=99.8s)]
*  Well, they just took out the whole reference, right? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=103.32s)]
*  I mean, you see this playing out. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=105.52s)]
*  I mean, they make a lot of really rudimentary mistakes, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=107.0s)]
*  Because there's no context, there's no understanding. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=112.4s)]
*  You're doing keyword searches, and you're taking things offline, in the case of the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=114.84s)]
*  DEI stuff. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=119.48s)]
*  But when you translate that over to the social media scraping context, you can understand [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=120.48s)]
*  how that will work out, right? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=126.72s)]
*  Because they will be looking for certain terms, and they will be targeting people based on [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=128.6s)]
*  the speech. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=134.28s)]
*  And that can sweep very, very broadly. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=136.0s)]
*  In the current context, where they're going after pro-Palestinian protests, you've got [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=138.12s)]
*  to ask, right, is the fact that I liked a free Palestine post going to be enough to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  have me deported? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=147.84s)]
*  I mean, foreign students are running scared because they may have done something very [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=148.84s)]
*  innocuous in social media, and now they're in the crosshairs. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=154.0s)]
*  But I also think it's important to remember that the focus on pro-Palestinian speech is [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=157.88000000000002s)]
*  sort of the tip of the iceberg. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  If you look at the executive order that Trump put out, which sort of previews this program, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=168.24s)]
*  it's not just about what he characterizes as pro-terrorist, pro-Hamas speech. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=173.4s)]
*  It's also about anything that the administration considers as being basically un-American, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=178.72s)]
*  right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=183.68s)]
*  And so that covers a vast swath of speech. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=185.06s)]
*  It covers all kinds of protest activity, from environmental, pro-migrant, I don't [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=188.72s)]
*  know, pro-democracy, pro-voter. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=195.32s)]
*  You know, it's a wide space that can be covered here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=197.36s)]
*  Are you concerned about this latest news we had in headlines? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=201.32s)]
*  supporting Trump's agenda, including his task force to combat anti-Semitism. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=218.72s)]
*  This is a law firm. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=223.92s)]
*  And yet we just had a Jewish UCLA student, Israeli-American Jewish UCLA student, saying [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=225.36s)]
*  it's anti-Semitic to go after Jewish students who are protesting against Israel's war on [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=232.32s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=237.6s)]
*  I mean, I think there's a lot of concern overall that civil society institutions have [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=238.6s)]
*  been crumbling, almost, in the face of pressure from the Trump administration. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=245.44s)]
*  And I think that sweeps across the board to media organizations that have settled lawsuits [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  with him, universities. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=256.56s)]
*  I mean, there was a report in the Wall Street Journal that Colombia was going to accede [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=258.28s)]
*  to the demands from the Trump administration, and there has been a lot of pressure on the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=263.56s)]
*  law firms as well. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=267.76s)]
*  So this is, you know, you can't look at any one of these things in isolation. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=268.88s)]
*  I think it's an overall attack on civil society institutions that could potentially [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=273.64s)]
*  block his agenda. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=279.76s)]
*  So, it's a catch-and-revoke program. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=280.76s)]
*  Explain that further and how that fits into the First Amendment and privacy rights. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=284.24s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=288.44s)]
*  So, I mean, this is a play, right, on catch-and-release, which was basically the term that was used [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=289.44s)]
*  to describe the policy of sort of apprehending people at the border who were asylum seekers [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=297.2s)]
*  and then releasing them into the country because our immigration court system just really doesn't [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=304.08s)]
*  have the capacity to address their claims in a timely fashion, and we don't actually [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  have detention capacity either. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=315.64s)]
*  So that's—it's a play on that term. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=317.44s)]
*  And what that means is, I mean, the catch part is basically we're going to figure out [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=320.32s)]
*  who is involved, and currently we're looking at pro-Palestinian protests, who is involved [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=324.84s)]
*  in these protests, and they have a few different sources for that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=329.88s)]
*  There are some organizations that have been doxing people who took part in protests, and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=333.4s)]
*  they claim to have provided that information to the State Department and to DHS, so that's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=338.76s)]
*  one source. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=345.08s)]
*  The other source is going through social media. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=346.08s)]
*  Now, they have an advantage when it comes to foreigners when going through social media [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=348.32s)]
*  because since the last—oh, gosh, I'm going to space in the time, but I think like seven [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=352.59999999999997s)]
*  years or so, the State Department has been collecting social media handles from everybody [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=358.68s)]
*  who applies for a visa. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=364.44s)]
*  That's 14.7 million people a year, roughly, and they actually now want to expand that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=366.35999999999996s)]
*  program to another 33 million a year, which includes people who are in the United States [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=371.47999999999996s)]
*  who may be applying for, you know, immigration benefits. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm here on a student visa, I get a job, I want to apply for a work visa, so they're [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=380.08s)]
*  trying to extend that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=385.76s)]
*  So this is all like this whole complex. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=387.68s)]
*  So once they know your social media handle, right, they can track what you say online [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=390.12s)]
*  very, very easily. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=394.28s)]
*  Now, you can create new handles, but, you know, that gives them a baseline to start [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=395.52s)]
*  from, and that means that, you know, everybody's speech can be monitored, and it's not actually [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=400.32s)]
*  just the person whose handle you have, right? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=406.02s)]
*  It's not just Khalil, for example, in this case, if they were monitoring him. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=409.8s)]
*  They would also be then, you know, figuring out who his networks are, who the people are [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=414.36s)]
*  in the United States, who are his friends, who are his work colleagues, who are his teachers. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=418.72s)]
*  It's a very pervasive effort. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=423.32s)]
*  And finally, Trump's proposal for a new travel ban that would target citizens of dozens [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=425.08000000000004s)]
*  of countries. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=429.82s)]
*  Draft list of recommendations suggest a red list of 11 countries, including Afghanistan, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=431.16s)]
*  Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=436.88s)]
*  I mean, this is a redo of what he did in his first term. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=440.96s)]
*  And I think one of the things that's super scary about it is that he's also directed [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=444.88s)]
*  the secretary of state to go back and look at people who got visas in the previous four [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=449.0s)]
*  years under the Biden administration and see if they can be deported, too. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=454.24s)]
*  Well, I want to thank you for being with us. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=457.76s)]
*  And Faiza Patel is senior director of the Brennan Center for Justice's Liberty and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=460.68s)]
*  National Security program. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=466.64s)]
*  Her new piece for the Brennan Center will link to USAID-driven Catch and Revoke Initiative [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=468.44s)]
*  Threatens First Amendment Rights. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeiXfy1Dwso&t=473.52s)]
