We speak with foreign policy analyst Matt Duss about increasingly fraught relations between the United States and Ukraine, which have undergone a seismic shift under the second Trump administration. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting with President Trump at the White House on Friday and is expected to sign an agreement giving the U.S. access to his country's rare earth minerals, which are key components in mobile phones and other advanced technology. It's unclear what, if anything, Ukraine will get in return, even as Trump pushes Kyiv to reach a deal with Moscow to end the war that began in February 2022 when Russian forces invaded Ukraine. Trump is simultaneously moving to restore relations with Russia and lift its international isolation. Duss says the throughline in Trump's thinking, from Ukraine to Gaza and elsewhere, is that "great powers" like the United States "make the decisions, and less powerful countries, less powerful communities and peoples simply have to live with the consequences."

*  President Trump's meeting at the White House today with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=6.28s)]
*  to sign a deal to give the United States access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=11.88s)]
*  But details of the deal remain unclear, including what Ukraine gets in exchange. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=17.84s)]
*  Today's meeting comes just over a week after Trump accused Zelensky of being a dictator. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=23.48s)]
*  On Thursday, Trump appeared to back off the charge when questioned by a reporter. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=29.4s)]
*  Mr. President, do you still think that Mr. Zelensky is a dictator? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=33.76s)]
*  Did I say that? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=41.36s)]
*  I can't believe I said that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=42.36s)]
*  Next question. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=44.36s)]
*  President Trump made the comment while meeting at the White House with the British Prime [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=46.2s)]
*  Minister Keir Starmer. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  On Thursday, Trump also talked about the mineral deal with Ukraine. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=51.32s)]
*  We'll be signing a historic agreement that will make the United States a major partner [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=56.52s)]
*  in developing Ukraine's minerals and rare earths and oil and gases. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=61.28s)]
*  And we have a great understanding. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  I think it's going to be great for Ukraine. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=70.92s)]
*  We're going to be at the site and we'll be digging. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=72.56s)]
*  We'll be dig, dig, digging. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=77.8s)]
*  Dig we must. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=79.6s)]
*  The American taxpayers will now effectively be reimbursed for the money and hundreds [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=80.6s)]
*  of billions of dollars poured into helping Ukraine defend itself, which by and of itself [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  is a very worthy thing to do. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  Additionally, the minerals agreement will provide the basis for a more sustainable future [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=94.32s)]
*  relationship between the United States and Ukraine and thus stimulate the long-term prosperity [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  that will help the Ukrainians rebuild their country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=106.04s)]
*  It's been demolished. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=110.36000000000001s)]
*  This all comes as a rift is growing between the United States and Europe as the Trump [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  administration moves closer to Russia. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  On Thursday, U.S. and Russian diplomats met in Turkey for another round of talks as momentum [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=120.12s)]
*  grows to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  But many questions remain about what a peace deal could look like. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=127.56s)]
*  We're joined in Washington, D.C. by Matt Duss, executive vice president, Center for [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=130.96s)]
*  International Policy, former foreign policy adviser, Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=135.26s)]
*  His recent piece for The Guardian has headlined What Are We to Make of Trump's Ukraine Policy? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=139.96s)]
*  Matt, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=145.14s)]
*  Talk about what you understand at this point. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=148.02s)]
*  At the time of this broadcast, the meeting between Zelensky and Trump has not taken place [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=150.42s)]
*  at the White House yet. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=156.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=157.66s)]
*  Well, what we understand, what I understand right now is that a few weeks ago this deal [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=158.66s)]
*  on rare earth minerals actually originated with the Ukrainians in the hopes that this [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=163.88000000000002s)]
*  would be a way to entice Donald Trump into offering U.S. security guarantees. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=168.96s)]
*  They understand, I think quite rightly, that Donald Trump is always interested in how he [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  can profit, how he can cut deals, and the hope was that in exchange for some claim to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine's rare earth mineral wealth, this would translate into real military security [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=185.72000000000003s)]
*  guarantees from the United States to Ukraine's security. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=192.04s)]
*  Donald Trump responded to that by saying, I love this idea. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=195.44s)]
*  I'm not going to give you any real security guarantees. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=198.44s)]
*  However, he does seem to imply that by giving the United States a stake in future profits [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=201.28s)]
*  in Ukraine, this in itself could translate into a form of security guarantee. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  He has talked about U.S. workers being present doing this work in Ukraine as a form of a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=213.28s)]
*  that would also mean that Donald Trump, the United States, would respond militarily to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=219.92s)]
*  an attack by Russia that endangered those Americans. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  So this is still unclear, as are the actual details of this minerals deal. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=228.76s)]
*  So, I mean, it's very interesting, because you think the person who's most concerned [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=234.04s)]
*  about thisâ€”I mean, Zelensky, for reasons of just how much of the rare earth minerals [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=238.88s)]
*  they would be promising to the U.S. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=245.56s)]
*  But the person who would be most concerned about this is the president of Russia, is [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  Putin. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=252.24s)]
*  I mean, I think that's right. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=253.24s)]
*  You know, he obviously does not want the United States and Ukraine to be drawing into a closer [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  relationship. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=261.08s)]
*  So, again, this is why I say we really do need to wait and see the actual details of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=262.08s)]
*  this deal. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=266.48s)]
*  As of right now, it has Ukraine promising to invest some portion of their mineral wealth [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=267.48s)]
*  into a shared fund between Ukraine and the United States, which would also be reinvested [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=273.08s)]
*  in Ukraine, although U.S. companies would be the ones developing this. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=279.56s)]
*  Donald Trump sees this as a way of getting the United States, quote, paid back for its [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=283.64s)]
*  support for Ukraine's defense. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=289.36s)]
*  Anything that draws the U.S. and Ukraine closer is something that can't make Vladimir Putin [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=290.36s)]
*  very happy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=295.36s)]
*  Cabinet meeting this week, President Trump was asked by reporters about tariffs on the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=300.1s)]
*  European Union. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=306.62s)]
*  And I'm asking you this as Trump just met, of course, with the British Prime Minister [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=307.62s)]
*  Stammer. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=313.74s)]
*  They also talked about Ukraine. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=314.74s)]
*  But this is particularly interesting, what he said, what Trump said about the European [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=316.58000000000004s)]
*  Union. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=323.58000000000004s)]
*  I mean, let's be honest. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=325.06s)]
*  The European Union was formed in order to screw the United States. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=326.53999999999996s)]
*  That's the purpose of it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=329.82s)]
*  And they've done a good job of it, but now I'm president. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=331.74s)]
*  Can you talk about the history and what Trump is talking about? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=334.65999999999997s)]
*  From his perspective, he clearly sees the EU as a way to just form a larger economic [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=339.94s)]
*  block that could compete with and possibleâ€”as he said, it screwed the United States. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=345.38s)]
*  Obviously, it's much more complicated than that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=351.18s)]
*  Economic competition is part of it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=353.82s)]
*  I mean, coming out of World War II, there was a huge security and political component [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=355.82s)]
*  of this, Europe trying to draw together to coordinate and to talk more effectively to [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=360.94s)]
*  avoid a third round. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=366.65999999999997s)]
*  We went through two world wars, you know, driven by European economic and military competition. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=368.68s)]
*  So it was a real effort to avoid that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=375.3s)]
*  But Donald Trump simply sees it as a way, as he said, to screw the United States by, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=377.68s)]
*  you know, separate European countries drawing together into one large economic formation [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=383.04s)]
*  that could make joint economic decisions. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=387.88s)]
*  And so, now President Trump is threatening tariffs starting Tuesday on Mexico, on Canada, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=391.68s)]
*  increased tariffs on China and threatening to tariff the whole European Union. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=399.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=405.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, he did this in his first term. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=407.47999999999996s)]
*  He, you know, he sees tariffs as, you know, yet another way to extract concessions. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=408.88s)]
*  It's hard to know exactly how far he's going to go, as we saw in his comments just [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  now about Zelensky. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=418.4s)]
*  Last week he was calling Zelensky a dictator. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=419.71999999999997s)]
*  This week, he can't believe he said that. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=422.2s)]
*  You know, frankly, I can't believe he said that either. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=424.12s)]
*  So we'll have to wait and see what he actually does. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  I think what's interesting about all these meetings we've been seeing from European [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=429.14s)]
*  leaders Macron last week and Starmor just yesterdayâ€”and I'm sure we'll see this [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=432.88s)]
*  from Zelensky todayâ€”is that they all understand that they do not want to be in public spats [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=437.68s)]
*  with Donald Trump. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=442.84s)]
*  They are seeking ways to flatter him. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=443.84s)]
*  They're seeking ways to demonstrate that he can profit from a better relationship with [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=445.12s)]
*  their countries. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=450.88s)]
*  In your recent piece for The Guardian, where you talk about what are we to make of Trump's [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=453.12s)]
*  You talk about discussions between the U.S. and Moscow and deciding the future of Ukraine. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=459.52s)]
*  You also compare this to U.S.-Israel relations, as both nations plan the ethnic cleansing [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  of Palestinians from Gaza. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=472.96s)]
*  So if you can talk about, in both cases, the first leaving out Ukraine, though he's meeting [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=476.52s)]
*  with Zelensky today and denying he saidâ€”of course, he did say that Zelensky is a dictatorâ€”but [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=481.96s)]
*  leaving out Ukraine and leaving out the Palestinians when it comes to their fate. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=488.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=493.44s)]
*  I mean, I see a great deal of similarity, a consistency, to Trump's approach. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=494.44s)]
*  He sees the global order as one in which great powers, powerful countries make the decisions, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=499.24s)]
*  and less powerful countries, less powerful communities and peoples simply have to live [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=505.72s)]
*  with the consequences. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=510.64000000000004s)]
*  We saw that in hisâ€”you know, the negotiation between the United States and Russia, hosted [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  by Saudi Arabia, where Russia and the United States were essentially determining the future [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=516.18s)]
*  of Ukraine. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=521.3s)]
*  We saw this in the appearance at the White House with Benjamin Netanyahu a few weeks [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=522.3s)]
*  ago, where he announced his proposal for the removal, essentially the ethnic cleansing [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=526.46s)]
*  of Gaza, a decision with huge consequences for the Palestinian people and for the region, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=531.54s)]
*  made without a Palestinian in sight. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=537.9s)]
*  So again, I think this is how Trump sees the world, the United States, by dint of its enormous [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=540.42s)]
*  economic and military power, sits with other great powers and simply determines the rules [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=546.06s)]
*  of the road, and weaker countries and other peoples who aren't in the room have to deal [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=550.9s)]
*  with it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=555.0999999999999s)]
*  Finally, you saw this video, AI-generated video, that President Trump retweeted on his [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=556.0999999999999s)]
*  social media, on Truth Social, this horrific video about Gaza. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=564.78s)]
*  And it has Trump, Gaza, a huge hotel. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=571.3399999999999s)]
*  It has a gold statue of President Trump. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=575.38s)]
*  It has Elon Musk walking down the streets. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=577.82s)]
*  And it has the Netanyahu and Trump sitting on beach chairs on the ocean with their cocktails. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=580.92s)]
*  And finally, it has Trump dancing with a almost completely naked, her bottom naked woman. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=591.7s)]
*  What is this? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=601.34s)]
*  I don't have a good answer for you. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=604.34s)]
*  I don't know who dropped acid and made that video. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=606.7800000000001s)]
*  But, you know, it reallyâ€” [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=609.9s)]
*  The point isn't who made it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=610.9s)]
*  The point is he tweeted it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=611.9s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=614.9s)]
*  No, that's right. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=615.9s)]
*  You know, it isâ€”it's, you know, clearly that appealed to him. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=616.9s)]
*  But I mean, we saw this from his comments with Netanyahu, is that he sees, you know, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=620.46s)]
*  the redevelopment, as he would say it, of Gaza as a source of potential profit, just [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=625.5400000000001s)]
*  as he sees this deal on rare earth minerals with Ukraine as a source of potential profit. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=629.98s)]
*  In both of these cases, you always have to follow the money. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=635.3000000000001s)]
*  You know, the thing to ask about every decision Donald Trump makes is how does this translate [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=638.62s)]
*  into money in Donald Trump's pocket? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=643.98s)]
*  So he clearly sees some advantage into this, you know, this garish redevelopment of Gaza [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=646.94s)]
*  into, you know, one big Trump casino and golf course, of course, without any consideration [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=653.02s)]
*  for the people who actually live there right now. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUQOChAO7w&t=658.18s)]
