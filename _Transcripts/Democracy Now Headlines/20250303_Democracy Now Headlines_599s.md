A public clash at the White House between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance has left the future of U.S. foreign policy uncertain. Zelensky had traveled to the White House last week to sign a deal giving the United States partial control over Ukraine's raw earth minerals in exchange for continued military aid for its war against Russia. But the deal imploded over the course of a dramatic televised press conference, with Trump and Vance deriding Zelensky and suggesting that Ukraine should concede to Russia. We play an extended excerpt of the heated exchange.

*  If you didn't have our military equipment, if you didn't have our military equipment, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=396.86s)]
*  this war would have been over in two weeks. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=402.3s)]
*  In three days. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=404.7s)]
*  I heard it from Putin. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=405.7s)]
*  In three days. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=406.82s)]
*  This is something new. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=407.82s)]
*  Maybe less. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=408.82s)]
*  In two weeks. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=409.82s)]
*  Of course, yes. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=410.82s)]
*  It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=411.82s)]
*  I tell you. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=413.42s)]
*  Just say thank you. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=414.42s)]
*  I said a lot of times thank you to American people. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=415.5s)]
*  Except that there are disagreements and let's go litigate those disagreements rather than [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=419.18s)]
*  trying to fight it out in the American media when you're wrong. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=423.26s)]
*  We know that you're wrong. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=426.9s)]
*  But you see, I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on out here. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=427.9s)]
*  I think it's very important. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=431.58s)]
*  That's why I kept this going so long. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=432.58s)]
*  You have to be thankful. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=435.53999999999996s)]
*  You don't have the cards. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=437.06s)]
*  You're buried there. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=438.78s)]
*  You're people are dying. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=439.78s)]
*  You're running low on soldiers. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=441.9s)]
*  Listen, you're running low on soldiers. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=443.46s)]
*  It would be a damn good thing. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=446.46s)]
*  Then you tell us, I don't want to cease fire. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=448.46s)]
*  I don't want to cease fire. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=450.7s)]
*  I want to go and I wanted this. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=452.02000000000004s)]
*  Look, if you could get a ceasefire right now, I'd tell you you take it so the bullets stop [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=454.38s)]
*  flying and your men stop getting killed. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=459.22s)]
*  Of course we want to stop the war. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=461.18s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=462.62s)]
*  You don't want to cease fire. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=463.62s)]
*  But I said to you, with guarantees. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=464.62s)]
*  I want a ceasefire because you'll get a ceasefire faster than an agreement. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=465.62s)]
*  Ask our people about ceasefire. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=468.70000000000005s)]
*  What they think. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=470.5s)]
*  It doesn't matter for you what this means. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=471.5s)]
*  That wasn't with me. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=473.22s)]
*  That was with a guy named Biden who was not a smart person. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=474.98s)]
*  That was with Obama. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=478.82s)]
*  But this is your president. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=479.82s)]
*  It was your president. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=480.82s)]
*  That was with Obama who gave you sheets and I gave you javelins. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=482.65999999999997s)]
*  I gave you the javelins to take out all those tanks. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=485.98s)]
*  Obama gave you sheets. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=489.21999999999997s)]
*  In fact, the statement is Obama gave sheets and Trump gave javelins. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=491.74s)]
*  You got to be more thankful because let me tell you, you don't have the cards. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=497.34s)]
*  With us, you have the cards. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=501.84s)]
*  But without us, you don't have any cards. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=503.82s)]
*  All I can say is this. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=506.14s)]
*  He might have broken deals with Obama and Bush and he might have broken them with Biden. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=508.14000000000004s)]
*  He did maybe. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=513.26s)]
*  Maybe he didn't. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=514.26s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=515.26s)]
*  But he didn't break them with me. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=516.26s)]
*  He wants to make a deal. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=517.86s)]
*  I don't know if you can make a deal. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=518.86s)]
*  The problem is I've empowered you to be a tough guy. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=520.94s)]
*  And I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=525.4200000000001s)]
*  And your people are very brave. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=528.74s)]
*  But you're either going to make a deal or we're out. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=530.8000000000001s)]
*  And if we're out, you'll fight it out. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=533.44s)]
*  I don't think it's going to be pretty, but you'll fight it out. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=536.38s)]
*  But you don't have the cards. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=540.1800000000001s)]
*  But once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=541.74s)]
*  But you're not acting at all thankful. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=545.5s)]
*  And that's not a nice thing. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=547.7s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=548.7s)]
*  That's not a nice thing. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBnbr6ScHA&t=549.7s)]
