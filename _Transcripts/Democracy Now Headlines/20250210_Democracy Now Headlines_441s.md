President Trump has ordered a freeze on all foreign aid to South Africa in an executive order he signed Friday, claiming that a new land reform law amounts to "government-sponsored race-based discrimination." The country's white minority still owns the vast majority of farmland decades after the end of apartheid rule. Trump also criticized South Africa's genocide case against Israel at the ICJ and said the United States would accept white South Africans as refugees facing what he characterized as persecution. The cuts to aid are already causing widespread suffering in South Africa, where "after 30 years of democracy, not much has changed in terms of wealth ownership" and a white population with colonial roots is "using politics, ideology, misinformation and propaganda â€¦ to maintain the status quo," says South African activist Trevor Ngwane.

*  Trump's order also offered refugee status in the United States to white South Africans, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  Afrikaners, who are, quote, victims of unjust racial discrimination. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=99.39999999999999s)]

*  All of this comes as the South African-born billionaire, the richest man in the world, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=110.44s)]
*  Elon Musk, now a leader in Trump's administration, has said white South Africans have been the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=114.0s)]
*  victims of, quote, racist ownership laws and accused the post-apartheid government of anti-white [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=117.8s)]
*  racism. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=121.92s)]
*  Last week, Musk's 78-year-old father, Errol Musk, said an adviser to South African President [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=122.92s)]
*  Cyril Rambaposa asked him to help. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=128.92s)]
*  I was asked if I can arrange a quick talk between Errol Rambaposa and Elon. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, that's fine. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=136.88s)]
*  So, I said, all right. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=138.36s)]
*  So, I did. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=140.72s)]
*  And then they spoke a few minutes later, and it's on my phone. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=141.72s)]
*  I can only imagine that Elon would have said, look, we want to help you, but you have to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  quit this war on white people in South Africa. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  Errol Musk is Elon Musk's father. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, has increasingly embraced far-right leaders in [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=161.84s)]
*  the South. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=166.56s)]
*  In a minute, we'll also look at how Musk is part of the PayPal mafia of libertarian [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=167.56s)]
*  billionaires with roots in South Africa under white rule, who now hold powerful positions [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=174.36s)]
*  in the tech industry and politics and surround the White House. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  But we begin in Johannesburg with Trevor Nguane, Soweto-based activist and sure of the United [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=184.56s)]
*  Front, umbrella body of community and labor organizations. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=189.04s)]
*  Welcome back, Trevor, to Democracy Now! [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=191.96s)]
*  Talk about the effects of this immediate cutting off of all USA to South Africa, your [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=194.28s)]
*  country. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Amy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's terrible, because remember that there's a lot of programs here which rely [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  on American funding. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=211.0s)]
*  The HIV program, PEPFOR, 17% of the programs are funded by money from America. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=214.76s)]
*  And with one stroke, all those services were stopped because no money came through and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=225.2s)]
*  millions of people are suffering, including other community, social and health programs. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=233.28s)]
*  So this is very bad for the people here in South Africa. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's very interesting you mentioned PEPFOR. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  Let's remember that it was established by the former Republican president of the United [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=247.48s)]
*  States, George W. Bush, what many call perhaps the most important achievement of his presidency. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=253.68s)]
*  The significance when you talk, Trevor, looking back at the end of apartheid, 94 white South [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=261.96s)]
*  Africans who make up, what, 7% of the population, only in farms that make up about half of South [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=269.4s)]
*  Africa. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=275.44s)]
*  What are your thoughts on the information or misinformation we're getting in the United [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=277.8s)]
*  States about land seizures from Donald Trump and from the South African-born Elon Musk? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=282.52s)]
*  Well, white people, you know, are sitting pretty. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=289.92s)]
*  They manage to hang on to most of their wealth. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=295.96s)]
*  Due to global and local economic processes, the rich continue to get richer and the poor [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=300.68s)]
*  get poorer. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=308.28s)]
*  Most of the farmland, more than 70% of it is owned by white farmers. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=310.44s)]
*  So basically, they're sitting pretty. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=317.88s)]
*  They've got nothing to complain about. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=319.68s)]
*  Perhaps, Amy, you know, they're saying the guilty are afraid. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=323.16s)]
*  Perhaps they know that this unjust situation, where a tiny minority enjoys, you know, most [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=328.20000000000005s)]
*  of the country's wealth and resources, is not tenable. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=336.76000000000005s)]
*  And sooner or later, it will have to end. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=340.72s)]
*  And finally, Trevor, President Trump welcoming Afrikaner refugees into the United States [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  because flight after flight takes immigrants from the United States, for example, to Guantanamo. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=352.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, the white people here are not interested in going to the USA because they're [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=361.96s)]
*  having a good life here. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=373.28s)]
*  The only thing that is bothering them is what I can call white fears in the face of [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=375.24s)]
*  black aspirations, indeed black frustrations, because after 30 years of democracy, not much [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=383.40000000000003s)]
*  has changed in terms of, you know, wealth, ownership, in terms of basic improvement in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=391.16s)]
*  the everyday lives of the people. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=399.12s)]
*  They are human beings. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=403.8s)]
*  They can see that the suffering continues. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=404.8s)]
*  They're just guilty. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=406.64s)]
*  And they know that they should not give away some of their wealth, but they are not prepared. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=408.56s)]
*  So they are using politics, ideology, misinformation and propaganda, some of them, you know, to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  maintain the status quo. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=421.92s)]
*  Trevor Nguane is joining us from Johannesburg, South Africa. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrb_wFJYtrg&t=425.48s)]
