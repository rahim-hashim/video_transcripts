Dr. Khaled Alser, a renowned Palestinian surgeon at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, describes how Israeli forces abducted him from Gaza last year before transferring him to Israeli prisons rife with abuse. He was held by Israel for seven months last year, during which time he says he was beaten, humiliated, denied medical treatment and tortured. He also describes routine sexual assault and sexual humiliation of prisoners by Israeli soldiers, as well as the use of military attack dogs on the detainees. No charges were filed against Alser before he was released back to Gaza. "Most of the prisoners I met inside the prison are civilians or civil workers here, working inside hospitals, schools, universities," Alser tells Democracy Now! from Gaza. "We as healthcare workers, we don't have any agenda against anyone. We just provide medical care."

*  Dr. Khaled Al-Ser, we're going to begin with you in Gaza, outside the hospital, where [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=190.34s)]
*  you work. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=198.51999999999998s)]

*  Can you explain what happened to you? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=204.88s)]
*  Khaled, to you and to your audience, it happened to me last March, 2024. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=208.32s)]
*  I was working in this hospital after it has been destructed by the Israeli army, IDF. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=221.0s)]
*  They destroyed all of the department. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=226.92s)]
*  At that time, we tried to reopen the hospital again, trying to clean the floors, clean [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=229.28s)]
*  the department, trying to open it as a medical point at least to receive casualty. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=234.88s)]
*  Back in March, there was a lot of threats against Palestinian Rafah, that Netanyahu [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  threat that he will invade Rafah. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=247.0s)]
*  We tried to prepare the hospital to receive casualty at that time. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=249.12s)]
*  We were surprised that the soldiers invaded the whole city and the hospital zone within [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  one hour, shooting anyone walking in the street. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=259.8s)]
*  They brought a siege around the hospital for two days. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  After that, they ordered us to go outside the building. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=266.72s)]
*  They ordered us to take off our clothes. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  They brought us naked, handcuffed from behind with plastic tie. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=274.12s)]
*  They put a plastic on our ankles with blindfolds over our eyes. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=281.12s)]
*  They kept us under interrogation here near the hospital in a civilian building for five [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=285.52s)]
*  days under continuous interrogation from their soldiers. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=292.56s)]
*  At that time, I have been asked several questions. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=297.76s)]
*  All of them are related to my job. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=304.12s)]
*  They did not know anything about me. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  They did not know Khaled. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=308.52s)]
*  They only asked one question. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=309.88s)]
*  They asked me about my job as a general surgeon here at Nasr Hospital, what I did during the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=312.32s)]
*  war inside the hospital. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=319.88s)]
*  And after that, this was the only question they decided to take me to the prison for. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=322.36s)]
*  So, can you explain where you were taken to, Dr. Al-Sadr? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=328.84s)]
*  Explain the interrogations you went through. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=336.32s)]
*  I was under interrogation like five times, two times here in the hospital field during [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=339.28s)]
*  the invasion of the soldier to the hospital zone. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=351.96s)]
*  And after that, they took me in a military vehicle going toward Israel. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  During my stay inside the prison, I did not know anything about my position, which prison [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=362.52s)]
*  I am in, except one time when I had a visit from my lawyer who told me that I was in Sidi [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=368.8s)]
*  Timan prison for three months. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=376.68s)]
*  And after that, they sent me on 18th of June to offer military camp in prison. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=379.2s)]
*  All of these prisons are new prisons, developed or established during October 7 war. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=386.92s)]
*  And most of the prisoners I met inside the prison are civilians or civil workers here [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  working inside the hospital, school, universities during the interrogation here in the field. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=400.44s)]
*  And inside the prison, they took me three times to the interrogation, all of the questions [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  related to the hospital, to the department in the hospital, if I saw any hostages inside [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=411.72s)]
*  the hospital. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=417.24s)]
*  And that's all. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=418.72s)]
*  And even after two months, before any interrogation inside, they decided to make like a fake court [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=420.56s)]
*  for me. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=425.8s)]
*  They took me outside the prison in Sidi Timan. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=427.24s)]
*  I was in Sidi Timan. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=430.24s)]
*  They called my name. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=431.64s)]
*  They took me outside the prison, handcuffed me from behind, and my cover, they covering [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=432.88s)]
*  my eye with a piece of cloth. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=438.52s)]
*  And they put me in the chair. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  And after they removed the blindfold, I was surprised with a video call on the phone, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=442.36s)]
*  someone telling me that you are now in a court and you are charged to be a terrorist, to [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=448.76000000000005s)]
*  be inside the prison until the end of the war. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=455.0s)]
*  Without any prior announcement, I go with the man who was talking with me, that I did [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=458.0s)]
*  not have any legal consultation. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=464.36s)]
*  I did not have a chance to call any lawyer. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  But they ignore anything we talk. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=469.24s)]
*  They just want to take the picture and the video for us, charging us with a fake charge. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=471.56s)]
*  And actually, I did not have an actual interrogation or an actual saying for me before this court. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=478.08s)]
*  In June, they took me twice to the interrogation with the same question. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=486.4s)]
*  All of them regarded my work at Nasr Hospital during the war in the general surgery department. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=490.88s)]
*  Can you talk about who ran the prison and how they punish prisoners? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=498.84s)]
*  Are we talking about the notorious Zditteman, or were you also at Ofer? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  Can you talk about what I was reading about your testimony, beatings and unleashing pepper [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=512.4399999999999s)]
*  spray in the face? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=518.16s)]
*  If I want to talk about the brutality of the soldiers inside Zditteman, I will take more [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=526.4399999999999s)]
*  than one day or two days speaking in details about their brutality. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=532.5200000000001s)]
*  In short, anyone inside Zditteman at least once face beating by batons, by fist kicking, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=536.6s)]
*  or even get bitten by the dogs. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=544.6800000000001s)]
*  They enter every one week or twice weekly. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=547.6s)]
*  They have Force 100. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=551.2s)]
*  They enter without a prior warning or announcement inside the place. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=553.48s)]
*  It's not a prison. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=557.96s)]
*  It's just an open area closed with a metallic fence. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=558.96s)]
*  They enter this area with 100 prisoners. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=562.28s)]
*  They order all the prisoners on their tummy and after that they choose randomly anyone [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=565.64s)]
*  inside the prison to beat him with a baton or to spray him with a pepper spray. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=570.6s)]
*  And sometimes I heard a lot of testimony from prisoners inside the prison. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=577.24s)]
*  They came to me seeking medical advice because they have sexually assaulted by the soldiers [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=581.72s)]

*  Sometimes they spray their faces and their private parts by pepper spray. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=594.72s)]
*  All of this happened to me every one week. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=599.08s)]
*  We have one incident of invasion of these force to stay inside Zditteman. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=601.72s)]

*  They are kidnapped. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iySQZSvxLM&t=813.7800000000001s)]
