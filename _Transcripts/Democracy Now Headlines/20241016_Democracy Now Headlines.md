# Top U.S. & World Headlines — October 16, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsPa044YEYE)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Oxfam and over 35 other humanitarian groups have issued a dire warning about Israel's
*  siege on northern Gaza.
*  In a statement, the group said, quote, The Israeli forces' assault on Gaza has escalated
*  to a horrifying level of atrocity.
*  Northern Gaza is being wiped off the map, they wrote.
*  Israel's barred all food into the area while attacks on displaced people continue.
*  Meanwhile, the Biden administration sent Israel a written warning that the U.S. may cut off
*  military assistance if Israel does not boost humanitarian aid access to Gaza within the
*  next 30 days.
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin wrote, quote, We're
*  now writing to underscore the U.S. government's deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian
*  situation in Gaza and seek urgent and sustained actions by your government this month to reverse
*  this trajectory, end quote.
*  The Biden administration has continued to arm Israel despite findings by its own experts
*  at USAID and the State Department that Israel's routinely impeded delivery of food and medicine
*  in violation of U.S. law.
*  On Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Matt Miller faced numerous questions about
*  U.S. policy.
*  This is Reuters journalist, Homera Pamuk.
*  Given you are already saying humanitarian assistance is very low and putting in front
*  of Israel a bunch of concrete measures on how to improve it, why are you waiting for
*  another 30 days to implement the law?
*  Because we believe it's appropriate to give them a chance to cure the problem.
*  Other outlets have reported that Reuters has reported all the way back in April that officials
*  from this department have assessed in internal memos that Israel, quote, is persistently
*  and arbitrarily impeding aid in Gaza.
*  So if the law is already being like, I mean, if it's already doing it, why is the United
*  States waiting?
*  So first of all, that is not—so we've been over this before, I know, from this
*  podium.
*  There are people that reach that conclusion, and there are people inside this building
*  who reach the opposite conclusion.
*  So I think it's important to state that for the record.
*  In Lebanon, Israel attacked a municipal building in the southern town of Nabatea, killing six
*  people, including the town's mayor.
*  The BBC reports the mayor and other city workers were killed while holding a meeting to discuss
*  coordinating aid for civilians remaining in the area.
*  Israel also bombed the village of Khana, striking a healthcare center and several homes, killing
*  at least 15 people.
*  Israel also bombed the southern suburbs of Beirut just hours after the U.S. State Department
*  said it opposes the, quote, scope and nature of Israel's attacks on Beirut.
*  As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismisses calls for a ceasefire, the U.N. Refugee Agency
*  is warning a quarter of Lebanon is now under forced evacuation orders from Israel.
*  Israeli airstrikes and Israeli evacuation orders continue to increase the areas impacted.
*  So now that we have over 25 percent of the country under a direct Israeli military evacuation
*  order, just yesterday we had another 20 villages issued with an evacuation order in the south
*  of the country.
*  In Georgia, more than 325,000 voters cast ballots Tuesday on the first day of early
*  voting here in the United States.
*  That's more than twice the previous record set four years ago.
*  Meanwhile, a Georgia judge has blocked a controversial new rule set by the Georgia State Election
*  Board that would have required election workers to hand count the number of ballots cast
*  in each precinct on Election Day.
*  More questions are being raised about Trump's mental state after a town hall event in Pennsylvania
*  took an unexpected turn Monday when two audience members fainted.
*  Trump ended up taking just five questions from the crowd before making this announcement.
*  Let's not do any more questions.
*  Let's just listen to music.
*  Let's make it into our music.
*  Who the hell wants to hear questions?
*  For the next more than 30 minutes, Trump's staff played music while the former president
*  swayed and bopped to the music on stage, along with South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, who
*  was hosting the town hall.
*  Trump eventually left the stage without taking any more questions.
*  On Tuesday, Kamala Harris responded to Trump's town hall by writing online, quote,
*  I hope he's OK.
*  On Tuesday, Trump appeared at the Economic Club of Chicago, where he was grilled about
*  reports that his economic proposals could devastate the U.S. economy.
*  He was asked by Bloomberg editor-in-chief John McElligweight, who cited a recent study
*  by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
*  If you add up all the promises you've made, then your plans would add $7.5 trillion to
*  the debt.
*  That's more than twice the total for Vice President Harris.
*  You're on course to push up debt up to 150 percent of GDP.
*  This is a very businesslike audience.
*  Why should they trust you with that?
*  Because we're about growth.
*  She's got no growth whatsoever, and we're all about growth.
*  In other election news, newly disclosed federal filings show multi-billionaire Elon Musk has
*  officially become one of Donald Trump's biggest financial backers.
*  Musk gave around $75 million to his pro-Trump super PAC in the last quarter.
*  Meanwhile, Miriam Adelson, the billionaire wife of the late casino magnate Sheldon Adelson,
*  gave $95 million to her pro-Trump super PAC.
*  Earlier this year, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported Miriam Adelson is pushing Trump to
*  support Israel annexing the entire Occupied West Bank.
*  On Tuesday, the popular radio host Charlemagne the God interviewed Kamala Harris in Detroit
*  in what was billed as an audio town hall.
*  During the event, Harris agreed that Trump's vision for the country could be described
*  as fascism.
*  The other Donald Trump is about taking us backward.
*  The other is about fascism.
*  Why can't we just say it?
*  The World Food Program's warning millions of people in southern Africa are facing the
*  region's worst food crisis in decades due to a devastating drought.
*  Five countries—Lasutu, Malawi, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe—have already declared
*  national disasters.
*  The World Food Program said Tuesday the drought could deepen into a full-scale humanitarian
*  crisis.
*  A historic drought, the worst food crisis yet, has devastated more than 27 million lives
*  across the region.
*  Some 21 million children in southern Africa are malnourished.
*  For many communities, this is the worst food crisis in decades.
*  North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper says 92 people are still missing in the state after
*  Hurricane Helene devastated the city of Asheville and other mountain communities over two weeks
*  ago.
*  The storm's death toll stands at around 250 across six states.
*  The number of migrants dying in New Mexico near the U.S.-Mexico border has increased
*  tenfold over the past five years.
*  Over 220 bodies have been found since January of last year.
*  Many of the victims are believed to have died from dehydration and malnutrition as they
*  attempt to cross scorching hot desert or mountain areas to seek refuge in the United States.
*  Google has announced plans to build seven nuclear reactors in the United States to help
*  power the company's data centers and artificial intelligence systems.
*  The announcement comes just a month after Microsoft said it would fund the reopening
*  of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, the site of the worst nuclear disaster in U.S.
*  history.
*  And music mogul Sean Diddy Combs is facing six new rape and sexual assault lawsuits.
*  Combs has been jailed since mid-September after pleading not guilty to federal racketeering,
*  conspiracy, sex trafficking and other charges.
*  The attorney Tony Busby has said is representing more than 120 people who have made sexual
*  assault and rape allegations against Combs, who was once one of the most powerful figures
*  in the entertainment world.
*  Meanwhile, Los Angeles Times reveals new details about how Combs attacked a UCLA football coach
*  and choked an intern in the coach's office in 2015 in a dispute over how the coach treated
*  Combs' son.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
