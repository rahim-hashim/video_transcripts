Palestinian writer Mosab Abu Toha has just been awarded the 2025 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for his essays about the Palestinian experience in the face of the U.S.-backed Israeli assault on Gaza. He joins Democracy Now! to discuss his work, the necessity of advocating for Palestinian rights, and the violence of Israeli occupation. Abu Toha, who evacuated Gaza in late 2023 after being arrested, beaten and detained by the Israeli military, now resides in Syracuse, New York. He says that, while grateful for the platform granted by the Pulitzer, he cannot celebrate the achievement while "my sisters, my brothers and my parents in Gaza are starving." Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip has trapped millions of Palestinians in famine conditions, unable to evacuate and under threat of daily bombings and Israeli troop movements. "The only celebration for me is when there is an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza [and] the West Bank, and when justice and peace are served in Palestine," says Abu Toha.

*  Reuters reports it could include all of Gaza's territory. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=113.48s)]

*  On Monday, he won a Pulitzer Prize for commentary for his writings in the New Yorker magazine. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  He was praised for his, quote, essays on the physical and emotional carnage in Gaza that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=129.98000000000002s)]

*  of more than a year and a half of war with Israel, unquote. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=143.12s)]

*  First, Masab, it's terrible to say in light of what's happening in Gaza to start off [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=163.48s)]
*  by saying congratulations, but, wow, you just won the Pulitzer Prize. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=168.84s)]
*  Talk about what this means to you and the statement you put out as you learned of this [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=176.36s)]
*  huge honor. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=183.56s)]
*  First of all, I would like to thank you, Amy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=185.4s)]
*  Appreciate your work. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=189.4s)]
*  Appreciate Democracy Now. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=190.4s)]
*  Thank you so much for your voice. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=191.4s)]
*  This honor has brought to me tears and joy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=194.4s)]
*  I mean, joy because this is a big prize. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=199.4s)]
*  This is something that every writer and artist and journalist, and the world, and the world [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=206.4s)]
*  and artists and journalists dreams of winning. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=214.24s)]
*  But this is also very sad for me because the pieces for which I won the prize, the four [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=217.24s)]
*  pieces, I mean, I wrote about seven or eight pieces for the New Yorker. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=224.24s)]
*  This prize was awarded to four of my pieces. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=228.44s)]
*  The four pieces are one for, one about an article that I wrote about starvation in Gaza. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  The other one was about the difficulty of traveling as a Palestinian. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=241.32000000000002s)]
*  The third one was about the loss of the refugee camp. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  And the fourth was about the Gaza we leave behind. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=247.32000000000002s)]
*  And unfortunately, as I'm looking at the titles of these essays, the situation in Gaza is [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=253.32000000000002s)]
*  worsening. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=259.32s)]
*  I mean, not day after day, but minute after minute. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=260.32s)]
*  And people are dying. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=263.32s)]
*  I mean, children are dying of hunger. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=264.32s)]
*  People are dying for lack of not only food, but also medicine. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=268.28s)]
*  So, this prize means a lot to me, but it also reminds me that there is a lot to work on, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=272.28s)]
*  not only by writing, but also encouraging people who have the power to take action to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=279.28s)]
*  stop all of this. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=287.28s)]
*  And Mosab, I wanted to ask you, given the fact of the continuing attacks of the Israelis [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=291.23999999999995s)]
*  in Gaza and all the complete failure of the world community to be able to do anything [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=297.23999999999995s)]
*  to stop Israel, your sense of what you're seeing in terms of the American public, since [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=303.23999999999995s)]
*  you've been in the United States, in terms of its response to the war? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=311.23999999999995s)]
*  I think the American public and also people around the world are eager to learn. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=317.2s)]
*  I mean, unfortunately, the mainstream media is not doing enough. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=325.2s)]
*  Israel has been preventing people from visiting Gaza, not only after October 7th, but even [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=330.2s)]
*  before, but especially after October 7th. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=338.2s)]
*  Journalists, medics, a few number, very, very little number of doctors have been allowed [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  to go to Gaza. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  I think the American people need to hear more and more voices. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, my voice is only one voice that is necessary to hear, but there are so many other [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  voices that are there still in Gaza. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think the American public is eager to learn about journalists and writers and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=368.12s)]
*  artists and university professors who have so many stories to tell. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=373.12s)]
*  My story is one story. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=379.12s)]
*  My story is other people's story. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=381.12s)]
*  But we need to hear more and more people. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=384.12s)]
*  And I think that the American public is truly eager and not only eager, but I mean, they [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=387.12s)]
*  are eager to hear and learn about more and more stories in Gaza. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=395.08s)]
*  And I'm happy that my power pieces that won these awards are stories that I wrote about [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=398.08s)]
*  myself, about my people in Gaza, about the refugee camp where I was born. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=405.08s)]
*  My family members were killed. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=411.08s)]
*  My students, my great aunt whose body is still undeveloped until today since last October. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=413.08s)]
*  So there are so many other stories that are to be heard. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=422.03999999999996s)]
*  And I hope that the American magazines and newspapers and the American channels, the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=426.03999999999996s)]
*  news channels would open up their spaces to let these writers and people in Gaza share [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=432.03999999999996s)]
*  their stories because this is what we should be doing. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  At least, I mean, killing people in Gaza is one crime, but also not giving them the space [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=442.03999999999996s)]
*  to talk about their pain and also demands because all the time we hear politicians. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=449.04s)]
*  Yesterday we heard President Trump saying that we want to help the people of Gaza. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=454.0s)]
*  They have to move. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=460.0s)]
*  We will feed them. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=462.0s)]
*  But I mean, come on, I mean, we are not people who need to be fed. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=463.0s)]
*  We are not hungry because we don't have food. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=466.0s)]
*  We are hungry because we are under occupation. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=469.0s)]
*  We are under siege. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=471.0s)]
*  We are under genocide. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=472.0s)]
*  This is not what people in Gaza want. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=473.0s)]
*  It's not that they want only to eat. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=476.0s)]
*  They want freedom. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=478.96s)]
*  This is what we want. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=479.96s)]
*  Mas'ab Abu Touha, I want to turn to speaking at the Jewish Voice for Peace national meeting [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=480.96s)]
*  this weekend. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=489.96s)]
*  You read If I Must Die by the great Palestinian poet killed in Ra'afah, Raffat al-Ariyad. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=491.96s)]
*  If I must die by Raffat al-Ariyad. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=499.96s)]
*  If I must die, you must live, to tell my story, to sell my things, to buy a piece of cloth [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=505.91999999999996s)]
*  and some strings, make it white with a long tail so that a child somewhere in Gaza while [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=512.92s)]
*  looking heaven in the eye, awaiting his dad who left in a blaze, and bid no one farewell, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=518.92s)]
*  not even to his flesh, not even to himself, see the kite, my kite you made, flying up [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=524.92s)]
*  and thinks for a moment an angel is there, bringing back love. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=531.88s)]
*  If I must die, let it bring hope. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=535.88s)]
*  Let it be a tale. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=538.88s)]
*  If I must die. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=541.88s)]
*  Mas'ab Abu Touha, you reference Raffat in winning the Pulitzer Prize yesterday. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=543.88s)]
*  Talk about your relationship with him, who he was and what he means for the people of [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=552.88s)]
*  Palestine. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=559.84s)]
*  Yeah, I talked a lot about Raffat. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=560.84s)]
*  I wrote about him. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=562.84s)]
*  Raffat was a university professor who was murdered, and this is not mentioned a lot. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=563.84s)]
*  He was not only murdered alone. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=569.4s)]
*  He was murdered along with two of his siblings and four nephews. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=571.4s)]
*  Raffat died while he was holding a pen in his hand, while he was wearing his glasses, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=575.12s)]
*  and writing more poems to us, asking us to continue his message, which is the tale of [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=582.32s)]
*  every people who are oppressed by occupation, who are under siege, who are dying in a genocide. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=590.32s)]
*  If I must die, let it bring hope. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=596.32s)]
*  Let it be a tale. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=599.32s)]
*  If he must die, we need to tell Raffat's tale. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=600.32s)]
*  We need to, I mean, as I said before, if I must die, this is a question of the future. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=604.32s)]
*  Is there a crime for someone to die to be killed by occupation? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=612.32s)]
*  And we have to remember here that 70% of the population in Gaza are refugees. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=615.32s)]
*  So, these refugees, they have stories. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=620.32s)]
*  It's not that they were killed by an occupation. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=622.32s)]
*  No, they were killed as they have dreamed all their lives to return to their homeland. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=625.32s)]
*  So, Raffat died with two of his siblings and four nephews. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=630.32s)]
*  And in the past, he lost another brother in 2014. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=635.32s)]
*  So, Raffat was not only a writer. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=638.32s)]
*  He was not only a university professor, but he was also a mentor for so many young writers. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=642.0400000000001s)]
*  He introduced me to the We Are Not Numbers project in 2014 after the Israeli 51-day attack [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=646.0400000000001s)]
*  on Gaza, which claimed the lives of three close friends of mine, about whom I wrote [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=652.0400000000001s)]
*  in my poetry and in my essays. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=656.5400000000001s)]
*  So, Raffat was more than—I mean, it is a huge loss. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=658.5400000000001s)]
*  And this is why we have to honor his memory by continuing to tell the tales, not only—and [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=663.5400000000001s)]
*  Raffat said, let it be a tale. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=670.26s)]
*  It's not only Raffat's tale, because Raffat's tale, my tale, my grandparents' tale, are [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=672.26s)]
*  the tales of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=678.26s)]
*  And our tales are not only Palestinian tales. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=681.26s)]
*  It is a human tale of loss after loss after loss, while the world is watching us. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=684.26s)]
*  So, we refuse to die just like that. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=692.26s)]
*  We will fight to live, not only to live, but also to tell the stories of those who died [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=695.98s)]
*  before us, who were meant to die in blindness, to die in darkness. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=701.98s)]
*  No, we will live, we will fight, we will continue to speak up, because this loss, the loss of [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=707.98s)]
*  Raffat and so many hundreds of my friends and family members, should not be a waste. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=714.98s)]
*  We should tell the stories of these people, because we don't want to lose more people. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=721.7s)]
*  When we write a poem, it's not because we feel pain for those who we lost, but we are [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=725.7s)]
*  trying to stir people into action when they feel what we are feeling. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=730.7s)]
*  And, Mosab, you have been telling the stories of what has been going on there through your [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=734.7s)]
*  poetry and writing, but even in the United States, it has not been easy. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=741.9s)]
*  I mean, the right-wing groups have called for deporting you, and President Trump is [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=745.9s)]
*  cracking down on non-citizens critical of Israel. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=752.02s)]
*  Talk about the problems you've had even being able to speak at many universities. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=755.54s)]
*  I mean, this is the tragedy of being a Palestinian or being a pro-Palestinian human rights. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=763.54s)]
*  You are not safe living in Palestine, for example, in my case in Gaza. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=770.54s)]
*  I was wounded at the age of 16 in an airstrike that killed seven people. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=776.18s)]
*  I lost three close friends of mine in 2014. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=780.18s)]
*  I was abducted by the Israeli forces in November 2023. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=783.18s)]
*  I lost my house, which is my family house, in October 2023. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=788.18s)]
*  Two of my brothers-in-law were abducted by the Israeli forces, and we don't know anything [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=793.18s)]
*  about them. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=800.18s)]
*  And I lost so many members of my family, as I said. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=801.18s)]
*  And I survived, by the way, airstrikes. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=804.8199999999999s)]
*  I mean, airstrikes that were just two houses away from me, in Jabalia Camp or in Bethlehem. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=806.8199999999999s)]
*  So it is—I mean, to live in Gaza is very dangerous. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=812.8199999999999s)]
*  So I didn't feel safe living in Gaza. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=816.8199999999999s)]
*  And now when I'm traveling outside of Gaza, not only in the United States, I don't feel [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=819.8199999999999s)]
*  safe, because, I mean, we are not usually welcome anywhere. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=823.8199999999999s)]
*  It's not only in the United States, but it's most of the world. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=826.8199999999999s)]
*  And now when we come to the United States, you know, to raise our families and to share [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=831.46s)]
*  the stories of people who we lost, I mean, I'm not talking about another people. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=835.46s)]
*  So this is what is different about me as Musa. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=840.46s)]
*  I'm not talking about other people. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=843.46s)]
*  I'm talking about myself. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=845.46s)]
*  I'm talking about my siblings, about my parents, about my grandparents. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=846.46s)]
*  I'm talking about the graves of my grandparents, who I will never find because Israel destroyed [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=849.46s)]
*  cemeteries. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=854.46s)]
*  I will not take my grandchildren and show them the kindergarten which I attended, not [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=856.1s)]
*  my university, from where I graduated, in Gaza. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=861.1s)]
*  I mean, to come here and speak about these things is not even welcome. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=866.1s)]
*  So what should I do as Palestinian? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=871.1s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=874.1s)]
*  I mean, we—I mean, this world doesn't make sense. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=875.1s)]
*  In Gaza, you will be—you will get killed, wounded or abducted. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=878.1s)]
*  When you go out and try to speak about these things, you are being chased by these hate [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=882.74s)]
*  groups, these extremist groups. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=887.74s)]
*  So what do they want from me? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=889.74s)]
*  And when they talk about deportation, I mean, someone would deport someone to their homeland. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=891.74s)]
*  But my homeland is occupied. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=899.74s)]
*  I wish I could go back to Gaza. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=901.74s)]
*  But before you deport me back to Gaza, I need to be in Gaza where Palestine is free. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=903.74s)]
*  I need to go back to a country that is not only under occupation, but that is undergoing genocide. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=912.38s)]
*  So I would love to go back to Gaza. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=919.38s)]
*  I mean, it is not my biggest dream to live in the United States. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=921.38s)]
*  My biggest dream is to live in my free homeland in Palestine, to be able to visit the original [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=925.38s)]
*  home city and live in the original home city of my grandparents, Yaffa, which is also the [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=932.38s)]
*  name of my 80-year-old daughter. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=938.38s)]
*  This is where I would like to be deported. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=942.02s)]
*  I would like to go back and live in a free Palestine. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=944.02s)]
*  Masab, I want to thank you so much for taking this time to talk with us. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=950.02s)]
*  I'm so sorry also that you had to cancel your tour all over the country. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=954.02s)]
*  You apologized to people at all the universities where you were going to be speaking, saying [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=958.02s)]
*  how much you looked forward to sharing a forest of noise with them. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=963.02s)]
*  I want to congratulate you on your son's birthday this weekend, as you were at Jewish [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=968.66s)]
*  Voice for Peace speaking and reading your poetry. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=972.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=976.86s)]
*  And also ask if at Syracuse University, where you are now, if they'll be holding a big [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=977.86s)]
*  celebration, you are now a Pulitzer Prize winner, as was announced yesterday. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=981.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, yes, I'm looking forward to celebrate, but as you understand, it is not [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=988.86s)]
*  easy for me to celebrate anything. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=995.86s)]
*  I mean, during some of the events, people would be dancing on music. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=998.7s)]
*  I mean, I do not feel fine, you know, celebrating something. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=1003.7s)]
*  The only celebration is, for me, is when there is an immediate and permanent ceasefire in [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=1008.7s)]
*  Gaza and also in the West Bank, and when justice and peace are served in Palestine. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=1015.7s)]
*  This is the only reason for me to celebrate. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=1021.7s)]
*  I can't celebrate while I know that my sisters, my brothers and my parents in Gaza are starving. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=1025.54s)]
*  You know, I'm sending them this good news, telling them that this is my hope that my [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=1031.54s)]
*  voice would reach more and more people who have the power to intervene and stop this suffering. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=1035.54s)]
*  I can't just dance or eat, you know, cake or just, you know, I mean, it is not normal for me. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=1041.54s)]
*  But what is good about this is that this recognition, I hope, would prove to be a step towards greater [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=1048.3799999999999s)]
*  understanding and would stir people in power to take action, to put an end, because I don't [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=1057.3799999999999s)]
*  want to continue writing essays and poems about these painful memories and these painful [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=1064.3799999999999s)]
*  realities. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=1070.3799999999999s)]
*  Masa'a Babu Toha, thank you so much. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-9-hubh5w&t=1072.3799999999999s)]
