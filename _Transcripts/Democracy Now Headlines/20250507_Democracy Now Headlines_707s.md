Dozens of people have been killed in the worst fighting between India and Pakistan in more than two decades. India attacked nine locations in Pakistan and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir early Wednesday, killing at least 26 people, including a child. Pakistan described the attacks as an act of war and responded by shelling areas controlled by India. Tensions have been soaring between the two nuclear-armed states since gunmen massacred 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir in a rampage that India blamed on Pakistan.

Kashmiri journalist and award-winning novelist Mirza Waheed says that as the countries fight, the people of Kashmir get left behind. “When elephants fight, it’s the grass that gets trampled upon,” said Waheed.

*  Once More Kashmiri Voices Are Missing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=87.08s)]
*  Well, they're not missing here, Mirza Waheed. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  So if you can start off by talking about what's at stake right now and give us the progression [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=93.04s)]
*  of what took place. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=98.9s)]
*  First, the attack on Indian tourists in Indian-administered Pakistan—in Indian-administered Kashmir [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=100.44s)]
*  and what that means. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=108.24s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=109.24s)]
*  Those killings were reprehensible, and it was a massacre of Indian tourists in a pristine, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=113.24s)]
*  really idyllic meadow in Pahalgam, where I lived as a child. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  And it's a very gorgeous and beautiful place. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=125.56s)]
*  And those killings were shocking, obviously, and condemnable, reprehensible, and that is [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=128.92s)]
*  the main trigger for this recent escalation now, because soon after the killings, there [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=137.76s)]
*  was obviously outrage in India, in the public, in the media, across the society and the political [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=145.2s)]
*  classes. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=151.56s)]
*  And very soon we heard big clamors for war, especially in the media. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=152.56s)]
*  There was a lot of pressure to strike on targets in Pakistan, and it was kind of—we knew [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=160.16s)]
*  it was happening. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=167.76s)]
*  Obviously, we had hoped it shouldn't happen. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=168.76s)]
*  It wouldn't happen, but that's what's happened now. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=170.24s)]
*  And in many ways, this is an old war. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=172.84s)]
*  This is a very, very old war, and not as old as the American president believes it to be, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=175.52s)]
*  not centuries old, but about 75 years old. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=179.84s)]
*  My grandfather saw the first India-Pakistan war in 1948. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=184.96s)]
*  My father saw the wars in 1965 and 1971. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=190.0s)]
*  And then in 1999, the limited war over Kurgil. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=194.92s)]
*  And I have seen 1999, and now this recent, the latest escalation. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=199.12s)]
*  This is a dangerous escalation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=204.96s)]
*  It's a dangerous intensification, because as you, as you know, Prelu said, people have [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=206.28s)]
*  been killed on both sides of the border, almost all of them civilians. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=212.6s)]
*  That has to be emphasized and noted, that people who have been killed in the shelling [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  are all civilians. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=225.48s)]
*  And as we speak, in the borderlands between India and Pakistan, the atmosphere of Kashmir, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=227.04s)]
*  people are hiding in makeshift bunkers, in underground shelters. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=234.44s)]
*  Some of them are contemplating leaving. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=240.32s)]
*  The main airport in Kashmir is sealed off, as are other airports in some parts of northern India. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=243.16s)]
*  There's a huge amount of fear in the public. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=251.2s)]
*  And this is that old thing, isn't it, when elephants fight, it's the grass that gets [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=253.56s)]
*  trampled upon. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=258.92s)]
*  So Kashmiris have been kind of in the middle for a long, long time now. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=260.64s)]
*  And it fills me with despair as a Kashmiri person, as a writer, as someone who's kind [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=266.48s)]
*  of thought about it and written about it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=271.36s)]
*  It fills me with a lot of despair. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=273.72s)]
*  And I'm upset about the killings in Pahulgarh, about the subsequent plant down in Kashmir [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=276.04s)]
*  where thousands of people were arrested, houses of families who are linked to Kashmiri militants [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  demolished, and now these strikes and the counteroffensive from Pakistan. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=292.52s)]
*  So I'm really, really upset. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=299.4s)]
*  And I didn't sleep last night because we didn't know what we were going to see in the morning. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  And Mishra Waheed, you mentioned that this has a long history, that there have been numerous [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=308.12s)]
*  conflicts over in past decades. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  But at the heart of it, why has it been so difficult to resolve and why have the Kashmiris [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=317.92s)]
*  fallen under both of a Pakistan-administered territory and India-administered territory? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=323.04s)]
*  I'm going to try and give a basic sort of prime on history. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=330.72s)]
*  See, we go back to the partition. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=333.44s)]
*  India and Pakistan become modern nation states. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=335.44s)]
*  Kashmir is left unresolved. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=338.0s)]
*  Soon they begin their first war over Kashmir in 1948, which is then brought to an end to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  UN mediation. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=346.48s)]
*  There's a ceasefire. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=347.28s)]
*  In fact, it's an interesting thing I must note. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  The line of control that divides two parts of Kashmir right now was actually called a [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=352.88s)]
*  ceasefire line, a CFL, which came into existence soon after the first war I mentioned in 1948. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=358.32s)]
*  And then it was formalized and renamed as line of control in 1972 after India-Pakistan [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=365.11999999999995s)]
*  fought another war, which created the result of the occupation of Bangladesh. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=371.67999999999995s)]
*  So they have fought these wars. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=376.56s)]
*  And it's very clear. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=377.92s)]
*  I mean, they have fought over Kashmir historically all my life and my father's life. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=380.24s)]
*  And there's three generations of Kashmiris and Indians and Pakistanis who have kind of [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=387.12s)]
*  grown old under this threat of war. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=392.64s)]
*  It kind of—there's relative periods of peace between the two countries. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=396.72s)]
*  And then something will bring about a French escalation. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=400.64s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=405.12s)]
*  As the attacks in Pahalgaon have done. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=405.68s)]
*  They haven't been able to solve Kashmir. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  India kind of has—in recent years, claimed that it's kind of brought Kashmir to normalcy. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=412.32s)]
*  But this doesn't look like normalcy to me. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=419.12s)]
*  There's the fighter planes. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=422.16s)]
*  Pakistan claims it's kind of brought down fighter planes. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=424.16s)]
*  India has hit—it's not so unprecedented, because India has hit targets inside [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  Pakistan. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=435.12s)]
*  In previous escalations, previous conflicts, they would hit targets inside Indian Pakistan [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  and inside Kashmir, all of Kashmir being this poor territory. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=443.44s)]
*  But this time, they have gone into targets inside Punjab, inside interior Pakistan, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=446.79999999999995s)]
*  which is what I cited as a very, very dangerous intensification. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=454.15999999999997s)]
*  And how has the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi affected relations between [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=460.72s)]
*  Pakistan and India, his increasingly nationalist stand in India? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=468.88000000000005s)]
*  Yes, it is a different regime than previous regimes. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=477.36s)]
*  They are more open to armed response, which we have seen. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=482.32000000000005s)]
*  And they believe—and they say they had a presser where they said that they have responded [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=488.96s)]
*  in retaliation to the attack in Belga, as they did in 2019 when there was an attack [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=495.36s)]
*  on an Indian paramilitary convoy in Kashmir, in South Kashmir, where—in which about more [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=503.84s)]
*  than 40 Indian paramilitary troopers were killed. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=509.84s)]
*  And then there was a strike in Balochot, which is in Pakistan, I've said, Kashmir. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=512.64s)]
*  But this time, they have kind of gone into—inside Pakistan. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=517.76s)]
*  The Indian government claims that they have resorted to Kashmir, by which I mean they—in [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=524.56s)]
*  2019, they revoked Kashmir's limited autonomy under the law, under Indian dominion, and said, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=530.96s)]
*  now, tourists are coming, it's returned to normalcy, the economy is looking up, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=538.72s)]
*  and Kashmir is normal. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=543.52s)]
*  But it is not normal, because what happens is—you see, you can't impose solutions. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=545.44s)]
*  You can impose order. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  You can impose law and order. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=553.36s)]
*  You can't impose peace. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=555.44s)]
*  And it's clear that this has imposed peace, and it's now blown wide apart. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=557.2s)]
*  And I really, really worry. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=563.6s)]
*  And until they solve Kashmir, my worry is that it's going to come back to haunt the [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=565.12s)]
*  two countries again and again. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=574.72s)]
*  And nobody wants that. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=576.08s)]
*  Nobody wants that. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=577.2s)]
*  Least of all, the Kashmiri people, they are tired. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=578.32s)]
*  They are tired of the enormous, enormous suffering they have seen over the last 30, 40 years. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=580.96s)]
*  Thousands and thousands have killed. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=586.96s)]
*  Kashmiris have been killed. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=588.88s)]
*  And people in India and Pakistan, they have been killed. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=591.04s)]
*  And it's in nobody's interest for this conflict to continue to claim lives like this. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=594.96s)]
*  And I was thinking earlier that I really miss the old days when people used to be [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=603.84s)]
*  opposed to war and warmongering. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=612.16s)]
*  But now we're—we also—I also want to kind of point out that we now at a point in history where—you [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=614.48s)]
*  see, back in the day, we used to look up to the United States and Britain and Europe, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=623.04s)]
*  because phone calls would be expected to be made to the leadership in India and Pakistan [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=628.8s)]
*  urging restraint, urging people, the common minds to prevail and so on and so forth. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=633.52s)]
*  But now that that order is collapsed, post-Raza, it is collapsed. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=639.04s)]
*  I don't think the Americans and the Brits have the same legitimacy. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=645.12s)]
*  I mean, not that they had much back in the day, but, you know, there was at least a semblance [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=649.52s)]
*  of this expectation that phone calls would be made from London and Washington to urge [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=654.56s)]
*  restraint. But I don't think they have the same legitimacy and same influence as they have. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=661.04s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN We just have 30 seconds. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=665.5999999999999s)]
*  These are two nuclear-armed nations. The final comment on the significance of this? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=668.0s)]
*  MIRZA WAHEED SLAVAGIA Stol of Kashmir. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=674.56s)]
*  The two countries have to solve Kashmir, otherwise they'll keep—they'll stay engaged in this [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=677.76s)]
*  forever hole. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=684.24s)]

*  Kashmiri novelist. We'll link to your recent piece. A massacre has reignited the forever war [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts3186dA3Q&t=689.9200000000001s)]
