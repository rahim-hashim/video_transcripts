# Top U.S. & World Headlines — August 21, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix6t6i5AAgc)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, War, Peace and the Presidency.
*  We're breaking with convention.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In Chicago, night two of the Democratic National Convention centered around Kamala Harris's
*  sweeping economic proposals, which includes addressing the housing crisis, canceling medical
*  debt and banning grocery price gouging.
*  Democrats held a ceremonial roll call to nominate Kamala Harris as president and Governor Walz
*  as vice president.
*  She accepted the nomination virtually in Milwaukee, where she and Walz addressed a packed arena,
*  the same site where the RNC was held last month.
*  The second night of the DNC in Chicago was headlined by former First Lady Michelle Obama
*  and former President Barack Obama.
*  We do not need four more years of bluster and bumbling and chaos.
*  We have seen that movie before, and we all know that the sequel is usually worse.
*  America's ready for a new chapter.
*  America's ready for a better story.
*  We are ready for a president, Kamala Harris.
*  Other speakers at the DNC last night included independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who called
*  for expanding healthcare access and raising the minimum wage.
*  He also addressed Israel's war on Gaza.
*  We must end this horrific war in Gaza.
*  Bring home the hostages and demand an immediate ceasefire.
*  During Obama's speech, Jodie Evans, co-founder of the anti-war group Code Pink, unfurled
*  a pink banner inside the DNC that read, Free, Free Palestine.
*  She was then escorted out.
*  An array of anti-Trump Republicans also took to the stage last night to plead their case
*  for Kamala Harris, including former Trump White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.
*  In more news from Chicago, protests continued for a third day inside and outside the DNC.
*  On Tuesday, Code Pink and other pro-Palestine groups disrupted Minnesota governor and Democratic
*  nominee Tim Walz during a women's caucus meeting.
*  Meanwhile several people were arrested Tuesday night outside the Israeli consulate in Chicago
*  As police clashed with dozens of protesters demanding an end to Israel's war on Gaza,
*  the Chicago Tribune reported at least two independent journalists were among those arrested.
*  In other news from the DNC, American doctors who treated patients in Gaza held a news conference
*  Tuesday to shine a light on the ongoing atrocities inflicted by Israel's U.S.-backed war.
*  This is pediatrician Dr. Ahmed Youssef.
*  She had burns that covered over 70% of her surface area, which is a death sentence in
*  an environment where you can't find gauze and there isn't clean water and there aren't antibiotics.
*  We all knew what this meant on the ground in the trauma bay the first minutes we met
*  her.
*  She was going to die there and her baby would die there.
*  And there was nothing we were going to be able to do about it because the Israeli government
*  and the IDF had made it impossible to care for people to the extent which they deserve.
*  Every human being deserves the right to medical aid in that situation.
*  She was no fighter.
*  She was a pregnant woman who was sitting in her home when a bomb dropped on her head.
*  Over 50 Palestinians have been killed over the past day as Israel continues its unrelenting
*  attacks on Gaza.
*  An Israeli strike on another school, this time the Mustafa Hafez School in Gaza City,
*  killed at least 12 people Tuesday.
*  We were sitting peacefully and we did not see the explosion.
*  The people are gone.
*  They're dead.
*  They are under the rubble.
*  Our people.
*  Our children.
*  We don't know where our young girls.
*  My dears, where are they?
*  Hundreds of people have taken shelter at the school.
*  Displaced Palestinians are yet again on the move after Israel issued fresh evacuation
*  orders for the densely packed Deir al-Bala.
*  It's not clear where they can take refuge since there is no safe place in Gaza.
*  In the southern city of Khan Yunis, a Palestinian man who spent over two months in Israel's
*  Ofir prison was released and reunited with his family.
*  Habardin Maqat recounted the horrors he and other Palestinian prisoners were subjected
*  to.
*  We stayed for about 40 to 50 days blindfolded with this cloth.
*  We were sitting down with our hands and feet bound.
*  What's happening in the prison, there's no living person of conscience who could bear
*  it.
*  The Palestinian Prisoners Society says detainees at Ofir prisons suffer quote, systematic torture
*  and humiliation, unquote.
*  This all comes as another ceasefire deal appears to have stalled.
*  Meanwhile, Gaza's health ministry said Tuesday it's still waiting to receive polio vaccines
*  amidst a growing risk of a major outbreak across Gaza.
*  Lebanon's health ministry said at least five people were killed Tuesday in Israeli strikes
*  on southern Lebanon.
*  At least one other death was reported today.
*  Hezbollah said it launched a barrage of rockets and drones at Israeli troops in response.
*  A new report by Oil Change International lays out the countries and companies that have
*  transferred the most fossil fuels to Israel since its launch, its war on Gaza, and says
*  they could be liable for complicity in war crimes and genocide under international law.
*  Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Gabon are three of the top countries supplying crude oil to
*  Israel.
*  Brazil ranks in fourth place, supplying nearly 10 percent of Israel's crude despite President
*  Luis Inácio Lula de Silva speaking out against the war.
*  US supplies, JPA jet fuel for Israel's warplanes, sourced from a Valero refinery in Texas.
*  Corporations including BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Total Energies, and Shell are also named as
*  main culprits.
*  The report holds up Colombia as an example for other nations after it halted coal exports
*  to Israel over the war.
*  In related news, the Scottish government announced it will stop holding meetings with
*  Israeli ambassadors until real progress is made towards a Gaza ceasefire.
*  Police arrested dozens of people Tuesday night outside the Israeli consulate in Chicago as
*  police clashed with demonstrators demanding an end to Israel's war on Gaza.
*  This is protester and Chicago resident Jonathan Bell.
*  They are starving the people.
*  They are bombing schools and hospitals.
*  And the people here are protesting to say that that's not right.
*  And the United States should not be aiding and abetting a terrorist like Netanyahu.
*  He is a terrorist.
*  And his cabinet, who are calling for the starvation and the annihilation of the Palestinian people,
*  it is a terrorist act on the part of Israel.
*  Elsewhere in the UK, five activists were handed prison sentences of between 12 and 16 months
*  Tuesday after occupying the Thales weapons factory in Glasgow, Scotland.
*  The group Palestine Action says 16 of their activists are in prison as a result of their
*  actions to stop the genocide in Gaza.
*  Russia says its air defenses shot down 11 Ukrainian drones in, quote, one of the largest
*  ever attempts to attack Moscow with drones, unquote.
*  This comes as Ukraine's surprise offensive in Russia's Kursk region continues.
*  Kyiv says hundreds of Russian soldiers have surrendered since the incursions started
*  two weeks ago.
*  Meanwhile, Russian missile and drone attacks hit energy infrastructure in northern Ukraine,
*  causing a large fire that released chlorine into the air from an industrial facility.
*  Arizona's Supreme Court ruled voters will be able to decide whether abortion rights
*  should be enshrined in Arizona's constitution in November's election.
*  The ruling defeats an attempt by the group Arizona Right to Life to block the ballot
*  measure.
*  Also Tuesday, Montana's secretary of state confirmed Montana's ballot will include an
*  initiative on abortion rights.
*  A total of eight states now have abortion rights on the November ballot.
*  A few others are still pending.
*  In other election news, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s running mate has suggested the pair
*  might end their independent bid for the White House and join forces with Donald Trump.
*  Nicole Shanahan made the comment in an interview on the podcast Impact Theory.
*  There's two options that we're looking at, and one is staying in, forming that new party,
*  but we run the risk of a Kamala Harris and Waltz presidency because we draw votes from
*  Trump or we draw somehow more votes from Trump, or we walk away right now and join forces
*  with Donald Trump.
*  And back here in Chicago, just a few miles from the Democratic National Convention, over
*  a thousand nurses from the University of Illinois Hospital are on a week-long strike.
*  The Illinois Nurses Association says UI Health has refused to address understaffing, unsafe
*  working conditions and fair pay demands.
*  Democras now spoke to nurses on the picket line Tuesday.
*  I'm Eileen Fajardo-Ferland.
*  I've been here at UIH since 2004, 20 years, and I also serve as the chair for the nursing
*  care committee.
*  We're striking because of unfair labor practice.
*  For the first time ever, the management team walked out during negotiation, walked out
*  and wouldn't come back when we asked them to come back.
*  But we do have other things that is on the table, one of which is our safety.
*  They have a workplace violence prevention committee.
*  There are 39 management people on the committee, not one single bedside nurse.
*  Disgraced New Jersey Democrat Senator Bob Menendez has resigned from the U.S. Senate
*  in the wake of his convictions for bribery, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign
*  agent for Egypt and Qatar.
*  The once-powerful head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to be sentenced
*  October 29th and faces up to 20 years in prison, though he says he's appealing his conviction.
*  New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy tapped George Samir Helmi to fill Menendez's seat until
*  the results of November's election are certified.
*  Helmi is Murphy's former chief of staff.
*  Democratic Congressmember Andy Kim is facing Republican hotelier Curtis Bashaw on the ballot.
*  Panama's government has begun the mass expulsion of undocumented immigrants on U.S.-funded
*  flights.
*  On Tuesday, Panamanian officials deported at least 29 Colombian migrants who had crossed
*  into Panama through the deadly Darien Gap.
*  Panamanian President José Raúl Molino has made blocking asylum seekers from crossing
*  the Darien jungle a central issue in his government.
*  In July, Panama unveiled a deal with the Biden administration to deport more migrants in
*  the region.
*  Migrant deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border have continued to surge due to extreme heat
*  and harsher border enforcement policies that have forced asylum seekers to cross through
*  more remote and dangerous regions.
*  In Arizona, officials warn this year is likely to set another dire record of migrant deaths
*  in the Sonoran Desert as humanitarian aid workers are repeatedly targeted by border
*  agents.
*  This is Pima County Medical Examiner Gregory Hess.
*  Last year in 2023, I think we recovered about 190-some total remains.
*  This year, we're basically on the same pace as we were last year.
*  We always get more remains in the summer.
*  So I think we've recovered about 105 remains so far this year, and probably half of those
*  have been in the last two months.
*  In New York City, dozens of migrants who'd been sleeping in a makeshift camp on Randall's
*  Island were forcibly removed by Police Monday as the city intensifies its crackdown on asylum
*  seekers.
*  Slam New York City Mayor Eric Adams' policies that have pushed hundreds of asylum seekers
*  out of shelters, forcing them to sleep on the streets.
*  On Tuesday, state officials proved the eviction of about 30,000 migrant parents and children
*  staying in city facilities.
*  The Legal Aid Society said, quote, treating people who have come here seeking asylum and
*  safety like they are threats is incomprehensible in what's supposed to be a sanctuary city.
*  To see Democracy Now's extended discussion on the Democratic Party and the issue of immigration,
*  we've expended to two hours all week during the Democratic National Convention.
*  Check out our other hour at democracynow.org.
*  A new report by Human Rights Watch has accused the city of Los Angeles of implementing a
*  quote, cruel, expensive and ineffective policy of criminalizing unhoused people.
*  The report says Los Angeles' systematic sweeps on the dwellings of unhoused people only serves
*  to remove them from public view and focuses on punishment and quick fixes rather than
*  addressing the dire housing and care needs they face.
*  This is Michelle, one of the unhoused people featured in Human Rights Watch's video accompanying
*  their report.
*  They took our food.
*  They took all my underclothes.
*  They took all my shoes.
*  They leave us with no resources.
*  So we're stuck here until we can manage to get something to eat or clean water or whatever
*  it is because they don't care.
*  As a result of L.A. policies, death rates of unhoused people have skyrocketed with an
*  average of more than six unhoused people dying in Los Angeles County every day.
*  A black person is six times more likely to be unhoused in L.A. than a white person.
*  The situation is likely to get even worse as California Governor Gavin Newsom recently
*  ordered local authorities to remove encampments following a Supreme Court ruling which criminalized
*  sleeping in public places.
*  In Bosnia, three educators were killed in the western town of Sonski most earlier today
*  when a gunman with an assault rifle opened fire in a high school.
*  The United States has imposed sanctions on former Haitian President Michel Martelly for
*  drug trafficking and money laundering.
*  A U.S. official said the sanctions against Martelly underscored the quote destabilizing
*  role he and other corrupt political elites have played in perpetuating the ongoing crisis
*  in Haiti, unquote.
*  Martelly was Haiti's president from 2011 to 2016.
*  This comes as the U.N.-backed Kenyan-led police force deployed to Haiti almost two
*  months ago appears to have made little inroads in addressing the spiraling insecurity and
*  gang activity in Haiti.
*  In Ohio, a judge denied a request by residents of East Palestine to have more time and information
*  before a deadline tomorrow to accept a $600 million class action settlement with Norfolk
*  Southern over last year's train derailment.
*  Residents near the site of the disaster can also claim up to $25,000 per person for personal
*  injuries as part of the deal, but accepting the money means they will give up their right
*  to sue in the future if residents develop cancer or other serious illnesses due to chemical
*  exposure.
*  Earlier this month, the Associated Press revealed cleanup workers in East Palestine became sick
*  with headaches and nausea, but their health conditions were kept hidden from the public.
*  And other environmental news students at two Maryland schools in Harford County have
*  been told to avoid drinking school water over concerns about levels of chemicals known as
*  PFAS.
*  The widely used substances are referred to as forever chemicals and have been linked
*  to a host of health conditions.
*  PFAS are present in many foods, common household materials, and waterways.
*  And in related news, the U.S. Air Force has refused to comply with an EPA cleanup order
*  after the Air Force polluted drinking water sources in Tucson, Arizona, including with
*  PFAS.
*  The Air Force cited the Supreme Court's ruling overturning the four decades old Chevron
*  Doctrine earlier this year.
*  In May, the court's far-right majority stripped federal agencies of the authority to enforce
*  its interpretation of a law leaving judges with broad latitude to determine how environmental
*  laws are enforced.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org.
*  For Peace in the Presidency, we are breaking with convention.
*  I'm Amy Goodman here with Juan González.
*  We're broadcasting from the studios of Cannes TV here in Chicago.
*  Hi Juan.
*  Hi Amy and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around
*  the world.
