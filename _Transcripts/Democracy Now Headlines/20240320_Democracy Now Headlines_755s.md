# Top U.S. & World Headlines — March 20, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPgsac6XCsI)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In a surprise ruling, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has blocked Texas from enforcing
*  a harsh new anti-immigrant law that gives local police sweeping powers to arrest and
*  deport anyone they suspect has entered the United States without authorization.
*  The appeals court ruling came just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the law could
*  go into effect while the case is being heard by lower courts.
*  Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed SB 4 into law in December, but the law was challenged
*  by the Biden administration.
*  Oral arguments before the appeals court will be held today.
*  On Tuesday, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized the Texas law, writing in her dissent,
*  quote,
*  This law will disrupt sensitive foreign relations, frustrate the protection of individuals fleeing
*  persecution, hamper active federal enforcement efforts, undermine federal agencies' ability
*  to detect and monitor imminent security threats, and deter non-citizens from reporting abuse
*  or trafficking, Sotomayor said.
*  Authorities in Mexico have also condemned the Texas law.
*  a number of deadly strikes in Gaza over the past 24 hours.
*  In Gaza City, an Israeli attack killed 24 people at the Kuwaiti roundabout, where Palestinians
*  had gathered to collect aid.
*  Meanwhile, an Israeli attack on the Nusrat refugee camp has killed at least 27 Palestinians.
*  The official death toll in Gaza is approaching 32,000.
*  The World Health Organization warned Tuesday many infants in Gaza are on the, quote,
*  brink of death due to the lack of food.
*  A WHO spokesperson said newborn babies are, quote,
*  simply dying because of low birth weight.
*  The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, said Israel may be committing
*  war crimes by limiting aid into Gaza.
*  The extent of Israel's continued restrictions on the entry of aid into Gaza, together with
*  the manner in which it continues to conduct hostilities, may amount to the use of starvation
*  as a method of war, which is a war crime.
*  The clock is ticking.
*  Everyone, especially those with influence, must insist that Israel acts to facilitate
*  the unimpeded entry and distribution of needed humanitarian assistance to end starvation
*  and avert all risk of famine.
*  Israeli forces are continuing the deadly raid on Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.
*  Al Jazeera reports dozens of people have been killed.
*  Hundreds of Palestinians have also been detained, including another Al Jazeera journalist, Mahmoud
*  who was reporting inside the hospital complex.
*  His colleague, Ismail Arul, was detained Monday, stripped naked, held for many hours, released
*  and beaten.
*  The World Health Organization says it's documented 410 attacks on healthcare facilities
*  in Gaza since Israel began its assault on October 7th.
*  In other news on Gaza, Canada's government has announced it will halt weapons shipments
*  to Israel after the Canadian Parliament approved a non-binding resolution on the issue.
*  The motion, which passed by a vote of 204 to 117, also called on Canada to work towards
*  the establishment of the state of Palestine.
*  In the United States, voters headed to the polls Tuesday for primaries in Arizona, Florida,
*  Illinois, Kansas and Ohio.
*  Bernie Moreno won the Republican Senate primary, defeating State Senator Matt Dolan and Ohio
*  Secretary of State Frank LaRose.
*  Moreno is a wealthy former card dealer, backed by Donald Trump and Senator J.D. Vance.
*  Moreno will now face Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown in November in a race that could decide
*  which party controls the U.S. Senate.
*  Joe Biden and Donald Trump won all their races Tuesday, but there continue to be signs that
*  many voters are not happy with their party's presumptive nominees.
*  In Arizona, over 18 percent of Republicans chose Nikki Haley over Trump, even though
*  she's already suspended her campaign.
*  Meanwhile, in Kansas, more than 10 percent of Democrats selected none of the names shown
*  instead of Biden.
*  In Illinois, some Democrats, including Ibrahim Rashid, said they stayed home instead of voting
*  for Biden.
*  I actually canvassed for Biden in 2020.
*  I was really involved with the South Asians for Biden movement, bringing out South Asian
*  young Muslims and others to come out to vote for Biden in 2020.
*  And I'm planning on sitting out the election, because I am just horrified at Biden's stance
*  on Israel-Palestine.
*  I'm of the view that, you know, we delivered Biden his majority, and he is failing us as
*  young progressive voters.
*  So right now I'm going to say no ceasefire, no votes.
*  In more campaign news, Donald Trump is facing widespread criticism over comments he made
*  about Jewish Democratic voters.
*  A Jewish person that votes for Democrats hates their religion, they hate everything about
*  Israel and they should be ashamed of themselves.
*  On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer blasted Trump's remark as, quote,
*  Trump made the comment on a podcast hosted by former White House aide Sebastian Gorka,
*  who has faced accusations of anti-Semitism as well.
*  In 2017, the Jewish newspaper The Forward reported Gorka had ties to a Hungarian far-right
*  Nazi allied group and that he supported an anti-Semitic and racist paramilitary militia
*  in Hungary while he served as a Hungarian politician.
*  Trump's son-in-law and former adviser Jared Kushner has weighed in on Israel's war on
*  Gaza, saying Israel should move Palestinians out of the besieged territory, which he said
*  contains very valuable waterfront property.
*  Kushner made the remarks during a recent event hosted by the Middle East Initiative at Harvard
*  Kennedy School.
*  In Gaza's waterfront property, it could be very valuable to—if people would focus
*  on kind of building up, you know, livelihoods.
*  You think about all the money that's gone into this tunnel network and into all the
*  munitions, if that would have gone into education or innovation, what could have been done?
*  And so, I think that it's a little bit of an unfortunate situation there, but I think
*  from Israel's perspective, I would do my best to move the people out and then clean
*  it up.
*  But I don't think that Israel has stated that they don't want the people to move
*  back there afterwards.
*  The humanitarian aid group, Medicine Sans Plantieres, Doctors Without Borders, has accused Libya's
*  Coast Guard of thwarting the rescue of over 170 migrants, most of them Syrian refugees,
*  from two vessels stranded in the Mediterranean Sea as they made their way to Europe.
*  MSF said a Libyan Coast Guard ship had started to perform dangerous maneuvers, blocking two
*  rigid inflatable boats used by MSF to rescue the migrants.
*  The Libyan Coast Guard, which is funded by the European Union, also reportedly attempted
*  one of MSF's inflatable boats.
*  A number of those on board the migrant vessels were unaccompanied children and children under
*  the age of 13.
*  Just last week, at least 60 people are believed to have drowned in the Mediterranean after
*  departing Libya on a migrant vessel.
*  According to the International Organization for Migration, 2,500 migrants died or went
*  missing in the Mediterranean last year as they attempted to reach Europe.
*  Two hundred deaths have been recorded since the beginning of the year.
*  The Cuban government is accusing the United States of inciting recent protests in Cuba,
*  where a growing economic crisis has resulted in power blackouts and food shortages.
*  On Sunday, hundreds of people took to the streets of Santiago, Cuba's second largest
*  city.
*  Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel criticized U.S. policy in an interview with NBC News
*  in Havana.
*  They are always looking for justifications and turning things around.
*  The most absurd thing is that they have applied a criminal blockade against us for more than
*  65 years.
*  That is the absurdity.
*  And the absurdity of that blockade is what has provoked all other reactions, which is
*  reflected in the things that are happening.
*  The U.N. Weather Agency has issued a red alert about the climate emergency, as new data from
*  the World Meteorological Organization shows last year was by far the warmest year on record,
*  and that this year may be even hotter.
*  Celia Salo, the secretary general of the WMO, spoke on Tuesday.
*  The year 2023 set new records for every single climate indicator.
*  This annual report shows that the climate crisis is the defining challenge that humanity
*  faces.
*  It is closely intertwined with inequality crisis, as witnessed by growing food insecurity,
*  population displacement and biodiversity loss.
*  In Jackson, Mississippi, two white former sheriff deputies, who belonged to a group
*  that described itself as the Goon Squad, were sentenced to lengthy prison time for raiding
*  a home and torturing two black men in January of 2023.
*  Hunter Elward received a 20-year prison sentence.
*  Jeffrey Middleton was sentenced to 17 and a half years.
*  Both pleaded guilty to multiple felony federal and state charges last August, along with
*  four other former law enforcement officers.
*  The six men burst into a home, then beat, handcuffed, waterboarded and tasered Michael
*  Corey Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker.
*  The officers also sexually abused them with a sex toy while shouting racial slurs.
*  One of the officers put a gun in Jenkins' mouth for a mock execution and pulled the
*  trigger.
*  The bullet lacerated Jenkins' tongue, broke his jaw and exited through his neck.
*  The officers then planted drugs at the scene in an attempt to cover up their act.
*  One of the officers, Hunter Elward, was also sentenced for his role in a separate assault
*  just two weeks earlier, when another member of the Goon Squad repeatedly tased a man and
*  pressed his genitals into the man's mouth.
*  And in a speech on the Arizona State Senate floor Tuesday, Democrat Eva Birch shared she
*  plans to obtain an abortion after receiving news her pregnancy is nonviable.
*  The first-term lawmaker spoke about her struggles with fertility and a miscarriage she had over
*  a decade ago.
*  Two years ago, while I was campaigning for this Senate seat, I became pregnant with what
*  we later determined was a nonviable pregnancy.
*  It was a pregnancy that we had been trying for and we were heartbroken over it.
*  But now, I wish I could tell you otherwise, but after numerous ultrasounds and blood draws,
*  we have determined that my pregnancy is once again not progressing and is not viable.
*  And once again, I have scheduled an appointment to terminate my pregnancy.
*  I don't think people should have to justify their abortions, but I'm choosing to talk
*  why I made this decision, because I want us to be able to have meaningful conversations
*  about the reality of how the work that we do in this body impacts people in the real
*  world.
*  Arizona State Senator Eva Birch is a former nurse practitioner who worked at a women's
*  health clinic and has been widely critical of abortion restrictions in Arizona, where
*  abortions are banned after 15 weeks of pregnancy.
*  There are no exceptions for rape or incest.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
