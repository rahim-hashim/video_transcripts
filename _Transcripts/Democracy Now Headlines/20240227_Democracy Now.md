*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman as the official Palestinian death toll, and Israel's war on Gaza nears
*  30,000.
*  President Biden said Monday he hopes a ceasefire can be achieved by next Monday.
*  Well, I hope by the end of the weekend.
*  I mean, the end of the weekend.
*  At least, my national security adviser tells me that we're close.
*  We're close.
*  It's not done yet.
*  And my hope is by next Monday we'll have a ceasefire.
*  President Biden made the comment in a New York City ice cream shop with late night host
*  Seth Meyers, whose show he appeared on Monday evening.
*  Cutter, which is hosting negotiations, said it's optimistic a deal could be reached
*  before Ramadan next month.
*  Meanwhile, Reuters reports Hamas called Biden's remarks premature.
*  Meanwhile, on the ground in Gaza, Israeli forces opened fire again on people waiting
*  for aid in Gaza City.
*  A Palestinian man who was waiting for a delivery of flour pleaded with the world to take mercy
*  on hungry Palestinians.
*  Look at us through the eyes of mercy, people.
*  For the sake of Islam, look with mercy.
*  Film so the people can see the starvation, how people are coming.
*  They're carrying the martyrs on a donkey cart, on a bicycle.
*  We don't have any value anymore.
*  We don't have any value.
*  No one is looking at us.
*  On Monday, Jordan and France conducted a joint operation to airdrop food to central and
*  southern Gaza.
*  Palestinians used rowboats to retrieve aid packages dropped at sea.
*  Gazans continue to face starvation, affecting even its youngest babies, who do not have
*  access to milk or formula.
*  My son is supposed to have milk as a newborn, be it natural milk or formula milk, but I
*  wasn't able to get him milk because there is no milk in Gaza.
*  I had to give him a date because I can't provide milk for him because there is no food.
*  There is no fruits.
*  As a mother who just gave birth, there is no fruits or vegetables.
*  There is nothing in Gaza.
*  In other news from Gaza, acclaimed artist Fatih Rabin has died after Israeli authorities
*  denied him permission to travel for medical treatment.
*  The 77-year-old artist, suffered from severe chest and lung conditions, was unable to get
*  care in Gaza due to the lack of oxygen and other crucial health resources in the besieged
*  territory.
*  His paintings immortalized the Palestinian struggle and the right of return.
*  The International Court of Justice Monday concluded its six-day hearing on Israel's
*  occupation of Palestinian territories.
*  Representatives from over 50 nations and international organizations presented oral
*  statements at the Hague, most arguing Israel's military occupation of the West Bank, Gaza
*  and East Jerusalem as a violation of international law and calling for the establishment of an
*  independent Palestinian state.
*  This is Abdelhakim Erafai with the League of Arab States.
*  This prolonged occupation is an affront to international justice.
*  The failure to bring it to an end has led to the current horrors perpetrated against
*  the Palestinian people, amounting to genocide.
*  There can be no moral or juridical justification for occupying lands, killing, terrorizing
*  and displacing their populations.
*  In related news, human rights groups say Israel has completely ignored the World Court's
*  order to take all measures within its power to prevent genocide in Gaza.
*  One month after the ruling, Israel has continued to block most delivery of lifesaving humanitarian
*  aid, food, medicines and fuel to Gaza.
*  Since January's ruling, Israeli forces have killed over 3,400 Palestinians in Gaza.
*  The Israeli government is expected to soon deliver its own 30-day assessment of compliance
*  with the ICJ decision.
*  In response, Omar Shakir with Human Rights Watch said, quote, Israel's blatant disregard
*  for the World Court's order poses a direct challenge to the rules-based international
*  order.
*  Failure to ensure Israel's compliance puts the lives of millions of Palestinians at risk
*  and threatens to undermine the institution's charge with ensuring respect for international
*  law and the system that ensures civilian protection worldwide, he said.
*  Washington, D.C. and elsewhere Monday for Aaron Bushnell, an active duty U.S. Air Force
*  member who died after setting himself on fire outside the Israeli embassy in Washington
*  to protest genocide in Gaza.

*  by the flames.
*  Marion Ingram, an 88-year-old artist, activist and German Holocaust survivor, was at the
*  D.C. vigil on Monday.
*  She was carrying a sign that said, Survivor Says Peace, Not Wars, in our Name.
*  You can see our interviews with Marion Ingram at democracynow.org.
*  In response to Aaron Bushnell's active protest, Palestinian poet and journalist Mohammed
*  Khil Kurd said, quote, If you're a soldier sacrificing yourself to protect U.S. interests,
*  you're a rational, noble hero.
*  But if you sacrifice yourself to protest the genocide your country is funding, you are
*  mentally ill, unquote.
*  Meanwhile, Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder dodged a reporter question about how military
*  members feel about the U.S. role in Gaza.
*  But is the secretary concerned that this might indicate that there's a deeper issue, maybe
*  U.S. military personnel being concerned about how weapons and support for Israel is being
*  used on civilians in Gaza?
*  Well, look, from a Department of Defense standpoint, since Hamas' brutal attacks on October 7th,
*  we've been focused on the four key areas that the secretary set out from the onset.
*  That's protecting U.S. forces and citizens in the region, supporting Israel's inherent
*  right to defend itself from terrorist attacks, working closely with Israel to support and
*  secure the release of hostages from Hamas.
*  In New York, hundreds of Jewish American activists and allies descended on 30 Rockefeller Center,
*  headquarters of NBC, to disrupt President Biden's surprise appearance on Late Night
*  with Seth Meyers.
*  Around 50 activists were arrested, according to organizers.
*  Elsewhere, the faculty at the University of Illinois Chicago overwhelmingly voted to
*  call for a ceasefire in Gaza in a referendum last week.
*  Outside the U.S.'s Ireland Senate, outside of the United States, Ireland's Senate unanimously
*  voted last week to impose sanctions against Israel, prevent the passage of U.S. weapons
*  to Israel via Irish airspace and advocate for an international arms embargo against Israel.
*  This is Irish Senator Frances Black, who helped put forward the motion.
*  When I visited Gaza back in 2018 and the amazing people I met there and the spirit of the people
*  and how amazing and I don't know if they're dead, I don't know if they're alive.
*  I remember one woman saying to me when I was in Gaza back then, she said that she was a
*  human rights, a human rights organization, a wonderful women's group, and she said,
*  why have the international community abandoned us?
*  And those words staid to me.
*  Israeli airstrikes in eastern Lebanon Monday killed at least two people believed to be
*  members of Hezbollah.
*  Israel's attacks on Baalbek came after Hezbollah confirmed it has shot down an Israeli drone
*  in southern Lebanon.
*  Later on Monday, Hezbollah said it fired dozens of rockets at an Israeli military base in
*  retaliation.
*  Elsewhere, U.S. forces said it carried out preemptive strikes against Houthi targets
*  in Yemen, destroying missiles, unmanned vessels and a drone.
*  In election news, voters in the battleground state of Michigan are casting their primary
*  ballots today.
*  The group Listen to Michigan has been urging Democrats to vote uncommitted to show their
*  opposition to President Biden's refusal to stop Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who's been campaigning for Biden,
*  predicted during an interview Monday, quote, there will be a sizable number of votes for
*  uncommitted, unquote.
*  Members of the 300,000-strong Arab American community in Michigan and others gathered
*  on Sunday ahead of the vote.
*  We need to show President Biden and all the other candidates that we support Palestine.
*  We don't support our U.S. tax dollars going towards Israel to ethnically cleanse Palestine,
*  and this is a human cause, and so we're all showing up.
*  Activists in Minnesota recently launched their own uncommitted campaign ahead of
*  Minnesota's presidential primary, March 5th.
*  A close associate of Alexei Navalny says the late Russian opposition leader was days away
*  from being released in a prisoner exchange.
*  Maria Pepchik, chair of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, spoke on Alexei Navalny's YouTube
*  channel.
*  — Navalny was everything Putin could never be, and Putin hated him for it.
*  But why did he kill him now?
*  Why February 16th?
*  — Alexei Navalny could have been sitting in my place right now, today.
*  This is not a figure of speech.
*  This could have and should have happened.
*  Navalny was supposed to be free in the coming days, because we had achieved a decision on
*  his exchange.
*  — Maria Pepchik accused President Putin of killing Navalny to prevent the swap from
*  happening.
*  Navalny was allegedly to be exchanged, along with two unnamed U.S. nationals, for Vadim
*  Krasikov, a Russian secret service member who's serving a life sentence in Germany
*  for the 2019 murder of a Georgian-born Chechen dissident.
*  Media outlets speculate that two American citizens could be Wall Street Journal reporter
*  Evan Gershkovich and former Marine Paul Whelan.
*  Denmark's closed its investigation into the 2022 blast on the Nord Stream pipelines,
*  which were built to carry natural gas from Russia to Europe.
*  Danish authorities concluded there was deliberate sabotage of the pipelines but insufficient
*  evidence to pursue the case.
*  Sweden dropped its own probe into the matter earlier this month.
*  Moscow's blamed the U.S., the U.K. and Ukraine for the explosions.
*  French President Emmanuel Macron is leading a European effort to send more arms to Ukraine.
*  These will include more middle and long-range missiles.
*  Macron also did not rule out eventually sending French or other Western troops to Ukraine.
*  He spoke Monday at a Paris conference of 20 European leaders.
*  Everything was discussed in a free and direct manner tonight.
*  There was no consensus today to send troops onto the ground in a manner that's official,
*  assumed and endorsed.
*  But on the dynamic, nothing should be excluded.
*  We will do everything so that Russia cannot win this war.
*  Sweden's cleared its final obstacle to join NATO.
*  After Hungary's parliament ratified Stockholm's bid Monday, the Swedish prime minister hailed
*  the historic step.
*  Sweden is leaving behind 200 years of neutrality and military nonalignment.
*  As far as Russia is concerned, the only thing we can safely expect is that they do not like
*  Sweden becoming a NATO member.
*  They didn't like Finland becoming a NATO member either.
*  The whole purpose was to emphasize that a country like Ukraine would not be allowed
*  to choose its own path.
*  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban had blocked Sweden's bid for membership for
*  over 18 months, but finally relented following last week's deal for Sweden to sell Hungary
*  four fighter jets.
*  In Burkina Faso, dozens of people were killed after an attack Sunday on a mosque in Natiobuani

*  during Sunday mass in northern Burkina Faso.
*  And back here in New York, a former professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine
*  in the Bronx has donated a billion dollars to make tuition free for Albert Einstein medical
*  students.
*  Ruth Gottesman's donation is one of the largest ever made to an educational institution
*  in the U.S.
*  The 93-year-old, who studied learning disabilities and created an adult literacy program, was
*  married to a Wall Street financier who left her the money when he died in 2022.
*  She made the announcement to a crowd of students who erupted in cheers.
*  Dr. Oni Blackstock, physician and founder of Health Justice, who was a professor at
*  Albert Einstein, said on social media, quote,
*  "...hoping there's positive impact on the health of Bronxites, home to the poorest congressional
*  district in the U.S.
*  I also hope this helps to recruit more black, Latinx and indigenous students, groups that
*  are woefully underrepresented in medicine and that do not have the same level of generational
*  wealth as their white counterparts," she said.
*  Ruth Gottesman insisted a condition of the gift was not to rename the school in her name,
*  telling The New York Times, quote,
*  "...we've got the gosh darn name.
*  We've got Albert Einstein."
*  And those are some of the headlines.
