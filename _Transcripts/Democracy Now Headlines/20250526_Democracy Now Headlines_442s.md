As part of our Memorial Day special, we speak with death row inmate Keith LaMar live from the Ohio State Penitentiary about The Injustice of Justice, a short film about his case that recently won the grand prize for best animated short film at the Golden State Film Festival. “I had to find out the hard way that in order for my life to be mine, that I had to stand up and claim it,” says LaMar, who has always maintained his innocence. LaMar was sentenced to death for participating in the murder of five fellow prisoners during a 1993 prison uprising. His trial was held in a remote Ohio community before an all-white jury. On January 13, 2027, the state intends to execute him, after subjecting him to three decades in solitary confinement. LaMar’s lawyer, Keegan Stephan, says his legal team has “discovered a lot of new evidence supporting Keith’s innocence” that should necessitate new legal avenues for LaMar to overturn the conviction.

*  Thousands of people around the country and the world have rallied around my cause, joining [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  me in my demand for justice. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  Here's my story. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=70.4s)]
*  When I was 19 years old and selling drugs, a group of would-be robbers in search of money [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=72.52s)]
*  forced their way into my apartment, a shootout ensued. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=79.28s)]
*  And regrettably, I took someone's life and was myself shot twice in the legs. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  Facing a long prison sentence and on the advice of counsel, I pled guilty to murder and was [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=88.64s)]
*  sentenced to serve 18 years to life. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=94.68s)]
*  Determined to redeem myself and make good on my potential, I completed my GED, enrolled [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=98.0s)]
*  in college and became a voracious reader in an attempt to repair myself to society. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=104.58s)]
*  I was in the fourth year of my sentence when, in 1993, a riot erupted inside the prison. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=111.34s)]
*  Apparently, a group of Muslim prisoners on religious grounds refused to submit to mandatory [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=118.9s)]
*  tuberculosis testing and were given an automaton, take the test or else. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=125.86s)]
*  Amid rumors of a forced inoculation, the Muslims took over the prison in protest, releasing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=131.9s)]
*  some 400 prisoners from their cells and setting into motion an 11-day standoff that would [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=138.58s)]
*  ultimately claim the lives of one guard and nine prisoners. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=144.38s)]
*  I was on the recreation yard when it all began. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=149.10000000000002s)]
*  A guard came running out of the building with blood streaming down his face, followed by [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=152.34s)]
*  a masked prisoner who was carrying a weapon and yelling. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  He'd taken over. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=161.34s)]
*  Against my better judgment, I went inside to check on my personal belongings. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=163.70000000000002s)]
*  A fatal mistake. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=168.22s)]
*  It was complete chaos. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=169.94s)]
*  When I made it to my assigned location, I discovered that it was being used as a holding [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=171.7s)]
*  area for hostages, both guards and prisoners. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=177.54s)]
*  I was there after approached by a masked prisoner who gave me the option to either participate [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=181.54s)]
*  or leave. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=186.34s)]
*  I chose to leave. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=188.54s)]
*  Hundreds of us gathered on the yard, waiting as the National Guard and Highway Patrol took [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=191.54s)]
*  up watch outside the perimeter fence. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=197.73999999999998s)]
*  Later, when dead bodies were dumped into the yard, they stood by and did nothing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=200.94s)]
*  It was as if I was trapped inside a nightmare. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=206.73999999999998s)]
*  Around 2 a.m. the following morning, we were rounded up and herded into the gymnasium where [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=210.54s)]
*  we were stripped naked and then violently forced in random groups of 10 into cells [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=216.34s)]
*  meant for one person. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=222.29999999999998s)]
*  Stressed and stretched to the limit, a fight broke out over food. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=225.85999999999999s)]
*  Tragically, I stood back and watched as a man named Dennis Weaver was held down by three [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=230.26s)]
*  prisoners and choked to death. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  It was a cowardly thing to do, and I can now see and admit that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  But at the time, I was worried about my own life. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=241.94s)]
*  When I was later questioned by authorities, I claimed to have been asleep. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=245.94s)]
*  It was my way of telling them that I didn't want to be involved. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=249.74s)]
*  But it was too late. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=253.74s)]
*  Because I had gone into the hostage area without wearing a mask, my name would be mentioned [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=256.18s)]
*  among a vast array of potential suspects. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=261.1s)]
*  Even though the state conceded that I was never affiliated with any of the gangs said [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=264.26s)]
*  to have presided over the ride. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=268.82s)]
*  The fact that I was already serving time for murder would play a big part in their decision [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=270.7s)]
*  to indict me. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=275.21999999999997s)]
*  Ultimately, I was charged with nine counts of aggravated murder. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=276.7s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=280.82s)]
*  Mind you, it was never expected that I would actually demand a trial. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=283.62s)]
*  He copped out once, he'll cop out again was the prevailing belief. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=287.3s)]
*  In fact, no sooner than I was indicted, I was offered a deal. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=292.42s)]
*  Plead guilty and we'll run the time concurrent with the time you're already serving. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=296.38s)]
*  In other words, I would have gotten off easier had I actually killed someone. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=301.54s)]
*  But why me? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=307.34000000000003s)]
*  Why was I singled out for this undeserved retribution? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=309.14s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=313.18s)]
*  One that I've spent the better part of three decades trying to explain. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=314.82s)]
*  Here's what I can tell you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=319.5s)]
*  When the riot came to an end, Orozella's officials rushed into the prison without first securing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  the massive crime scene, rendering inadmissible some 22,000 pieces of evidence. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=327.58s)]
*  So there was absolutely no evidence to link anyone to crimes. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=334.42s)]
*  This meant the state had to rely solely on the uncorrelated testimony of jailhouse informants, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=338.58s)]
*  the most unreliable witnesses of all. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=344.7s)]
*  What to do? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=348.82s)]
*  Well, the first thing the state did was enlist the help and expertise of the Hamilton County [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=349.9s)]
*  Prosecutors Office. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=355.54s)]
*  This was not a random selection. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=357.3s)]
*  Hamilton County has the dubious distinction of convicting and executing more than half [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=359.5s)]
*  of all death row prisoners in the United States. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=364.86s)]
*  And how have they been so successful? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=368.82s)]
*  The answer is simple and deadly. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=371.3s)]
*  Through the impaneling of all white juries, the use of paid jailhouse informants, and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=374.42s)]
*  the intentional withholding of exculpatory evidence, I have now in my possession the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=381.06s)]
*  statement of an actual perpetrator who admitted to murdering someone for whom I was sentenced [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=386.1s)]
*  to death. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=390.86s)]
*  And this is only the tip of the iceberg. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=391.86s)]
*  They withheld so much more. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=394.38s)]
*  It's over three decades later now, and I'm still in solitary confinement, being tortured [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=397.98s)]
*  because I refused to plead guilty to something I didn't do. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=404.34s)]
*  I'm innocent. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=408.9s)]
*  Look, we kid ourselves when we speak of justice. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=410.29999999999995s)]
*  Until we have a process that holds everyone equally accountable for their actions, this [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=415.5s)]
*  system will remain what it has always been, a punishment system. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=420.21999999999997s)]
*  And as we all know, those who don't have the capital get the punishment. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABy5XM6sbaw&t=426.5s)]
