President Trump has signed a number of anti-trans executive orders in the first month of his second term. He has attempted to ban trans women from sports, declared that there are only two sexes, and placed restrictions on gender-affirming care for trans youth. Trump continues to target trans people with hateful rhetoric, leaving trans people uncertain of their futures. “The Trump administration has declared war on trans people,” Imara Jones, founder and CEO of TransLash Media and host of its investigative podcast, The Anti-Trans Hate Machine, tells Democracy Now!

*  and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=66.28s)]
*  This is a big lie. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=71.48s)]
*  For more on President Trump's attacks on the trans community, we're joined now by [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=73.94s)]
*  Amara Jones, the founder and CEO of Translash Media, host of its investigative podcast, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=77.6s)]
*  The Anti-Trans Hate Machine. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=82.64s)]
*  Your response to last night's address, Amara? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=84.84s)]
*  I mean, I think that what trans people are feeling after last night's address and overall [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=87.44s)]
*  is that essentially the Trump administration has declared war on trans people and declared [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  war on trans existence. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=99.4s)]
*  And the fact that there was so much time and energy devoted to it last night, I think, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=101.16s)]
*  underscores the way that this community is targeting trans people as a part of its broader [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=105.6s)]
*  bid to undermine democracy and to usher in authoritarianism. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=112.56s)]
*  And Amara, I wanted to ask you about the Republican campaign's anti-trans ad blitz. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=118.04s)]
*  Earlier this month, CBS News reported that Trump's campaign spent more than 19 million [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=125.2s)]
*  dollars on two television ads that have aired nearly 55000 times since October 1. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  And they focus explicitly on transgender rights. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=138.24s)]
*  Yes, essentially, you know, the Trump campaign spent in total 215 million dollars on those [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=143.48s)]
*  ads, and it was the single largest ad buy of the Trump campaign. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=152.32s)]
*  So from the perspective of the Trump campaign, it was an anti-trans campaign. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=156.92s)]
*  And we know that it works. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=161.72s)]
*  I mean, they credit those ads with giving them the margin of victory to amongst young [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=163.04s)]
*  men between the ages of 18 and 35 who are oftentimes unreliable voters, which is one [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=170.92s)]
*  of the reasons why they weren't in the models that we were seeing in terms of projecting [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  the final numbers. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, the Trump campaign was seeing movement amongst that group and they showed up and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=184.2s)]
*  they showed up in part because of this targeted anti-trans campaign. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, Amara Jones, I want to thank you for being with us as we quickly span the scope [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=195.0s)]
*  of President Trump's address. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=199.56s)]
*  Amara Jones is the founder and CEO of Translash Media, host of its investigative podcast, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=201.68s)]
*  The Anti-Trans Hate Machine. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnlyeXn7xcI&t=206.28s)]
