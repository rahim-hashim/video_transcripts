Columbia University activist and student Mohsen Mahdawi graduated on Monday — after he was released from ICE jail late last month. As he crossed the stage, students erupted in thunderous applause. Democracy Now! spoke with Mahdawi after the ceremony. "I am coming here to be in the middle of this fire because I am a peacemaker, because I am a firefighter," says Mahdawi, who plans to attend Columbia University's graduate School of International and Public Affairs in the fall.

*  In mid-April, he was arrested in Vermont when he appeared for what he'd been told [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=54.68s)]
*  was his naturalization interview. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=61.28s)]

*  Mohsen moved to Vermont from the occupied West Bank in 2014, where he lived in El Farah, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=73.03999999999999s)]

*  Mohsen is one of several students who have been detained by the Trump administration. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=91.39999999999999s)]

*  Mohsen Madhawi spent two weeks in a Vermont prison before a federal judge in Vermont ordered [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=103.72s)]
*  him released on bail. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  The judge, Jeffrey Crawford, compared the recent detentions of immigrant student protesters [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=109.56s)]
*  to the Red Scare and the Palmer Raids. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=113.84s)]
*  Crawford ruled Madhawi should stay in Vermont but could come to New York for educational [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=116.16s)]
*  purposes. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  When the government objected to him crossing Vermont lines to come to New York, the judge [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  responded Mohsen Madhawi could travel to New York to attend his graduation at Columbia. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=126.16s)]
*  The judge went on to write, quote, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=131.32s)]
*  During his time in New York State, Mr. Madhawi is permitted to move freely, conduct his daily [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=133.04s)]
*  activities normally, including but not limited to meeting with elected officials, speaking [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=138.07999999999998s)]

*  attending protests, the judge wrote. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  On Friday, Mohsen appeared in our Democracy Now! studio for his first live interview since [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  being released from prison. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=157.72s)]
*  Well on Monday, I met up with Mohsen again and spoke to him just after he graduated. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=159.68s)]
*  I am very happy that I am able to come to this university all the way from a refugee [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=189.68s)]
*  camp, to survive the war, to be able to continue holding on hope, to climb the wall, the 30-foot [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=196.68s)]
*  wall on a constructed ladder and come down by a rope, to make it to America in order [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=203.68s)]
*  to be able to fulfill my uncle's dream, which is education is hope and education is life. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=210.68s)]
*  So there is joy in that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=218.68s)]
*  There is sadness that my uncle is not here to witness this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=220.68s)]
*  And there is sadness that my family, my parents, could not leave the West Bank and come and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=226.68s)]
*  see this moment. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=230.68s)]
*  And there is sadness that there are no universities left in Gaza where students can experience [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=231.68s)]
*  such a joy, where hope can be harnessed in universities. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=238.68s)]
*  And there is joy that also the Trump administration and this unjust government that tried to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=244.68s)]
*  keep me in prison. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=250.68s)]
*  I am on university campus, not in prison. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=252.68s)]
*  I am in my graduation clothes, not in my prison clothes. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=255.68s)]
*  And I am celebrating here around the buffet, not having the 20-minute pre-bird meal in [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=259.68s)]
*  the prison. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=265.68s)]
*  So if this is something, this is the hope that I give, the life that I give to the American [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=266.68s)]
*  people, to the good American people who have supported me, to the Vermonters, to the people [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=272.68s)]
*  who fought for justice. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=277.68s)]
*  It's a hope that democracy is functioning. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=279.68s)]
*  The justice system that gave me the order to be here is in place. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=283.68s)]
*  And that our fight for justice, our fight for peace, is a fight for humanity, not only [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=289.68s)]
*  for the Palestinian people. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=295.68s)]
*  The judge rebuked the government when they said you couldn't travel over state lines [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=297.68s)]
*  from Vermont, where you were just released from jail, to your graduation. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=302.68s)]
*  Can you explain what he said? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=306.68s)]
*  Judge Crawford has been a person who is holding the scale of justice very firmly. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=310.68s)]
*  This is what I am fighting for. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=317.68s)]
*  Justice and peace go hand in hand. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=320.68s)]
*  This is what I want. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=324.68s)]
*  And Judge Crawford has granted me to come to New York City to participate in events, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=326.68s)]
*  in protests. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=333.68s)]
*  That's my free speech right, first amendment right in this country. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=335.68s)]
*  And has granted me the chance to be with the community that I love. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=340.68s)]
*  And they love me and they love me. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=343.68s)]
*  You saw how they cheered me up. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=345.68s)]
*  It doesn't matter what the Trump administration is saying and accusing me of. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=348.68s)]
*  Columbia University gave the answer and comes from the students and from the professors, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=352.68s)]
*  not from senior administration or from unjust government or unjust laws. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=358.68s)]
*  You got a standing ovation when you graduated. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=363.68s)]
*  Can you talk about how you felt at that point? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=366.68s)]
*  I felt honored and humbled. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=370.68s)]
*  I felt that the inner child who has suffered, and the story of many other children who are [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=372.68s)]
*  suffering and who have suffered is being seen and acknowledged. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=379.68s)]
*  And I felt that people stood up for justice, for peace, for human rights and for international [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=383.68s)]
*  law. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=390.68s)]
*  This is my message. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=391.68s)]
*  A message of peace, a message for justice. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=392.68s)]
*  What did you think of the valedictory, the valedictorian who referenced the number of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=394.68s)]
*  people who are not here at graduation? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=399.68s)]
*  He's a brave, he's a very brave man. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=401.68s)]
*  And you have to keep in mind that he comes from an Irish heritage, from resilience, from [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=403.68s)]
*  resistance, from understanding that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=410.68s)]
*  as Martin Luther King has said. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=416.68s)]
*  What this university is doing is ridiculous. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=419.68s)]
*  They are suspending students. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=422.68s)]
*  They are expelling students just for protesting against the war. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=424.68s)]
*  What kind of values this university would have if it doesn't allow itself to align [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=430.68s)]
*  with international law and human rights? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=436.68s)]
*  What worth our degrees? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=439.68s)]
*  You see the names of philosophers, you see the names of philosophers engraved on buildings [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=441.68s)]
*  in this university, the most significant ones, Law Library and Butler Library. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=450.68s)]
*  What is the point if we are studying those philosophers and we are just not bringing [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=456.68s)]
*  those theories into action? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=461.68s)]
*  Justice, education, interconnectedness, peace, harmony, empathy, forgiveness. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=463.68s)]
*  This university is a betrayal to all of those values. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=472.68s)]
*  And what it's doing here is degrading and destroying the democratic system that depends [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=477.68s)]
*  on votes, on sharing voices, and they're telling the students and the professors, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=484.68s)]
*  you don't matter, but the students' voice is much louder than the money that the university [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=489.68s)]
*  receives. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=493.68s)]
*  We're standing next to SIPA, the school you hope to go to in the fall. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=494.68s)]
*  Do you think you'll be able to? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=498.68s)]
*  You're in an immigration proceeding now, even though you were going towards naturalization [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=500.68s)]
*  and U.S. citizenship. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=505.68s)]
*  Look, I plan on attending SIPA. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=507.68s)]
*  There are many obstacles, obstacles with the immigration system, obstacles with the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  federal justice system, and an obstacle with this university that refused to give me a [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=522.6800000000001s)]
*  scholarship. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  They gave me zero funding, even though they accepted me based on merit. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  I tell them that I am coming here to be in the middle of this fire because I am a peacemaker, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=534.68s)]
*  because I am a firefighter. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=541.68s)]
*  And I will come here to study international affairs, focusing on diplomacy and security [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=543.68s)]
*  and focusing on conflict resolution and peacemaking. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=550.68s)]
*  This is the story of hope, from a refugee camp to Colombia. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=554.68s)]
*  From a refugee camp to Colombia, Palestinian student activist Mohsen Madhawi speaking after [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=559.68s)]
*  graduating from Columbia University on Monday, just three weeks after a federal judge had [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=564.68s)]
*  him released from a Vermont prison. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=571.68s)]
*  During his interview, Mohsen Madhawi referenced the valedictorian address by the Irish student [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=574.68s)]
*  Peter Gorman. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=579.68s)]
*  Good morning to the 2025 graduates of the School of General Studies. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=581.68s)]
*  And congratulations! [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=585.68s)]
*  I can't say how shocked and honored I was to find myself as a valedictorian this year. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=589.68s)]
*  It begs the question, how does one speak to these people I found myself graduating alongside, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=597.68s)]
*  the incredible depth and breadth of experience out here? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=602.68s)]
*  How does one speak in these times, to people whose Columbia experience has been defined [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=605.68s)]
*  by personal and political struggle, by protest and by the university's response to it? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=610.68s)]
*  We've been challenged not just to learn, but to act. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=615.68s)]
*  In making that decision, some of us have paid a price. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=620.68s)]
*  As we graduate, we should remember that this is the first time since 1968 that a Columbia [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=625.68s)]
*  graduating class has been reduced by suspension for political protest. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=630.68s)]
*  And the first time since Robert Burke in 1936 that a Columbia class has been reduced [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=645.68s)]
*  by expulsion for political protest. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=650.68s)]
*  Excerpts of Peter Gorman giving his valedictory address at Columbia University on Monday. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=655.68s)]
*  After the ceremony, I spoke to Palestinian-American student activists who also just graduated, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=662.68s)]
*  Mariam Alwan. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=669.68s)]
*  I was arrested and suspended for the first encampment. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=671.68s)]
*  And actually I was wearing a Columbia shirt when I was arrested, and that was the last [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=674.68s)]
*  time that I wore the Columbia logo, and now I'm wearing it again now that I'm graduating. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=678.68s)]
*  I honestly did not think that I would graduate, given the level of repression against pro-Palestinian [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=683.68s)]
*  students. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=690.68s)]
*  So it's a really powerful moment for me, but at the same time I feel almost guilty because [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=691.68s)]
*  so many are not able to graduate, not only the students who have been disciplined at [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=699.68s)]
*  Columbia, but also the students at Zip who have been killed. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=703.68s)]
*  And so I wanted to do everything I can to show that I'm thinking of them. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=709.68s)]
*  As the reception went on outside the gates of Columbia University, dozens of Columbia [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=716.68s)]
*  professors lined up to hold a vigil around the continued detention of Mahmoud Khalil [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=722.68s)]
*  and other students. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=732.68s)]
*  This is Columbia Medical School Public Health biostatistics professor Melanie Wall. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=734.68s)]
*  Melanie Wall, professor of biostatistics in the Department of Psychiatry in the Medical [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=740.68s)]
*  Center at Columbia University. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=746.68s)]
*  The students who have been protesting and we don't think that the government should [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=748.68s)]
*  keep this case for anti-Semitism being the excuse for why our grants are being taken [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=754.68s)]
*  away and that we have many different things that we're wanting the university to do in [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=761.68s)]
*  terms of self-governance. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=769.68s)]
*  We are wanting them to not take over the university senate. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=771.68s)]
*  We're wanting them to allow faculty to be part of the choice of the next university [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=775.68s)]
*  president. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=781.68s)]
*  We want to protect students and scholars from being able to protest. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=782.68s)]
*  And we want all those things, as well as we want them to fight back against the Trump [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=787.68s)]
*  administration to keep our grants. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=791.68s)]
*  And so it's not a medical campus. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=795.68s)]
*  That was Columbia University biostatistics professor Melanie Wall. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=798.68s)]
*  And that does it for our show. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzV1XNKoUAo&t=805.68s)]
