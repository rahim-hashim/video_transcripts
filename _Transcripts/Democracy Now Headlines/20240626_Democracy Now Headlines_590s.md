# Top U.S. & World Headlines — June 26, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhKIYXxFKTs)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has returned to his home country of Australia, a free man,
*  following a plea agreement with the U.S. government.
*  Assange landed in the Australian capital, Canberra, today to cheers from supporters.
*  His arrival caps a more than 12-year legal ordeal, after Assange published classified
*  documents detailing U.S. war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan.
*  Press freedom groups have denounced successive U.S. administrations for targeting Assange,
*  who faced 175 years in a U.S. prison if he'd been extradited and convicted on espionage
*  and hacking charges.
*  On Tuesday, Julian Assange flew from London to the Pacific Island nation of Saipan in
*  the northern Mariana Islands, where he's pled guilty in a U.S. district court to a
*  single felony count of illegally obtaining and disclosing national security material.
*  He was granted credit for time served during his imprisonment at London's Belmarsh Prison
*  and allowed to walk free.
*  This is Assange's lawyer, Barry Pollack.
*  The court today determined that no harm was caused by Mr. Assange's publications.
*  We know that they were newsworthy.
*  We know that they were quoted by every major media outlet on the planet.
*  And we know that they revealed important information.
*  That is called journalism.
*  The United States prosecuted that.
*  They exposed Mr. Assange to 175 years in prison.
*  That is what has a chilling effect.
*  Today, a decision that it's time for Mr. Assange to go home, that doesn't have a
*  chilling effect.
*  The chilling effect is the United States pursuing journalism as a crime.
*  I hope this is the first and last time that ever occurs.
*  We'll have more on the historic release of Julian Assange.
*  We'll hear from Stella, his wife, his attorneys and people from Cambra to Britain to New
*  York after headlines.
*  In Gaza, an Israeli air strike on a residential building in Beit L'Hia has killed at least
*  15 people, with others feared trapped under the rubble.
*  Dozens more were injured in the assault.
*  Elsewhere, more than a dozen Palestinians were rescued with injuries after an Israeli
*  assault on Gaza City's Deraj neighborhood.
*  Meanwhile, a new report by a U.N. partner agency finds a half a million people in the
*  Gaza Strip face catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity, putting them at risk of severe
*  malnutrition and death.
*  The report found nearly all of Gaza's 2.3 million people are experiencing acute hunger.
*  Maximo Toretto is chief economist at the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization.
*  The latest data show that on a regular basis, more than half of the population—more than
*  half of the population does not have any food to eat in the house, and over 20 percent go
*  in entire days and nights without eating.
*  Members of the medical aid charity Doctors Without Borders have strongly condemned the
*  killing of their colleague Fadi Awadyeh, a 33-year-old physiotherapist.
*  Awadyeh was killed, along with five other people, including three children, as he was
*  riding his bicycle to work.
*  This killing came as the United Nations warned it will be forced to suspend aid operations
*  across Gaza unless urgent steps are taken to protect humanitarian workers.
*  Meanwhile, a major new investigation carried out by dozens of journalists with the nonprofit
*  Forbidden Stories has revealed at least 18 media workers were likely killed or wounded
*  by precision strikes launched from Israeli drones in violation of the laws of war.
*  were wearing press vests at the time and were identifiable as journalists.
*  The Committee to Protect Journalists reports at least 108 media workers are among the more
*  than 37,600 Palestinians killed by Israel's war on Gaza since October 7, making it the
*  deadliest conflict for journalists that the Committee to Protect Journalists has ever
*  recorded.
*  In Kenya, at least 22 people have been killed and dozens more injured as nationwide protests
*  intensify against a highly unpopular tax hike.
*  Kenyan lawmakers approved the bill Tuesday as police fired live rounds, rubber bullets
*  and tear gas at thousands of protesters who stormed Kenya's parliament in Nairobi, angered
*  by the measure, which would skyrocket the cost of goods and services in Kenya to help
*  pay off billions in foreign debt, including to the International Monetary Fund and World
*  Bank.
*  The demonstrations also continued in other parts of Kenya.
*  These are protesters in the coastal city of Mombasa.
*  We'll have more on Kenya later in the broadcast.
*  We'll go to Nairobi to speak with, among others, President Barack Obama's half-sister,
*  Alma Obama, who was tear gassed yesterday by Kenyan police.
*  This comes as 400 Kenyan soldiers arrived in Haiti Tuesday.
*  It's the first contingent of U.S.-backed troops sent to combat worsening gang violence
*  in Haiti.
*  Many Haitians have opposed the mission, saying past international interventions have contributed
*  to political destabilization and humanitarian crises in Haiti.
*  Here in New York, Westchester County Executive George Latimer has defeated progressive congressmember
*  Jamal Bowman following the most expensive primary race in U.S. history.
*  Latimer was encouraged to launch his primary challenge for New York's 16th congressional
*  district by the Democratic Majority for Israel Political Action Committee after Bowman repeatedly
*  called for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and accused Israel of genocide.
*  race top $23 million, much of it from pro-Israel groups like AIPAC.
*  Other supporters of Latimer included onward together Hillary Clinton's PAC and Nelson
*  Peltz, a Republican billionaire who's backing Donald Trump for the presidency.
*  Jamal Bowman spoke to supporters after his primary defeat Tuesday night.
*  This movement has always been about justice.
*  It has always been about humanity.
*  It has always been about equality.
*  And it was always, has always been about our collective liberation.
*  In Colorado, far-right Republican congressmember Lauren Boebert has won the Republican primary
*  race for the fourth congressional district.
*  Boebert moved to a more solidly Republican district after she narrowly won re-election
*  to represent Colorado's third district in 2022.
*  Lauren Boebert is a far-right Trump supporter, an election denier and infamously vowed to
*  carry her Glock pistol on the Capitol grounds.
*  The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for two Russian officials
*  accused of orchestrating missile strikes on Ukrainian electric power plants, which is
*  a war crime.
*  The ICC warrants against former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and military general Valery
*  Gorasimov were welcomed by U.S. officials.
*  Neither Russia nor Ukraine nor the United States is a party to the Rome Statute, which
*  established the ICC.
*  The Biden administration has attempted to discredit the court's jurisdiction as it's
*  seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister
*  Yoav Gallant for possible war crimes committed in Gaza.
*  Gallant met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, D.C., this week, and
*  posed for photos together.
*  And in Russia, a closed-door trial is underway in the city of Yekaterinburg for U.S. citizen
*  Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.
*  Russian prosecutors accuse him of collecting secret information about a military factory
*  for the CIA charges, the Wall Street Journal calls baseless.
*  Earlier today, Gershkovich made an appearance in a glass cage inside a Russian courtroom.
*  His head was shaved.
*  He appeared calm as he briefly smiled and nodded at supporters.
*  Stuart Wilson, the U.S. Consul General at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, said Russian officials
*  have not provided consular access to Gershkovich.
*  Have you managed to visit Evan?
*  Here?
*  No, no, we have not.
*  Are you going to?
*  Is it allowed there?
*  I don't know.
*  Oh, we put in a request.
*  If convicted on espionage charges, Gershkovich faces up to 20 years in a Russian penal colony.
*  And those are some of the headlines.

*  the world.
