As the Israeli military kills two more Palestinian journalists in Gaza, a new documentary by Zeteo has uncovered critical details about Israel's killing three years ago of the acclaimed Palestinian-American Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. The film identifies for the first time the Israeli soldier who allegedly shot Abu Akleh. We get response when we speak with two members of Abu Akleh's family — her brother Anton and her niece Lina — as well as the documentary's executive producer Dion Nissenbaum and Zeteo founder Mehdi Hasan.

*  We begin today's show looking at Israel's ongoing targeting of Palestinian journalists. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=18.2s)]
*  A recent report by the Costs of War Project at Brown University described the war in Gaza [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=22.32s)]
*  as the, quote, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=26.96s)]
*  "'worst ever conflict' for reporters in history." [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=27.76s)]
*  By one count, Israel has killed 214 Palestinian journalists in Gaza over the past 18 months, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=31.28s)]
*  including two journalists killed on Wednesday, Yahya Sabih and Noor al-Din Abdo. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=37.72s)]
*  Yahya Sabih died just hours after his wife gave birth to their first child. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  Meanwhile, new details have emerged about the killing of Shirin Abu Akhli, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=48.6s)]
*  the renowned Palestinian-American Al Jazeera journalist [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  who was fatally shot by an Israeli soldier three years ago on May 11, 2022. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=55.08s)]
*  She was killed while covering an Israeli army assault on the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=60.76s)]
*  Shirin and another reporter were against a stone wall wearing blue helmets and blue flat jackets [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=65.96s)]
*  clearly emblazoned with the word, press. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=71.16s)]
*  Shirin was shot in the head. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=74.52s)]
*  Shirin was known throughout the Arab world for her decades of tireless reporting on Palestine. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=76.44s)]
*  Israel initially claimed she'd been shot by Palestinian militants, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=82.12s)]
*  but later acknowledged she was most likely shot by an Israeli soldier. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=86.12s)]
*  But Israel has never identified the soldier who fired the fatal shot [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=90.28s)]
*  or allowed the soldier to be questioned by U.S. investigators. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  But a new documentary just released by Zateo has identified and named the Israeli soldier [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=98.28s)]
*  for the first time. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=105.0s)]
*  This is the trailer to the documentary, Who Killed Shirin? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  That soldier looked down his scope and could see the blue vest and that it said press. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  That's my place, yes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=123.0s)]
*  U.S. personnel have never had access to those who are believed to have committed those shootings. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  No one has been held to account. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=142.36s)]
*  Justice has not been served. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=145.32s)]
*  She is the first American Palestinian journalist who has been killed by Israeli forces. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=147.72s)]
*  I want to know who killed Shirin. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=153.88s)]
*  How are we going to find the shooter? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=156.68s)]
*  He's got a phone call set up with this Israeli soldier who was there that day. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=159.88s)]
*  We just have to go over to Israel. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  Did you ever talk to the guy who fired the shots? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=167.72s)]
*  Go off. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=170.76s)]
*  I'm the only president. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=171.64s)]
*  The U.S. should have actually come forward and actually pressed the fact that an American [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=174.76s)]
*  citizen was killed intentionally, I guess. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=178.92s)]
*  The drones are still ongoing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=186.76s)]
*  The explosion's going off. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=188.36s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=191.16s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=192.2s)]
*  The drones are still ongoing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=193.56s)]
*  The explosion's going off. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=194.6s)]
*  Holy s—, you got a name. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=197.4s)]
*  But here's the twist. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=201.88s)]
*  The trailer for the new Zateo documentary, Who Killed Shirin? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=205.24s)]
*  The film identifies the Israeli soldier who allegedly killed Shirin Abu Akhlai as [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=209.16s)]
*  Alon Skagio, who would later be killed during an Israeli military operation last June in Janin, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=214.6s)]
*  the same city where Shirin was fatally shot. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=220.76s)]
*  We're joined right now by four guests, including two members of Shirin Abu Akhlai's family. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=224.2s)]
*  Her brother Anton, or Tony, and her niece, Lena. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=230.44s)]
*  They're both in North Bergen, New Jersey. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=234.04s)]
*  We're also joined by Mehdi Hassan, the founder and editor-in-chief of Zateo, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=236.67999999999998s)]
*  and by Diane Nissenbaum, the executive producer of Who Killed Shirin, the correspondent on the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=241.95999999999998s)]
*  documentary, a longtime Wall Street Journal foreign correspondent based in Jerusalem [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=247.88s)]
*  and other cities, a former foreign correspondent. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=252.92s)]
*  He was twice nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=255.96s)]
*  We welcome you all to Democracy Now! [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=259.32s)]
*  Diane, we're going to begin with you. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=261.88s)]
*  This is the third anniversary, May 11th exactly, of the death of Shirin Abu Akhlai. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=263.8s)]
*  Talk about your revelation, what you exposed in this documentary. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=270.84s)]
*  Well, there are two things that were very important for the documentary. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=276.91999999999996s)]
*  The first thing was we wanted to find the soldier who killed Shirin. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=281.08s)]
*  It had been one of the most closely guarded secrets in Israel. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  U.S. officials said that if they wanted to determine if there was a crime here, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  if there was a human rights violation, they needed to talk to this soldier [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=295.4s)]
*  to find out what he was thinking when he shot her. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  And we set out to find him. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=302.76s)]
*  And we did. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=305.0s)]
*  We did what the U.S. government never did. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=305.88s)]
*  And it turned out he had been killed. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=308.76s)]
*  So we were never able to answer that question, what he was thinking. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=310.68s)]
*  But the other revelation that I think is as significant in this documentary [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=315.16s)]
*  is that the initial U.S. assessment of her shooting was that that soldier intentionally shot her [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=319.88s)]
*  and that he could tell that she was wearing a blue flak jacket with press across it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=328.6s)]
*  That assessment was essentially overruled by the Biden administration, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=337.0s)]
*  which came out and said exactly the opposite. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=342.20000000000005s)]
*  That's a fairly startling revelation that the Biden administration and the Israeli government [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  essentially were doing everything they could to cover up what happened that day to Shirin Abu Akhlai. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=351.88s)]
*  Well, let's go to a clip from the documentary Who Killed Shirin? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=357.88s)]
*  in which Dayan Nissenbaum, our guest, speaks with former State Department official Andrew Miller. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=361.48s)]
*  He was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Israeli-Palestinian Affairs in 2022 when Shirin was killed. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=367.08s)]
*  It's nearly 100 percent certain that an Israeli soldier, likely a sniper, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=375.0s)]
*  fired the shots that killed Shirin Abu Akhlai. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=381.72s)]
*  Based on all the information we have, it is not credible to suggest that there were [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=385.8s)]
*  targets either in front of or behind Shirin Abu Akhlai. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=391.8s)]
*  The fact that the official Israeli position remains that this was a case of crossfire, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=397.64s)]
*  this the entire episode was a mistake as opposed to potentially a mistaken identification [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=405.0s)]
*  or the deliberate targeting of this individual points to, I think, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  a broader policy of seeking to manage the narrative. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=419.32s)]
*  And did these Israelis ever make the soldier available to the U.S. to talk about it? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=422.84s)]
*  No, and the Israelis were not willing to present the person for even informal questioning. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=428.36s)]
*  That was State Department official, former State Department official Andrew Miller, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=435.32s)]
*  speaking in the Zateo documentary, Who Killed Shirin? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=439.32s)]
*  He was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Israeli-Palestinian Affairs [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=443.24s)]
*  in 2022 when Shirin was killed. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=447.56s)]
*  I want to go to Shirin's family, whom we have as guests, Anton, Abu Akhlai and Lina, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=450.44s)]
*  who are joining us from New Jersey. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=457.88s)]
*  You both watched the film for the first time last night when it premiered here in New York City. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=460.44s)]
*  Lina, if you could begin by responding to the revelations in the film. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=466.59999999999997s)]
*  Hi, Amy. Hi. Thank you for having us. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=474.91999999999996s)]
*  Honestly, we always welcome and we appreciate journalists who [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=478.52s)]
*  try to uncover the killing of Shirin, but also who shed light on her legacy. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=485.08s)]
*  And the documentary that was released by Zateo and by Dayan, it really [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=490.12s)]
*  revealed findings that we didn't know before, but we've always known that it was an Israeli soldier [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=499.08000000000004s)]
*  who killed Shirin. And we know how the U.S. administration failed our family, failed the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=505.56s)]
*  U.S. citizen and failed the journalist, really. And that should be a scandal in and of itself. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=511.64000000000004s)]
*  But most importantly, for us as a family, it's not just about one soldier. It's about the entire [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=519.48s)]
*  chain of command. It's not just the person who pulled the trigger, but who ordered the killing [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=526.36s)]
*  and the military commanders, the elected officials. So really, it's the entire chain of commands that [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=532.2s)]
*  needs to be held to account for the killing of a journalist who was in clear press vest, press gear [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=538.44s)]
*  marked as a journalist. And Anton, if you could respond, Shirin, of course, was your younger sister. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=545.96s)]
*  What was your response watching the documentary last night? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=554.44s)]
*  It's very painful to look at all these scenes again, but I really [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=561.1600000000001s)]
*  extend my appreciation to Zateo and all those who supported and worked on this [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=569.4000000000001s)]
*  documentary, which was very revealing. Many things we didn't know. The cover-up by the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=575.24s)]
*  Biden administration, this thing was new to us. He promised. First statements came out from the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=582.52s)]
*  White House and from the State Department stressed on the importance of holding those responsible [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=589.5600000000001s)]
*  accountable. And apparently, in one of the interviews held in this documentary, he never [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=595.64s)]
*  raised—President Biden never raised this issue with Bennett, at that time the prime minister. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=602.2s)]
*  So that's shocking to us to know. It was a total cover-up, contradictory to what they promised us. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=607.5600000000001s)]
*  And that's, like Lena just said, it's a betrayal not only to the family, not only to Shirin, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=615.88s)]
*  but the whole American nation. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=622.5200000000001s)]
*  Maddie Hassan, you've backed this documentary. It's the first big documentary Zateo is putting [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=624.28s)]
*  out. It's also the first anniversary of the founding of Zateo. Can you talk about the proof [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=633.0s)]
*  that you feel is here in the documentary, that alone, Skadjo, this—and explain who he is and [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=642.6s)]
*  the unit he was a part of? Diane, it's quite something when you go to his grave, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=652.44s)]
*  but how you can absolutely be sure this is the man. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=658.44s)]
*  D. D. N. N. N. N. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=662.2800000000001s)]
*  So, Amy and Numeen, thanks for having us here. I've been on this show many times, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=663.1600000000001s)]
*  and I just want to say great to be here on set with both of you. Thank you for what you do. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=667.32s)]
*  This is actually our second documentary, but it is our biggest so far, because the revelations [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=670.9200000000001s)]
*  in this film that Diane and the team put out are huge in many ways, identifying the soldiers you [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  mentioned, Alan Skadjo, identifying the Biden cover-up, which we just heard Tony Abouakle point [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=681.48s)]
*  out. People didn't realize just how big that cover-up was. Remember, Joe Biden was the man who said, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=686.6800000000001s)]
*  if you harm an American, we will respond. And what is very clear in the case of Shireen Abouakle, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=691.96s)]
*  an American citizen who spent a lot of her life in New Jersey, they did not respond. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=697.0s)]
*  On terms of the soldier itself, when Diane came to me and said, we want to make this film, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=702.52s)]
*  it'll be almost like a true crime documentary. We're going to go out and find out who did it, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=706.6800000000001s)]
*  because we all, everyone followed the story. You guys covered it in 2022. It was a huge story in [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=709.8s)]
*  the world. But three years later, to not even know the name of the shooter, and I was, well, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=713.7199999999999s)]
*  we'll be able to find this out. It's one of Israel's most closely guarded secrets. And yet, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=718.92s)]
*  Diane and his team were able to do the reporting that got inside of Douv Divan, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=722.3599999999999s)]
*  this elite special forces unit in Israel. It literally means the cherry on top. That's how [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=727.24s)]
*  proud they are of their eliteness. And yet, no matter how elite you are, Israel's way of [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=732.92s)]
*  fighting wars means you kill innocent people. And what comes out in the film from interviews, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=739.9599999999999s)]
*  not just with a soldier, an Israeli soldier who speaks in the film and talks about, hey, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=744.4399999999999s)]
*  if you see a camera, you take the shot. But also speaking to Chris Van Hollen, United States [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=748.8399999999999s)]
*  Senator for Maryland, who's been one of the few Democratic voices critical of Biden in the Senate, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=754.5999999999999s)]
*  who says there's going to be no change in Israel's rules of engagement over the years. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=758.52s)]
*  And therefore, it was so important on multiple levels to do this film, to identify the shooter, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=762.28s)]
*  because of course, as you pointed out in your news headlines, Amy, they just killed 100 Palestinians [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=766.76s)]
*  yesterday. So this is not some old story from history where this happened in 2022 and we're [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=771.88s)]
*  going back to this. Everything that happened since, you could argue, flows from that. The Americans [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=777.3199999999999s)]
*  who've been killed, the journalists who've been killed in Gaza, Palestinians, the sense of impunity [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=783.0s)]
*  that Israel has and Israel's soldiers have. There are reports that Israeli soldiers are saying to [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=787.4s)]
*  Palestinians, hey, Trump has our back. Hey, the U.S. government has our back. And it wasn't just [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=792.36s)]
*  Trump. It was Joe Biden, too. And that was why it was so important to make this film, to identify [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=797.48s)]
*  the shooter, to call out Israel's practices when it comes to journalists and to call out the U.S. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=801.16s)]
*  role. I just want to go to Dayan. For people who aren't familiar with the progression of what the [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=805.56s)]
*  Biden administration said, the serious cover-up not only by Israel, but of its main military [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=811.56s)]
*  weapons supplier and supporter of its war on Gaza. And that is Joe Biden. From the beginning, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=819.4s)]
*  first Israel said it was a Palestinian militant. At that point, what did President Biden say? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=825.4s)]
*  So at the very beginning, they said that they wanted the shooter to be prosecuted. They used [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=830.04s)]
*  that word at the State Department and said, this person who killed an American journalist [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=835.0799999999999s)]
*  should be prosecuted. But when it started to become clear that it was probably an Israeli [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=840.28s)]
*  soldier, their tone shifted and it became talking about vague calls for accountability or changes [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=846.6s)]
*  to the rules of engagement, which never actually happened. So you got to a point where [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=854.36s)]
*  the Israeli government admitted it was likely them. The U.S. government called for them to [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=862.12s)]
*  change the rules of engagement. And the Israeli government said no. And we have this interview [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=867.56s)]
*  in the film with Senator Chris Van Hollen, who says that essentially Israel was giving the middle [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=873.88s)]
*  finger to the U.S. government on this. And we have seen since that time more Americans being [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=878.76s)]
*  killed in the West Bank, dozens and dozens and dozens of journalists being killed with no [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=885.56s)]
*  accountability. And we would like to see that change. This is a trajectory that you're seeing. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=892.52s)]
*  The blue vest no longer provides any protection for journalists in Israel. The Israeli military [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=900.68s)]
*  itself has said that wearing a blue vest with press on it does not necessarily mean that you [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=906.76s)]
*  are a journalist. They are saying that terrorists wear blue vests too. So if you are a journalist [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=914.1999999999999s)]
*  operating in the West Bank now, you have to assume that the Israeli military could target you. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=919.96s)]
*  Well, let's go to another clip from the film Who Killed Shirin, which features Ali Samoudi, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=928.76s)]
*  Shirin Abu Akhlai's producer, who was with Shirin when she was killed and was himself shot and [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=935.64s)]
*  injured. In the clip, he speaks to the journalist Fatima Abdulkarim. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=941.24s)]
*  We are set up here now, even though it's we were supposed to meet at the location where you got [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=945.32s)]
*  injured and Shirin got killed. We are five minutes from the location in Maidan Al-Awda, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=954.0400000000001s)]
*  but you could lose your soul in the five minutes it would take us to reach it. You could be hit by [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=961.4000000000001s)]
*  army bullets. They could arrest you. So it is essentially impossible to get there. I believe [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=965.48s)]
*  the big disaster which prevented the occupation from being punished and repeating these crimes [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=972.28s)]
*  is the neglect and indifference by many of the institutions, especially American ones, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=977.72s)]
*  which continue to defend the occupation. We're now approaching the third anniversary [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=982.76s)]
*  of Shirin's death. How did that affect you? During that period, the occupation was making [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=989.24s)]
*  preparations for a dangerous scenario in the Jenin refugee camp. And for this reason, they [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=996.4399999999999s)]
*  didn't want witnesses. They opened fire on us in order to terrorize us enough that we wouldn't go [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1001.48s)]
*  back to the camp. And in that sense, they partially succeeded. Since then, we have been overcome by [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1007.32s)]
*  fear. From the moment Shirin was killed, I said and continue to say and will continue to say [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1013.16s)]
*  that this bullet was meant to prevent the Palestinian media from the documentation [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1021.48s)]
*  and exposure of the occupation's crimes. That was Ali Samoudi, Shirin Abu Akhlai's producer, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1025.6399999999999s)]
*  who was with Shirin when she was killed and was himself shot and injured. We should note Ali [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1033.0s)]
*  Samoudi was just detained by Israeli forces in late April. The Palestinian journalist, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1038.52s)]
*  Maryam Barhouti, recently wrote, Ali Samoudi was beaten so bad by Israeli soldiers he was [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1043.3999999999999s)]
*  immediately hospitalized. This man has been one of the few journalists that continues reporting on [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1049.0s)]
*  Israeli military abuses north of the West Bank, despite the continued risk on his life. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1054.2s)]
*  Maryam Barhouti wrote. The Committee to Protect Journalists spoke to the journalist's son, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1060.6000000000001s)]
*  Mohammed Al Samoudi, who told CPG, quote, My father suffers from several illnesses, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1065.48s)]
*  including diabetes, high blood pressure and a stomach ulcer. He needs a diabetes injection [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1071.4s)]
*  every two days and a specific diet. It appears he was subjected to assault and medical neglect at [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1076.76s)]
*  the interrogation center. Our lawyer told us he was transferred to an Israeli hospital [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1082.52s)]
*  after a major setback in his health. We don't know where he is being held, interrogated or even [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1087.4s)]
*  the hospital to which he was taken. My father has been forcibly disappeared, he said. So, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1092.52s)]
*  Dion Nusimba, if you could give us the latest. You spoke to Ali Samoudi for the documentary [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1098.44s)]
*  and now he's been detained. Yeah, his words were prophetic, right? He talks about this was an [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1105.08s)]
*  attempt to silence journalists. And my colleague Fatima says the same thing, that these are ongoing [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1110.44s)]
*  progressive efforts to silence Palestinian journalists. And we don't know where Ali is. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1116.6000000000001s)]
*  He has not actually been charged with anything yet. He is one of the most respected journalists [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1123.0800000000002s)]
*  in the West Bank. And we are just seeing this progression going on. So he, the latest we know [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1129.0800000000002s)]
*  is he was supposed to have a hearing and that hearing has now been delayed to May 13th, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1137.08s)]
*  Ali Samoudi. That's right. And he has yet to be charged. So I want to go back to Lina Abouakla, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1141.8s)]
*  who's in New Jersey, where where Shireen grew up. Lina, you were listed on Time magazine's 100 [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1151.0s)]
*  emerging leaders for publicly demanding scrutiny of Israel's treatment of Palestinians. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1160.84s)]
*  The horror and again our condolences on the death of your aunt, on the killing of your aunt, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1165.64s)]
*  and also to Anton, Shireen's brother. Lina, you've also of course spoken to Ali Samoudi. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1173.0s)]
*  This continues now. He's in detention. His son says just disappeared. What are you demanding [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1182.76s)]
*  right now? We have a new administration. We've moved from the Biden administration to the Trump [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1190.44s)]
*  administration. And are you in touch with them? Are they speaking to you? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1196.6s)]
*  Well, our demands haven't changed. From day one, we're calling for the U.S. administration to [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1204.3600000000001s)]
*  complete its investigation or for the FBI to continue its investigation and to finally [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1211.8s)]
*  release, to finally hold someone to account. And we have enough evidence that could have been, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1221.24s)]
*  that the administration could have used to expedite this case. But unfortunately, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1230.84s)]
*  this new administration as well, no one has spoken to us. We haven't been in touch with anyone. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1237.32s)]
*  And it's just been radio silence since. For us, as I said, our demands have never changed. It's [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1242.28s)]
*  been always to hold the entire system to account, the entire chain of command, the military, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1249.64s)]
*  for the killing of an American citizen, a journalist, a Palestinian, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1256.1200000000001s)]
*  and Palestinian American journalist. As we've been talking, targeting journalists isn't [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1261.32s)]
*  happening just by shooting at them or killing them. There's so many different forms of [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1268.12s)]
*  targeting journalists, especially in Gaza, in the West Bank, in Jerusalem. So for us, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1273.8s)]
*  it's really important as a family that we don't see other families experience what we are going [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1280.12s)]
*  through for this, for impunity, for Israel's impunity to end, because at the end of the day, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1285.96s)]
*  accountability is the only way to put an end to this impunity. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1293.64s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN I am horrified to ask this question to Shireen's family members, to Lena, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1298.28s)]
*  to Tony, Shireen's brother. But the revelation in the film—we were all there last night at its [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1303.96s)]
*  premiere in New York—that the Israeli soldiers are using a photograph of Shireen's face for [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1311.32s)]
*  target practice. Tony Abulakla, if you could respond. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1318.36s)]
*  TONY ABULAKLA You know, there is no words to describe our [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1322.9199999999998s)]
*  sorrow and pain hearing this. But, you know, I would just want to know why. Why would they [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1331.3999999999999s)]
*  do things? What did Shireen do to them for them to use her as a target practice? You know, this is [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1337.88s)]
*  absolutely barbaric act, unjustified, unjustified. And we really hope that this [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1345.16s)]
*  U.S. administration will be able to put an end to all this impunity they are enjoying. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1355.16s)]
*  If they didn't enjoy all this impunity, they wouldn't have been doing this, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1360.92s)]
*  practicing on a journalist. Why? You know, you can practice on anything, but on a journalist, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1366.04s)]
*  this shows that this targeting of more journalists, whether in Gaza and Palestine, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1371.72s)]
*  it's systematic. It's been planned for, and they've been targeting and shutting off those voices, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1377.88s)]
*  those reports from reaching anywhere in the world. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1385.24s)]
*  NERMEEN SHAIKH AL-ALI KHAN, Journalist, Shireen's Family Members [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1388.28s)]
*  And, Anton, if you could say—you know, you mentioned last night as well—Shireen was, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1388.76s)]
*  in fact, extremely cautious as a journalist. If you could elaborate on that, what precisely? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1393.64s)]
*  ANTON KHABALI, Journalist, Shireen's Family Members Absolutely. Shireen was very careful. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1400.2s)]
*  Every time she's in the field, she would take her time to put on the gear, the required helmet, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1405.48s)]
*  the vest with press written on it, before going there. She also [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1414.8400000000001s)]
*  tried to identify herself as a journalist, whether to the Israelis or to the Palestinians. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1420.4399999999998s)]
*  So she's not attacked, and she always went by the book, followed the rules, how to act, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1428.04s)]
*  how to be careful, how to speak to those people involved, so she can protect herself. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1434.4399999999998s)]
*  But, unfortunately, he was—this soldier, as stated in the documentary, targeted Shireen [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1440.6s)]
*  just because she's Shireen and she's a journalist. That's it. There is no other explanation. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1450.1200000000001s)]
*  Sixteen bullets were fired on Shireen. Not even her helmet nor the vest she was wearing [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1455.96s)]
*  were able to protect her, unfortunately. MAHDI HASSAN, Journalist, Shireen's Family Members [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1462.84s)]
*  Mehdi Hassan, you wanted to respond. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1465.96s)]
*  So Tony asks, why? Why would you do this? Why would you target not just a journalist in the [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1468.28s)]
*  field, but then use her face for target practices, Dayan and his team reveal in the film? And there [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1473.88s)]
*  is, unfortunately, a very simple answer to that question, which is that the Israeli military, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1479.08s)]
*  and not just the Israeli military, but many people in our world today have dehumanized Palestinians. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1483.8s)]
*  There is the removal of humanity from the people you are pressing, occupying, subjugating, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1488.36s)]
*  and killing. It doesn't matter if you're an American citizen. It doesn't matter if you have [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1492.68s)]
*  a press jacket on. It only matters that you are Palestinian in the sniper sites. And that is how [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1496.04s)]
*  they have managed to pull off the killing of so many journalists, so many children. The first [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1500.84s)]
*  documentary we commissioned last year was called Israel's Real Extremism. And it was about the [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1505.08s)]
*  Israeli soldiers who go into Gaza and make TikTok videos wearing Palestinian women's underwear, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1509.3999999999999s)]
*  playing with Palestinian children's toys. It is the ultimate form of dehumanization, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1515.8s)]
*  the idea that these people don't count, their lives have no value. And what's so tragic and [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1519.72s)]
*  shocking, and the film exposes this, is that Joe Biden, forget the Israeli military, Joe Biden [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1524.4399999999998s)]
*  also joined in that dehumanization. Do you remember at the start of this conflict, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1529.72s)]
*  when he comes out and he says, well, I'm not sure I believe the Palestinian death toll numbers, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1534.12s)]
*  when he puts out a statement at the 100 days after October 7th and doesn't mention Palestinian [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1538.2s)]
*  casualties. And that has been the fundamental problem. This was the great comforter in chief. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1542.44s)]
*  Joe Biden was supposed to be the empath. And yet, as Tony points out, what was so shocking in the [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1546.04s)]
*  film is he didn't even raise Shirin's case with Naftali Bennett, the prime minister of Israel at [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1550.36s)]
*  the time. Again, would he have done that if it was an American journalist in Moscow? We know that's [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1554.6799999999998s)]
*  not the case. We know when American journalists, especially white American journalists, are taken [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1559.56s)]
*  elsewhere in the world, the government gives a damn. And yet in the case of Shirin, the only [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1563.8799999999999s)]
*  explanation is because she was a Palestinian American journalist. You know, in the United [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1568.12s)]
*  States, the U.S. government is responsible for American citizens, which Biden pointed out at [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1572.52s)]
*  the beginning when he thought it was a Palestinian militant who had killed her. But, Lena, you yourself [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1577.96s)]
*  are a journalist, and I'm thinking I want to hear your response to using her face, because, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1583.48s)]
*  of course, that is not just the face of Shirin, but I think it's the face of journalism. And it's [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1590.28s)]
*  not just American journalism, of course. I mean, in fact, she's known to hundreds of millions of [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1596.1200000000001s)]
*  people around the world as the face and voice of Al Jazeera Arabic. She spoke in Arabic. She was [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1602.44s)]
*  known as that to the rest of the world. But to see that and that revealed in this documentary. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1609.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was horrifying, actually, and it just goes on to show how the Israeli military [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1618.12s)]
*  is built. It's barbarism. It's the character of revenge, of hate, and that is part of the entire [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1625.4s)]
*  system. And as Mahdi and as my father just mentioned, this is all about dehumanizing [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1638.2s)]
*  Palestinians, regardless if they're journalists, if they're doctors, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1645.24s)]
*  they're officials. For them, they simply don't care about Palestinian lives. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1649.8s)]
*  And for us, Shirin will always be the voice of Palestine, and she continues to be remembered [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1657.4s)]
*  for the legacy that she left behind. And she continues to live through so many journalists [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1664.6s)]
*  who have picked up the microphone, who have picked up the camera just because of Shirin. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1671.3999999999999s)]
*  So regardless of how the Israeli military continues to dehumanize journalists and how the U.S. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1678.4399999999998s)]
*  fails to protect Palestinian-American journalists, we will continue to push forward, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1685.7199999999998s)]
*  to continue to highlight the life and the legacy that Shirin left behind. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1691.8s)]
*  Well, let's turn to Shirin Abu Akhli in her own words. This is an excerpt from the Al Jazeera [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1697.6399999999999s)]
*  English documentary, The Killing of Shirin Abu Akhli. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1703.08s)]
*  Sometimes the Israeli army doesn't want you there, so they target you. Even if they later say it was [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1712.4399999999998s)]
*  an accident, they might say, we saw some young men around you, so they target you on purpose [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1717.64s)]
*  as a way of scaring you off because they don't want you there. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1724.1200000000001s)]
*  So that was Shirin in her own words in an Al Jazeera documentary. So, Lina, I know you have [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1727.4s)]
*  to go soon, but if you could just tell us, what do you want people to know about Shirin as an aunt, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1732.44s)]
*  a sister and a journalist? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1739.96s)]
*  Yes, so we know Shirin as the journalist, but behind the camera she was one of the most empathetic [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1744.6000000000001s)]
*  people. She was very sincere and something not a lot of people know, but she was a very funny person. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1750.3600000000001s)]
*  She had a very unique sense of humor that she lit up every room she entered. She cared about [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1757.96s)]
*  everyone and anyone. She enjoyed life. Shirin, at the end of the day, loved life. She had plans, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1763.56s)]
*  she had dreams that she still wanted to achieve, but her life was cut short by that small bullet, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1769.96s)]
*  which would change our lives entirely. But at the end of the day, Shirin was a professional journalist [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1776.36s)]
*  who always advocated for truth, for justice, and at the end of the day, all she wanted to do was [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1784.76s)]
*  humanize Palestinians and talk about the struggles of living under occupation. But at the same time, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1793.1599999999999s)]
*  she wanted to celebrate their achievements. She shed light on all the happy moments, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1800.12s)]
*  all the accomplishments of the Palestinian people, and this is something that really touched millions [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1805.24s)]
*  of Palestinians, of Arabs around the world. She was able to enter the hearts of the people [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1812.52s)]
*  through the small camera lens, and until this day, she continues to be remembered for that. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1819.08s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1826.92s)]
*  Before we go, we're going to keep you on, Mehdi, to talk about other issues during the Trump [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1828.12s)]

*  MEHDI MAHMUD So it's available online at whokilledshirin.com, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1840.28s)]

*  We hope that change that in the forthcoming days. People often say to me, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1850.28s)]
*  how could you put it behind a paywall? Journalism, free press isn't free, sadly. We have to fund [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1853.8799999999999s)]
*  films like this. Dayan came to us because a lot of other people didn't want to fund a topic like [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1858.6s)]
*  this, didn't want to fund an investigation like this. So we're proud to be able to fund such [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1862.84s)]
*  documentaries, but we also need support from our contributors, our subscribers and the viewers. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1866.44s)]
*  But it's an important film, and I hope as many people will watch it as possible, whokilledshirin.com. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7pe_p9spxc&t=1870.36s)]
