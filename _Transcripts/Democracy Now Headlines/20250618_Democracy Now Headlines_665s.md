Donald Trump has threatened to directly target Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and may be moving closer to ordering U.S. airstrikes on Iran. Meanwhile, Khamenei has rejected Trump's calls for "unconditional surrender," warning that Iran will meet any U.S. military action in Iran with "irreparable harm." In Tehran, many civilians have already evacuated after multiple Israeli strikes killed hundreds. "There's nothing sophisticated about slaughtering everyone in an apartment building to murder one or two people," says Mohammad Marandi about the strikes. Marandi, who has remained in Tehran, was part of the U.S.-Iran nuclear negotiations in 2015. He calls Trump's threat "an act of terror" but emphasizes that U.S. and Israeli vilification of Iran has "united the country more than ever before."

**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc)

*  In a televised address, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has rejected President [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  Trump's calls for unconditional surrender and warned Iran will meet any U.S. military [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=7.92s)]
*  action in Iran with, quote, irreparable harm. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=12.5s)]
*  Trump's directly threatened Khamenei by writing on Truth Social that the U.S. knows [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=16.84s)]
*  where he is, adding, quote, we are not going to take him out, at least not for now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=22.52s)]
*  This comes as multiple reports indicate Trump is moving closer to ordering U.S. airstrikes [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=28.76s)]
*  on Iran. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=33.7s)]
*  On Tuesday, he dismissed findings on Iran by his own intelligence agencies. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=34.94s)]
*  In March, the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, told lawmakers the intelligence [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  community, quote, continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, unquote. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=44.260000000000005s)]
*  On Tuesday, Trump dismissed Gabbard's testimony when asked about it by reporters. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=50.32s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard testified in March that the intelligence community said Iran wasn't [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=56.08s)]
*  building a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=60.92s)]
*  I don't hear what she said. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=61.92s)]
*  I think they were very close to having one. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=62.92s)]
*  This all comes as Israel is continuing to attack Iran for a sixth day, forcing thousands [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  of people to flee Tehran. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=72.16s)]
*  More than 50 Israeli warplanes struck targets inside Iran in the early hours of today. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=74.32s)]
*  Iran responded by firing ballistic missiles and launching drones at Israel, according [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=79.84s)]
*  to one count. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=84.28s)]
*  Israeli strikes since Friday have killed at least 585 people across Iran and wounded over [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=85.28s)]
*  1,300 others. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=90.28s)]
*  Iranian strikes on Israel have killed at least 23 people and injured over 630. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=93.0s)]
*  On Capitol Hill, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine called for his colleagues to support his War [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=98.4s)]
*  Powers Resolution to prevent a U.S. war with Iran. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=102.58s)]
*  I happen to believe that the United States engaging in a war against Iran, a third war [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=106.4s)]
*  in the Middle East since 2001, would be a catastrophic blunder for this country. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=113.36s)]
*  Meanwhile, there's a growing split within Trump's MAGA coalition over the prospect [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=120.83999999999999s)]
*  of the U.S. attacking Iran. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=125.44s)]
*  Conservative TV host Tucker Carlson has railed against what he's called warmongers within [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=127.36s)]
*  the Republican Party. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=132.04s)]
*  On Tuesday, video went viral of him interviewing the hawkish Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=133.64s)]
*  If you don't know anything about the country— [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=139.16s)]
*  I didn't say I don't know anything about the country. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=142.24s)]
*  OK, what's the ethnic mix of Iran? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=143.52s)]
*  They are Persians and predominantly Shia. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  OK, this is cute. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  No, no, it's not even—you don't know anything about Iran. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  So actually the country— [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=152.8s)]
*  OK, I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran who says— [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=153.8s)]
*  You're a senator who's calling for the overthrow of the government, and you don't [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=156.84s)]
*  know anything about the country. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=160.28s)]
*  For more, we're joined by two guests. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=162.28s)]
*  In Washington, D.C., Akbar Shahid Ahmed is the senior diplomatic correspondent for HuffPost, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  where his latest pieces are headlined, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=169.76s)]
*  Israel's War on Iran Bears the Echo of Past American Mistakes, and another article, the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=170.76s)]
*  pro-Israel U.S. general quietly influencing Trump on Iran. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=177.28s)]
*  But we begin in Tehran with Mohammed Marandi, professor of English Literature and Orientalism [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=183.4s)]
*  at the University of Tehran, part of the nuclear deal negotiations in 2015. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=188.28s)]
*  We welcome you both back to Democracy Now! [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=192.88s)]
*  Mohammed Marandi, let's begin with you. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=195.16s)]
*  You're in the capital of Iran, in Tehran, the capital where President Trump has said [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  everyone should leave. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=203.88s)]
*  Can you talk about what's happening? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=206.88s)]
*  Describe the scene on the ground. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=208.84s)]
*  How are people dealing? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=210.52s)]
*  Well, the administration here has facilitated people leaving Tehran since a few days ago. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=212.52s)]
*  Many government agencies are now allowing people to work from home or to take vacation. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=226.24s)]
*  And university and school exams have been canceled for now so that those who want to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=235.08s)]
*  leave the city can do so. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=240.36s)]
*  So Trump's warning, which is an act of terror, really didn't have a huge impact. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=242.4s)]
*  Many people had already left. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=252.44s)]
*  People like myself are here in Tehran. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=254.2s)]
*  Actually I'm in the Iranian National Television and Radio building, in one of the buildings [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  that's been evacuated. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=265.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm here because the internet is a bit better, is better than outside. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=267.2s)]
*  And as you know, the day before yesterday, they bombed the Iranian radio and television [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=272.24s)]
*  network and murdered a number of journalists. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=279.96s)]
*  And, Professor, we have all these reports of the targeted killings or assassinations [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=283.36s)]
*  of key leaders and scientists in Iran. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=294.92s)]
*  To what degree do you feel that this terror campaign of Israel has destabilized Iran's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=300.14s)]
*  top leadership? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=307.2s)]
*  Actually, these terror attacks have united the country more than ever before, or at least [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=310.48s)]
*  since, in my opinion, when Saddam Hussein invaded Iran. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=318.68s)]
*  Those assassinations were carried out during the first hours of this unprovoked attack. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=324.32s)]
*  And they bombed apartment blocks to get people. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=330.6s)]
*  They, for example, in one apartment block where they were seeking to murder one or two [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=335.64s)]
*  high-ranking military officials, they killed everyone, 65 people, including over 20 children. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=340.08s)]
*  So that was not—and Western media tries to celebrate this and to show how sophisticated [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  such an attack is. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=353.8s)]
*  It's not sophisticated. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=355.76s)]
*  My neighbors know where I am. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=356.76s)]
*  Their neighbors know that there's nothing sophisticated about slaughtering everyone [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=359.76s)]
*  in an apartment building to murder one or two people. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=365.96s)]
*  But that's, of course, what the Israeli regime has done across the board. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=370.8s)]
*  They destroy apartment blocks in Beirut. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=374.2s)]
*  And of course, Western media would call these Hezbollah targets in order to hide the crimes. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=378.03999999999996s)]
*  And we've seen what they've been doing in Gaza for 21 months, this genocide, this [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=382.92s)]
*  Holocaust, where they're slaughtering everyone everywhere. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=386.59999999999997s)]
*  So we shouldn't have any expectations for the Israeli regime to behave any different [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=389.76s)]
*  towards Iranians, because for them, we are all amic. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=394.04s)]
*  And also, I noticed that in the last day or so, the Iranian government has urged its people [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=400.8s)]
*  to delete social media platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=407.36s)]
*  The government claims that these platforms are relaying information to Israel, geolocation [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=413.24s)]
*  information about individual Iranians. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=419.36s)]
*  This prospect of these media companies actually participating or colluding with Israel, what's [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=424.04s)]
*  your sense of that? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=434.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=436.6s)]
*  Metta is actively participating in the attacks on Iran. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=437.6s)]
*  They are giving locations for academics, university professors. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=444.12s)]
*  I too, unfortunately, have WhatsApp. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=449.24s)]
*  I do not have Instagram. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=451.76s)]
*  My account was deleted by Instagram a long time ago. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=454.64s)]
*  But I only have WhatsApp because many journalists are trying to contact me, and I don't have [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=458.2s)]
*  any other means but to stay in contact with some of these people. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=465.91999999999996s)]
*  And of course, people have asked me to give up my cell phone. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=470.96s)]
*  But again, I have no option, because if I do, then I cannot conduct interviews. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=474.88s)]
*  So I have to take this risk. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=479.56s)]
*  But others are being encouraged to delete Instagram and to delete WhatsApp. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=481.11999999999995s)]
*  And I encourage people across the world to do so as well. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=488.84s)]
*  I wanted to get your response, Mohammed Marandi, to first the Iran's supreme leader, Ali [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=491.44s)]
*  Hamanid, rejecting Trump's calls for unconditional surrender, warning that Iran will meet any [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=499.48s)]
*  U.S. military action in Iran with irreparable harm, the significance of him speaking out [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=506.32s)]
*  and of Trump directly threatening him. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=514.88s)]
*  We followed this over a few days. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=516.8000000000001s)]
*  Trump has gone back and forth, U.S. officials saying that he stopped Netanyahu from targeting [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=518.9200000000001s)]
*  Ali Hamanid, but then threatening Ali Hamanid himself and ultimately, most recently, writing, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=526.6800000000001s)]
*  We are not going to take him out, at least not for now. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=532.4s)]
*  Can you talk about the significance of all of this and the U.S. fleet moving closer to [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=536.6s)]
*  the Middle East and Trump now apparently moving closer to getting directly involved, the whole [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=545.36s)]
*  issue of whether the U.S. would use something that they haven't yet given to Israel, which [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=552.24s)]
*  is a bunker buster bomb in Florida? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=556.5200000000001s)]
*  Well, Trump and Netanyahu are two sides at the same point. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=559.2800000000001s)]
*  They are both genocidal and they have no red lines. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=566.08s)]
*  And the Iranians, of course, will ignore their threats and continue to defend the country's [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=571.4000000000001s)]
*  sovereignty against this unprovoked aggression and this war that's been imposed upon us. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=578.4399999999999s)]
*  The Iranians have said very clearly that if the United States attacks, Iran will punish [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=586.88s)]
*  it severely. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuX4ADrMMWc&t=591.76s)]
