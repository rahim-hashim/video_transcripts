We speak with Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie, the co-directors of the Oscar-nominated documentary Sugarcane, which examines the legacy of Indian residential schools in Canada. For over 150 years, these government-funded and church-run boarding schools forcibly separated First Nations, Métis and Inuit children from their families in an effort to destroy Indigenous languages, cultures and communities. The schools were rife with physical, psychological and sexual abuse, and many children did not survive. In 2021, a First Nation in British Columbia found evidence of 215 child-sized graves on the grounds of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, setting off a nationwide search for more possible gravesites. Kassie and Brave NoiseCat would document the painful search for answers at Saint Joseph’s Mission, the residential school where Brave NoiseCat’s own relatives had been sent and near where his father was born and abandoned in a dumpster. The film explores “the colonial silence that exists in our broader society about this history” and how it has “seeped into the lives of the people who had survived it,” says Brave NoiseCat.

*  It's all names. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  When you're brought up in an institution like the Catholic Church, you have strict rules [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  and you went with their ethics. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=75.44s)]
*  I've been trying to find out what happened at St. Joseph's Mission. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=80.76s)]
*  Everything was so secretive. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  My dad was born there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=91.68s)]
*  How did it happen? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=96.28s)]
*  It's not something that you want to open up, you know. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  It just keeps on damaging. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=101.76s)]
*  For decades there were reports of neglect and children dying or disappearing from this [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=106.6s)]

*  Why are they dying? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=115.56s)]
*  Did they think we'd be stupid? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=116.56s)]
*  All of our lives, the rest of our lives, nobody would ever find out these things. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=117.56s)]
*  Being sorry for something is just the first step. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  You have to take action. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=138.67999999999998s)]
*  We see the impacts in our community every single day. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=140.67999999999998s)]

*  Your story is of someone who was abandoned, but also who abandoned. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=162.8s)]
*  You do know what happened with me, right? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=168.8s)]
*  I want to know the whole story. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=172.8s)]

*  Julian Brave Noisecat made history as the first indigenous filmmaker from North America [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  to be nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Documentary Feature category. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  His father is the only known survivor of the practice of infanticide at the St. Joseph's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=203.04000000000002s)]

*  And Emily Cassie is an award-winning filmmaker and investigative journalist. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=217.72s)]
*  We welcome you both to Democracy Now! [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=227.72s)]
*  I'm still reeling from watching your film last night on Hulu, from watching Sugarcane. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=230.72s)]
*  Julian, I want to begin with you as the son of a man who survived the practice of infanticide [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=238.72s)]
*  if that makes sense to people. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=247.4s)]
*  If you can talk about how you ended up joining Emily in this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=249.4s)]
*  At first, you weren't sure if you wanted to do this, but what it meant to focus on [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=253.4s)]
*  the St. Joseph's Mission. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=258.4s)]
*  Well, thank you so much for having me on again, Amy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=260.4s)]
*  It's always a pleasure to be on Democracy Now! [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=264.4s)]
*  We're incredibly proud of our film, Sugarcane. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=266.4s)]
*  It tells an untold and largely unknown story, especially here in the United States, about [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=268.4s)]
*  a system of attempted cultural genocide. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=275.08s)]
*  Six generations of Indigenous children forcibly separated from their families for over 150 [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=277.67999999999995s)]
*  years, and sent to segregated boarding schools where they were often abused and sometimes [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=283.67999999999995s)]
*  far worse happened. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=288.67999999999995s)]
*  Our film follows an investigation at one of those schools, St. Joseph's Mission, near [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=290.67999999999995s)]
*  Williams Lake, British Columbia, Canada. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=295.08s)]
*  It happens to be the school that my family was sent to. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=297.08s)]
*  But when I first actually discussed the possibility of working on a documentary on this subject [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=300.76s)]
*  with Emily, it was just generally about Indian residential schools. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=307.76s)]
*  And this really crazy thing happened, which you can read a little bit more about in the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=311.76s)]
*  New York Times, where I told her I'd have to think about being able to work on a film [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=315.76s)]
*  on that subject at all because it was such a personal and heavy subject. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=320.76s)]
*  She went off and found First Nation that was going to begin its own investigation. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=324.76s)]
*  And so I circled back around to tell her that I was open to collaborating with her. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=329.44s)]
*  She told me that the investigation that she'd secured access to follow was at St. Joseph's [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=332.44s)]
*  Mission, which as you might imagine was a really crazy, but shared Kismet moment because [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=338.44s)]
*  of course that's the school that my family was sent to and where my father was born. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=345.44s)]
*  And in telling this story, of course, we're telling a personal and familial story, but [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=349.44s)]
*  we're also trying to tell a story that's representative of the experience of an entire [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=354.44s)]
*  in North America. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=359.12s)]
*  And and Julian, did the members of your family ever talk about their experiences? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=361.32s)]
*  Could you talk about what you what you learned growing up? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=366.04s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I did not grow up on the Canham Lake Indian Reserve, which is the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=371.32s)]
*  reservation that my family comes from, but I spent a lot of summers and holidays going [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=375.48s)]
*  back when I was in college. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=379.76s)]
*  I actually lived there over the summers and spent my time learning sequet mochchin, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=381.92s)]
*  which is our language. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=387.35999999999996s)]
*  It was a language that was actually nearly wiped out by St. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=388.91999999999996s)]
*  Joseph's Mission and the Indian Residential Schools. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=392.32s)]
*  And I learned that language from my Ki'a, who is one of the participants in our [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=394.91999999999996s)]
*  documentary. And if you're learning a language from your grandmother, that's what [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=398.28s)]
*  Ki'a means, you know, who was sent to one of these schools and who nearly lost that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  language because of them. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, you're you might ask questions about what happened at those schools. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=408.36s)]
*  And from the little bit that I had heard from her, which was essentially a couple of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  stories, one about how she was not supposed to be sent at all. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=417.64s)]
*  And her family tried to hide her in a cabin in the woods and another about how at the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=420.91999999999996s)]
*  school, you know, they would call the priests and nuns can Kecknam, meaning the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  black bear, because not only they wore black, but because they were also predators. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=431.2s)]
*  You know, I really got the understanding that this was a very painful experience, one [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  that she was not comfortable speaking about at all and one wherein the silence, the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=441.12s)]
*  colonial silence that exists in our broader society about this history, you know, also [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=446.52s)]
*  had seeped into the lives of the people who had survived it, who were suppressing some [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=452.2s)]
*  often very painful memories and that that was a very significant part of our [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=457.96s)]
*  intergenerational trauma as indigenous peoples. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=463.24s)]
*  Julian, before we also bring Emily into this conversation, I said in the lead that your [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=466.64s)]
*  father was the only known survivor of the practice of infanticide. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=473.4s)]
*  Can you describe how he was found as an infant? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=478.16s)]
*  So my father was born at or near St. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=485.16s)]
*  Joseph's Mission near Williams Lake, British Columbia. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=488.68s)]
*  Our understanding is that he was likely born in the fourth floor of the dormitories there. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=492.16s)]
*  My grandmother was a student at that school, but by the time my father was born, she was [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=496.68s)]
*  20 years old. She'd actually just started as a nurse in the nearby settlement of Williams [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=502.84s)]
*  Lake. He was discarded into a garbage burner, a trash incinerator at the school after he [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=508.44s)]
*  was born under circumstances that we still do not fully understand, though logic would [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=518.64s)]
*  tell you that it would be impossible for someone who just delivered a baby to get up [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=524.84s)]
*  and walk that baby to, you know, a garbage burner. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=529.8000000000001s)]
*  So there is a question of who else might have been present. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=533.08s)]
*  And about 20 minutes or so later, give or take, he was discovered by a man named Antony [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=536.96s)]
*  Stoop, who was a Dutchman from the old country who worked at the school. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=543.4s)]
*  He's sometimes described as a dairyman in sources, other other times as the night [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  watchman. And very notably, given that my last name is Noise Cat, his his [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=552.6s)]
*  cries for for life were described by Tony Stoop as sounding like the noise of that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=560.32s)]
*  So it was a very, you know, it's a it's a it's a very crazy, somewhat spiritual, but [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=568.48s)]
*  also it's a story about not just what the schools did to native people, but then how [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  that colonial oppression then shaped our relationships to ourselves and some of the [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=581.88s)]
*  ways that we internalized and perpetuated that abuse across generations and that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=586.88s)]
*  abandonment across generations, which is also something that impact impacted my own [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=593.56s)]
*  life as you see in Sugar Kill. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=597.92s)]
*  I'd like to bring out Emily Cassie into the conversation. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=600.8s)]
*  Emily, you've covered human rights abuses globally from Afghanistan to Niger. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=603.92s)]
*  What drew you to investigate the legacy of Canada's residential schools? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=609.6s)]
*  Yeah, so I, you know, I have done this work and sought to understand why we exact [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=615.88s)]
*  violence on one another. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=622.36s)]
*  That comes from my own family history and community growing up amongst Holocaust [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=624.0s)]
*  survivors and their descendants. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=629.48s)]
*  And I heard about the unmarked graves in May of 2021, and I realized in that moment [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=632.4s)]
*  that I had looked for these answers all around the world, but I had never looked in [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=639.0s)]
*  my own backyard at what had happened and the genocide that was perpetrated in my [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=643.52s)]
*  own country. I was born and raised in Toronto. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=648.56s)]
*  The last year of the residential schools was in 1997, which was my first year of [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=650.8s)]
*  kindergarten. And yet we were taught nothing about it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=655.56s)]
*  I knew virtually nothing until I had become a journalist and a filmmaker and had [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=658.64s)]
*  learned a little bit. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=664.72s)]
*  So when that news broke, I felt this kind of gut pull to the story. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=666.28s)]
*  And there were two things I did that day. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=670.48s)]
*  One was reach out to Julian. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=672.9200000000001s)]
*  Jules and I had worked our first reporting jobs together almost a decade ago. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=674.52s)]
*  We had been randomly sat at the desks next to each other and he had gone on to become a [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=679.28s)]
*  very prolific writer and journalist looking at indigenous life in North America. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=683.36s)]
*  And when he told me he'd think about it, I went looking for a nation that was going to do a [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=688.28s)]
*  search. And I happened to find this article in the Williams Lake Tribune about Chief Willie [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=691.72s)]
*  Sellers. And I wrote him a cold email and Chief Sellers called me back and he said, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=695.16s)]
*  The creator has always had great timing. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=699.8s)]
*  Just yesterday, our counsel said we need someone to document our search. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=701.7199999999999s)]
*  Of course, as Julian said, little did I know that I had ended up selecting the very [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=706.1999999999999s)]
*  school where Julian's family attended and where his father's life began out of those 139 in [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=710.64s)]
*  Canada and 417 in the United States. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=715.7199999999999s)]
*  I wanted to go back to 2022 when Pope Francis made a historic trip to Canada to apologize for the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=720.36s)]
*  mistreatment suffered by indigenous children in residential schools run by the Catholic Church. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=729.0s)]
*  I myself wish to reaffirm this with shame and unambiguously humbly beg forgiveness for the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=737.9599999999999s)]
*  evil committed by so many Christians against the indigenous peoples. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=744.12s)]
*  Can you, Julian, talk about the significance of this moment? Now the pope lays in hospital, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=747.56s)]
*  is very, very sick. But what happened there? And also Prime Minister Trudeau, what this means and [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=755.16s)]
*  what kind of reparations are being made, if that's at all possible? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=764.52s)]
*  In Sugarcane, we have a political diptych close to the sort of crescendo in the narrative where [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=768.92s)]
*  first you see the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, visit the Williams Lake First Nation and [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=776.28s)]
*  issue his own sort of preemptive apology to beat the pope to the punch, which is, just as an aside, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=782.4399999999999s)]
*  a very Canadian, liberal Canadian thing to do, to be the first one to say sorry. And we hope that our [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=789.0s)]
*  viewers sort of understand the humor in that, even though it's obviously a very serious subject. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=794.68s)]
*  And then we follow a survivor of St. Joseph's Mission, the late Chief Rick Gilbert, to the [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=801.0s)]
*  Vatican, where he attends the papal apology to survivors of Indian residential schools in Canada. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=807.16s)]
*  And Emily actually had to sneak into the Vatican to record that because the Catholic Church [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=814.52s)]
*  even when it comes to apologies, kind of shockingly, is still incredibly controlling as to what narratives it allows to be [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=821.56s)]
*  told about itself and its actions. And in that moment, the pope actually chose to deliver that apology [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=829.56s)]
*  in Italian. So many of the attendees themselves, still faithful Catholics, despite everything [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=836.6s)]
*  that happened to them at these schools, actually were not able to really process and understand [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=845.88s)]
*  the apology that was being given to them in that moment, which I think in the film and in broader society [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=852.6s)]
*  should beg the question of what would it actually mean to apologize and what would that mean in a truly [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=859.08s)]
*  Catholic sense of atonement? Our film, while it takes on the wrongs of the Catholic Church, also [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=867.5600000000001s)]
*  I think is quite even-handed in portraying the way that our elders, in particular in my community, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=873.4000000000001s)]
*  remain committed to the Catholic Church and actually often survived some of the abuses they suffered at the hands [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=880.44s)]
*  of representatives of that faith with a rosary in their hand by praying and praying for the Lord [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=887.24s)]
*  with a rosary in their hand by praying to God and Jesus and the Great Spirit [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=894.28s)]
*  in the way that they learned at the schools, which I think is a very complicated part of this history [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=902.4399999999999s)]
*  that I think is also very human. I think we remain attached to things that sometimes also harm us. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=909.3199999999999s)]
*  I'll just add as well that this moment was there was a real feeling of emptiness in the room. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=915.0s)]
*  The apologies mean something to some people and that matters. Of course, the film was part of [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=921.08s)]
*  Joe Biden's historic apology as well, but it's not nearly enough. The Catholic Church has refused to [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=927.24s)]
*  open their records to Indigenous communities so that their survivors can at least know the truth. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=934.2s)]
*  That's the same with the U.S. and Canadian government. Of course, the Catholic Church [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=939.72s)]
*  apologized for the actions of individuals, not the actual institution, which moved priests around [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=944.5200000000001s)]
*  as they knew they were abusing them. Though Julian's father was the only known survivor [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=952.2s)]
*  of the Incinerator, we know that there were a lot more babies at St. Joseph's Mission, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=956.6800000000001s)]
*  potentially other schools who were either adopted out into white families after being many of them [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=960.5200000000001s)]
*  born to priests, like the late chief Rick Gilbert. His father was the principal of the school. That's [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=966.36s)]
*  the individual that we followed to the Vatican. He was carrying that dark secret in his very own [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=973.08s)]
*  DNA. And other babies we know were also found in the school's Incinerator babies who were born at [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=978.12s)]
*  the school. So this is a pattern that was insidious, and those harms have never been acknowledged by [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=984.44s)]
*  the Catholic Church. And the Catholic Church has not acknowledged the film or what was uncovered [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=991.4000000000001s)]
*  for the first time in it. We just have 20 seconds, but Julian and Emily have just come from the [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=995.32s)]
*  Academy Awards ceremony. Julian, how did it feel to make history as the first [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=1001.88s)]
*  indigenous filmmaker from North America to be nominated in the documentary category? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=1008.76s)]
*  In any category, actually. Yeah. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=1014.92s)]
*  Yeah, it was really beautiful, you know, to see in particular my father, my Auntie Charlene, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=1018.28s)]
*  who's in the film, Chief Willie also in the film on the red carpet. You know, it just signified that [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=1022.76s)]
*  we had had something really special here in this film and that the broader world was getting an [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=1028.52s)]
*  opportunity to see that. And, you know, we wanted to give Indian country a reason to hold their [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=1033.32s)]
*  heads high. And I think we did. Well, you certainly did. Julian, Brave Noise Cat and Emily Cassie, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=1038.2s)]
*  you did such an incredible job. It is an unforgettable documentary, co-directors [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=1044.92s)]
*  of the Oscar nominated film Sugarcane. We'll link to Julian's piece in the New York Times [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=1051.24s)]
*  headlined, I told a native story that earned an Oscar nomination. There are so many more to tell. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TZMu35E2xc&t=1056.76s)]
