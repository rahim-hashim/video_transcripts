*  for criticism of Israel's assault on Gaza. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=69.92s)]
*  The U.S. government has made clear they will use immigration enforcement as a tool to suppress [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=73.2s)]
*  that speech, unquote. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=78.58s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil was a key organizer of the Columbia Encampment. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=81.04s)]
*  This is Mahmoud speaking on campus in April. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=85.08s)]
*  This encampment is a minor inconvenience compared to the generational shaping events taking [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=88.8s)]
*  place now in Gaza. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=95.92s)]
*  Throughout the negotiations, the Shafi'i administration treated this movement as a matter of internal [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=98.28s)]
*  student discipline rather than a movement—rather than as one of the great moral and political [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=105.28s)]
*  questions of this generation. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=112.92s)]
*  Columbia's short-sighted political decision, making today in the face of a genocide that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=115.8s)]
*  has stolen the lives of over 34,000 human beings—women, men, babies in Gaza—that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=122.28s)]
*  has destroyed lineages and heritage sites and universities will be a stain on its legacy [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=129.28s)]
*  forever. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=135.68s)]
*  The students on this encampment are a gift to Columbia. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=136.68s)]
*  We offer to give the university back its principles. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=141.76s)]
*  With all eyes on Columbia, the administration could have chosen to divest in a manner that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=146.0s)]
*  aligns with its past. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=151.44s)]
*  Columbia would rather trample its reputation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=154.48s)]
*  Instead of being proud of its students and faculty for raising these incredibly important [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  moral questions, we have been hit with little more than threats and petty attacks. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=163.04s)]
*  This is not a matter of simply violating university rules. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=169.48s)]
*  This is a movement, an antiwar movement. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=173.28s)]
*  We have sparked similar Gaza solidarity encampments across the nation and even across the globe. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  So, that was Mahmoud Khalil speaking in April at the Gaza Solidarity Encampment at Columbia [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  University. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  He was detained by ICE on Saturday. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  On Sunday night, Secretary of State Marco Rubio shared an article about Khalil and wrote [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=195.3s)]
*  on X, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  We'll be revoking the visas under green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=200.98000000000002s)]
*  can be deported." [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=205.5s)]
*  Khalil's arrest came as the Trump administration withdrew $400 million in federal grants and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=206.5s)]
*  contracts to Columbia University for failing to stop, quote, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=214.38000000000002s)]
*  anti-Semitic harassment at its campus. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=218.3s)]
*  In fact, Columbia repeatedly targeted Palestinian rights protesters, many of them Jewish, and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=221.9s)]
*  called in police to crack down on the peaceful student movement. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=228.62s)]
*  We're joined now by two guests. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=232.54000000000002s)]
*  Prem Thacker is political correspondent and columnist for Zateo News. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=235.02s)]
*  He's also a Columbia graduate. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=239.58s)]
*  His most recent piece, DHS Detains Palestinian Students from Columbia Encampment Advocates, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=242.42000000000002s)]
*  say. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=247.5s)]
*  We're also joined by Joseph Howley, an associate professor of classics at Columbia University. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=248.5s)]
*  Professor Howley, let's begin with you. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=255.62s)]
*  Can you explain what happened to Mahmoud Khalil on Saturday? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=257.1s)]
*  Where was he? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=264.94s)]
*  How was he taken? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=266.1s)]
*  And how is it possible he was taken, given that he has a green card? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=267.58s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of questions in there we don't know the answers to. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=271.78s)]
*  And everything I know about what happened to Mahmoud comes from his lawyer and his family, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=276.78000000000003s)]
*  because we've still received no communication from the university. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=280.62s)]
*  Our understanding is that he and his wife, who is a U.S. citizen who's eight months [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=283.7s)]
*  pregnant, were returning home here in the neighborhood, and that plainclothes DHS agents [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=287.58s)]
*  forced their way into their home behind them, told Mahmoud that his student visa had been [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=292.86s)]
*  revoked when it was explained that he had a green card. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=298.42s)]
*  They seemed confused, got on the phone with someone, declared that the green card had [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=301.5s)]
*  also been revoked. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=305.3s)]
*  Mahmoud's lawyer got on the phone with them, demanded to see the warrant, and they hung [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=306.98s)]
*  up and they took him off. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=310.46s)]
*  And no one was able to find him, you know, I think for at least 24 hours. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=312.86s)]
*  And can you talk about what people's response is right now, staff, students, around Columbia, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=319.06s)]
*  how people are organizing? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=329.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, this is something that I think is very frightening for a lot of members of our community. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=332.26s)]
*  I have colleagues and students, you know, messaging me since yesterday asking about [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=337.46000000000004s)]
*  whether it's safe to be on campus, asking about canceling classes or taking classes [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=345.86s)]
*  remote, because they don't know how safe it is to be on or around campus with ICE agents [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=350.74s)]
*  prowling the neighborhood. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=356.42s)]
*  And, you know, we have a lot of members of our community who are on student visas. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=358.02s)]
*  We have a lot of members of our community who are permanent residents. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=361.54s)]
*  And so I think people are wondering now, you know, how is it safe to be here on campus? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=365.18s)]
*  And can you talk about the atmosphere on campus? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=373.34s)]
*  Well, campus has been under a security lockdown since last April, since before the first Gaza [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=378.65999999999997s)]
*  Solidarity encampment went up. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=384.62s)]
*  So walking into campus this morning, things were very quiet. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=386.58s)]
*  But they're always very quiet now. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=390.09999999999997s)]
*  They've been quiet for months and months. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=391.58s)]
*  It feels like we're under, you know, a heavy security regimen. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=394.78s)]
*  What are you calling for? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=400.34s)]
*  And can you talk about your criticism of the Columbia campus around the issue of the pro-Palestinian [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=401.62s)]
*  protests that took place all last year, how Columbia dealt with it? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=409.02s)]
*  Ultimately, you have the president, Manu Shafik, leaving. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=414.34000000000003s)]
*  The president had called in police over and over again. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=418.74s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=422.74s)]
*  Look, for the last year, a number of my colleagues and I have been trying to make the point to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=423.74s)]
*  university leadership, to our colleagues, that these attacks on the Palestine solidarity [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=429.14s)]
*  movement as somehow inherently anti-Semitic, or the idea that the presence of the solidarity [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=434.1s)]
*  movement poses a threat to all Jewish students on campus are very dangerous lies and bad [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=440.12s)]
*  faith attacks on higher education that we really should be engaging with as threats [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=446.12s)]
*  rather than as sincere complaints. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=451.6s)]
*  So we wrote a letter to former president Shafik last spring that we published. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=453.20000000000005s)]
*  We've written a few other letters and statements since then. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=458.56s)]
*  And the point is really this. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  We know that the political right in this country hates higher education and wants to destroy [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=462.48s)]
*  it or remake it in its own image. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=466.8s)]
*  We've seen this in the public education system in places like Florida and North Carolina. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=468.48s)]
*  And it's been very clear to anyone who's watching since last spring that this issue is being [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=473.2s)]
*  used as a wedge. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  But now what we can see is that everyone who spent the year pointing to anyone with a [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=478.8s)]
*  kaffir and yelling Hamas, pointing to anyone with a Palestinian flag and calling them a [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=483.48s)]
*  terrorist, everyone who spent the last year going on the public record and saying that [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=488.44s)]
*  has some sort of uniform cultural widespread problem with anti-Semitism has been, you know, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=494.20000000000005s)]
*  loading the gun for the Trump administration to do what they always wanted to do, which [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=500.76000000000005s)]
*  is cripple major institutions of learning in this country. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=504.68s)]
*  Professor Hawley, if you could talk about the criticism that what's going on on campus [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=509.44000000000005s)]
*  is anti-Semitic. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=517.72s)]
*  In fact, are you yourself Jewish? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=518.9200000000001s)]
*  I am Jewish. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=521.9200000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I don't really like playing that card, but it's become very important [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=522.9200000000001s)]
*  for those of us who are Jewish and do not subscribe to the idea that the presence of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=526.64s)]
*  this protest movement is anti-Semitic to stand up and say so. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=530.48s)]
*  But look, we do have problems with, you know, harassment and bias towards Jewish students. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=534.24s)]
*  We have problems with harassment and bias towards Muslim, Arab and Palestinian students. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=539.12s)]
*  Every time Israel goes on a new killing spree in the occupied Palestinian territories, anti-Semitism [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=543.64s)]
*  surges around the world. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=549.0s)]
*  Every time, you know, Hamas kills hundreds of people, we have to deal with attacks on [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=551.3199999999999s)]
*  Muslims and Arabs. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=554.96s)]
*  We have a widespread climate problem here because this is an international campus. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=557.28s)]
*  But you know, using the ADL's playbook under the guise of protecting Jewish students to [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=562.1999999999999s)]
*  suppress the protest movement has not been making anyone safer. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=567.0s)]
*  Can you talk about what has happened now and if you believe other students have been taken [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=573.6s)]
*  by ICE? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=579.16s)]
*  You know, we don't have a lot of information about this. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=581.16s)]
*  My understanding is that on Friday, not long after the federal government announced the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=584.36s)]
*  funding freeze, that ICE agents tried to gain access to another student residence. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=588.28s)]
*  We don't know yet, or I don't know yet if anyone else has been detained at this point, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=593.68s)]
*  but you know, I've been hearing from students in the last 24 hours that there are rumors [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=598.68s)]
*  or reports of more ICE activity in the neighborhood today and we haven't gotten anything from [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=603.06s)]
*  the university administration about any of this except to say that Columbia follows the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=608.6s)]
*  law. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=612.76s)]
*  And your response to this happening at the same time, your university, Columbia, now [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=613.76s)]
*  the federal government is cutting off $400 million to the university. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=620.16s)]
*  We just had a segment on the attack on science. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=626.92s)]
*  We're talking about across the board in Columbia, right? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=630.16s)]
*  Basic scientific research and beyond. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=636.28s)]
*  It's going to be devastating. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=638.04s)]
*  I mean, it's, you know, experiments are going to languish. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=639.04s)]
*  People are going to lose their jobs. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=642.24s)]
*  Labs are going to get shut down. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=643.24s)]
*  And of course, it's not just about the war on science. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=645.8399999999999s)]
*  It's about the war on higher education. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=647.8s)]
*  But I think the crucial thing to pay attention to here is that the cover that the White House [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=649.68s)]
*  is using for this is this claim that Columbia has done nothing to address this rampant climate [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=655.04s)]
*  of anti-Semitism. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=659.4399999999999s)]
*  I've already told you I would dispute that characterization of the climate on campus, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=660.4399999999999s)]
*  but it's also clear that the university has done a great deal about this. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=664.44s)]
*  We have, you know, a large new Office of Inclusion and Equity that's been investigating every [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=668.04s)]
*  conceivable complaint of anti-Semitism, including some that seem really kind of spurious or [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=673.36s)]
*  excessive. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=678.36s)]
*  I think it's outrageous that we should be taking lectures from a White House on anti-Semitism, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=679.36s)]
*  a White House that's probably the most anti-Semitic administration in American history. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=684.12s)]
*  And I think it's preposterous that we as an institution should try to bargain or engage [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=688.28s)]
*  in good faith on the question of anti-Semitism with, you know, neo-Nazis and segregationists [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=692.94s)]
*  and great replacement theorists. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=699.14s)]
*  Like, I'm old enough to remember when Donald Trump supporters marched through the campus [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=700.7s)]
*  of the University of Virginia chanting, Jews will not replace us. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=704.66s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember when the Republican Party's xenophobic propaganda about migrants [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=707.62s)]
*  convinced someone to shoot up the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=713.66s)]
*  This is not a political movement that cares about keeping Jews or anyone else safe. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=717.64s)]
*  This is a political movement that is willing to instrumentalize the fear and confusion [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=722.5s)]
*  of Jews to crush any kind of dissent in this country and to break higher education. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=726.54s)]
*  Can you also talk about Columbia and Barnard expelling student protesters? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=731.5s)]
*  The Nation magazine recently noted, according to the group Columbia University Apartheid [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=735.18s)]
*  Divest, the last expulsion for nonviolent political protest at the school was in 1936, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=739.38s)]
*  when Robert Burke was expelled for rallying against Columbia's ties to Nazism. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=746.66s)]
*  Yeah, so Barnard had recently expelled two students only a couple of weeks after they [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=752.9399999999999s)]
*  allegedly participated in a classroom disruption here on Columbia's campus. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=758.98s)]
*  And I think it's pretty clear to everyone that expulsion is an incredibly drastic response [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=763.86s)]
*  to any kind of infraction here, especially one that amounts to, you know, a speech violation. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=769.14s)]
*  My colleagues at Barnard tell me this expulsion was done without anything like due process, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=775.0s)]
*  that the disciplinary process and oversight by faculty over there is really in shambles. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=778.88s)]
*  I think the important thing to remember here is that these are institutions of learning. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=783.8000000000001s)]
*  And when we expel students summarily, we deprive ourselves of the opportunity to help them learn. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=787.9200000000001s)]
*  So I don't know what anyone thinks expelling students is going to achieve except appeasing [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=793.4000000000001s)]
*  the right wingers in DC, but I think we can see that there's actually no amount of discipline [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=798.84s)]
*  or suppression that will appease them because they don't really care about anti-Semitism [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=803.6s)]
*  or keeping Jews safe. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=808.08s)]
*  All they care about is crushing dissent. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=809.48s)]
*  And do you think this is just about the pro-Palestinian protests? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=811.32s)]
*  I mean, as we move forward, the message being sent around protests on campus, Professor? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=814.32s)]
*  Yeah, look, this is—I mean, you remember what the backlash was like after the uprising [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=820.5600000000001s)]
*  in 2020, after the killing of George Floyd, right? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=825.88s)]
*  This is in part about whether we're going to be allowed to have mass protest movements [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=828.14s)]
*  whether we're going to be allowed to have youth protest movements and student protest [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=832.72s)]
*  movements. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=836.2s)]
*  And my colleagues and I have been saying for a year now that one reason we need to stand [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=837.2s)]
*  up better to bad faith lies about the Palestine Solidarity Movement is that this is about [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=841.24s)]
*  establishing a precedent for imposing speech codes on higher education and on American [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=847.08s)]
*  society generally. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=852.4s)]
*  So right now it's Palestine. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=853.6800000000001s)]
*  Next it's going to be race or gender or trans rights or climate. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=855.5600000000001s)]
*  We are also joined in addition to Professor Joseph Howley by Prim Tucker. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=860.4000000000001s)]
*  He is a political correspondent, columnist for Zeteo News. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=865.5600000000001s)]
*  You've been reporting extensively on the ICE raid and the home of this Columbia, former [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=869.12s)]
*  Columbia graduate student. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=877.7600000000001s)]
*  Talk more about what you know, how they're justifying the green card holder having his [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=879.8000000000001s)]
*  green card revoked and now his eight-month pregnant wife is not able to find out where [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=886.12s)]
*  he is, let alone anyone else, including his lawyer. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=892.44s)]
*  Thank you, Amy. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=896.08s)]
*  Thank you, Professor. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=898.28s)]
*  Yes, I think one thing that's really worth underscoring here is just how clumsy and haphazard [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=899.64s)]
*  this attempt by the administration has been to detain Mahmoud and to subsequently revoke [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=905.44s)]
*  his green card. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=909.96s)]
*  First of all, as the professor said, these agents forced themselves into this apartment [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=910.96s)]
*  building, did not necessarily apparently introduce themselves, demanded to see their identification, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=915.2800000000001s)]
*  Mahmoud and his wife. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=920.72s)]
*  And they first chose to tell him that they were revoking his visa, that the State Department [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=922.44s)]
*  was revoking his visa upon them being told that, in fact, Mahmoud had a green card. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=929.12s)]
*  They were on the phone. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=933.72s)]
*  They said, oh, actually, you know, the green card's revoked as well. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=934.72s)]
*  And so that was the basis for the subsequent way in which this has been seen, which is [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=937.0s)]
*  that the administration has been very lackluster in their explanation for how this is justified [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=942.32s)]
*  at all. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=949.2800000000001s)]
*  First, the shadowy arrest and detention at all, the fact that it's unclear where Mahmoud [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=950.2800000000001s)]
*  is right now. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=954.72s)]
*  I can sort of break some potential possible news right now that it seems, based on internal [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=955.72s)]
*  ICE detaining tracking, that Mahmoud appears to be in Louisiana, as was feared. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=960.96s)]
*  That is not confirmed, but that is what we are seeing from the ICE detention tracker, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=967.0s)]
*  which can sometimes be delayed or lagged. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=972.0799999999999s)]
*  But that is something to keep in mind, that Mahmoud, who was detained in New York City, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=973.68s)]
*  is 36 hours later already possibly in Louisiana. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=978.3199999999999s)]
*  So there's that aspect, the shadowy aspect of this. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=983.04s)]
*  There's also the aspect that the administration doesn't seem to know exactly how to justify [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=985.0799999999999s)]
*  this very haphazard unilateral move and is trying to appeal to simply President Trump's [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=990.12s)]
*  executive orders rather than things like the Constitution or case law or legal precedent. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=995.48s)]
*  You have Marco Rubio, as mentioned, saying that they will be revoking not just visa cards, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1001.72s)]
*  but also ANS-slash-OR green cards, which is very much beyond his sort of stated authority, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1007.68s)]
*  his jurisdiction. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1012.88s)]
*  There is some—there is one individual law that gives him wide authority to do so, but [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1013.88s)]
*  this would require Marco Rubio personally interfering on foreign policy grounds to justify [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1019.16s)]
*  such a deportation. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1024.8799999999999s)]
*  And so, I think you're going to see a lot of not just moral pushback, but legal pushback [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1026.32s)]
*  against something that is just so haphazard, so reckless and so unjustifiable in so many [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1030.72s)]
*  different ways. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1036.16s)]
*  And what do you understand about the university, Columbia University? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1037.16s)]
*  How much are they or are they resisting this pressure from the administration or even the [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1041.72s)]
*  arrest of Mahmoud? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1047.52s)]
*  So we had asked the university pretty early on about, you know, sort of their awareness [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1052.16s)]
*  of ICE and DHS activity on campus during and before this detention, if they had shared [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1057.86s)]
*  any student information or campus affiliate information with authorities. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1062.8999999999999s)]
*  And they chose not to answer those questions. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1067.7s)]
*  They directed us to this broader statement regarding guidance that they had sort of coincidentally [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1069.26s)]
*  issued to campus affiliates just before this had happened about what affiliates should [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1075.7s)]
*  do if they see ICE or DHS activity on campus. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1080.46s)]
*  So beyond the sort of suspect or interesting timing, what's interesting is that in this [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1084.38s)]
*  guidance, it's sort of contrast as to how the university sort of operated in 2016 during [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1089.38s)]
*  Trump's first term, while the school was led by a First Amendment scholar and Columbia [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1098.1000000000001s)]
*  president Lee Bollinger, in which they were much more firm in saying that they wouldn't [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1102.3400000000001s)]
*  allow immigration authorities to be on campus without a warrant, that they wouldn't share [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1107.18s)]
*  information with authorities unless they were ordered by court or subpoenaed. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1111.9s)]
*  Whereas in this new guidance, they sort of have this more open tolerance or idea to the [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1115.5s)]
*  idea that DHS or ICE agents might need to access buildings even without a warrant and [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1119.6200000000001s)]
*  that campus affiliates, quote, should not interfere if that's the case under sort [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1125.58s)]
*  of exigent circumstances, as the school calls them. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1130.38s)]
*  And so there's already this sort of shifting in rhetoric from Trump in his first term to [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1133.42s)]
*  Trump in his second term from the Columbia's point of view. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1138.22s)]
*  And you can see that manifesting in what we've seen this weekend and, as the professor has [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1142.58s)]
*  said, with reports of more ICE and DHS presence even up to today. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1146.18s)]
*  And Prem Tuckar, the firing of, the forcing out of the professor, law professor, Katherine [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1150.98s)]
*  Frankel, we just have 30 seconds, this also coming within this period. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1156.94s)]
*  She was a law professor for almost a quarter of a century at Columbia. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1162.02s)]
*  Yes, yes, absolutely. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1167.7s)]
*  And I believe the firing of Professor Katherine Frankel, you can see more about that in our [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1169.3799999999999s)]
*  Zateo Town Hall today with her, actually. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1173.54s)]
*  She is amongst an array of sort of victims, people caught up in the crossfire of being [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1175.8s)]
*  targeted, as Professor Hawley said, for this right-wing attack on academic freedom, on [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1181.3s)]
*  institutions, on free speech, on the ability for professors to advocate for their students [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1185.7s)]
*  to express their own free speech rights, to speak out against war, to speak out on behalf [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1189.6s)]
*  of Palestinians. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1193.76s)]
*  This is only a sort of broader sort of warning sign of what's to come if there is not an [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1195.3799999999999s)]
*  organized, coherent opposition to this. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1201.22s)]
*  We're going to have to leave it there. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1204.26s)]
*  Prem Tuckar, I want to thank you so much for being with us, political correspondent, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1205.58s)]
*  comments for Zateo, a link to your articles, and Professor Hawley. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1208.58s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwj1HBqBi7s&t=1212.8999999999999s)]
