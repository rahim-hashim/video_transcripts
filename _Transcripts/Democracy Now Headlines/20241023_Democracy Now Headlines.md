# Top U.S. & World Headlines — October 23, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0ikQY23Rk)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel's leading human rights group, Petzalim, has accused the Israeli military of committing
*  ethnic cleansing in northern Gaza, as its devastating siege continues for a 19th day.
*  In the Jabalya refugee camp, Israeli forces stormed at least three schools sheltering
*  forcing those inside to leave at gunpoint before setting fire to the buildings.
*  Palestinians fleeing the shattered remains of Beit Lachia report seeing bodies in the
*  streets and Israeli soldiers detaining and beating men.
*  The stench of death is everywhere.
*  This comes as United Nations report published Tuesday found one year of Israeli attacks
*  on Gaza has set back the territory's economic development nearly seven decades, plunging
*  three of every four surviving Palestinians into poverty, with Israeli strikes and civilian
*  infrastructure leaving behind a, quote,
*  "'vast wasteland of rubble and twisted steel.'"
*  unquote.
*  The U.N. warns Palestinians under Israeli siege in northern Gaza, quote,
*  "'are rapidly exhausting all available means for their survival.'"
*  unquote.
*  Israel's intensifying its attacks on Lebanon.
*  Earlier today, Israel bombed the historic Lebanese port city of Tyre, one of the oldest
*  cities in the world, after ordering residents to leave their homes and businesses.
*  More Israeli airstrikes hit Beirut's southern suburbs overnight.
*  Israel's army announced it killed Hashem Safedin, presumed to be the next head of Hezbollah
*  after Israel assassinated its former leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an airstrike in September.
*  On Tuesday, Lebanese cabinet member Nasser Yassin said Lebanon will need $250 million
*  a month to help over a million people who've been displaced by Israel's assault.
*  He spoke ahead of an international summit on Lebanon taking place in Paris later this
*  week.
*  You know, overnight, we've seen more than one million people being displaced by the
*  attacks, hostilities, by the aggression.
*  And this is similar to an earthquake.
*  You don't see this number in its scale and the speed of it, except in major natural disasters.
*  And this is what happened in 48 hours.
*  Meanwhile, The Financial Times reports Israel's military forcibly entered a clearly marked
*  United Nations base and is suspected of using the incendiary chemical white phosphorus close
*  enough to injure 15 peacekeepers.
*  The use of white phosphorus as a weapon is a war crime under international law.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Israeli soldiers fatally shot an 11-year-old Palestinian child
*  during a raid Tuesday in the city of Nablus.
*  Abdallah Hawash was critically injured and later died of his wounds.
*  Over the past year, Israeli forces have killed at least 760 Palestinians in the West Bank,
*  while more than 11,400 have been arrested in the occupied West Bank in East Jerusalem.
*  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Saudi Arabia after wrapping up talks with
*  senior Israeli officials in Tel Aviv.
*  The State Department says Blinken urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to revive
*  Gaza ceasefire negotiations and pushed Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza.
*  On Tuesday evening, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Tel Aviv hotel where
*  Blinken was meeting with Israeli President Isaac Herzog.
*  They were demanding the U.S. pressure Israel into making a ceasefire deal that would see
*  the release of hostages held by Hamas.
*  The protesters, most of them family members of hostages, held signs reading,
*  No more war, no more bloodshed.
*  Free our state, free our hostages.
*  Blinken's 11th trip to the Middle East in just over a year comes as Axios reports.
*  The State Department is reviewing U.S. aid to Israeli units accused of killing, torturing
*  and sexually assaulting Palestinians.
*  The Republica reported in April that a State Department panel had recommended as long ago
*  as last December that multiple Israeli military and police units should be disqualified from
*  receiving U.S. aid under the Leahy Amendment, the 1997 law that requires the United States
*  to cut off financial aid to those credibly accused of human rights violations.
*  Secretary Blinken still has not taken any action.
*  Al Jazeera is continuing to demand for the immediate medical evacuation of two of its
*  journalists in Gaza injured in Israeli attacks.
*  Al Jazeera camera operator Fadi Awahidi was paralyzed after he was shot in the neck by
*  an Israeli sniper while reporting in Jabalia earlier this month.
*  Israeli authorities have blocked the evacuation of Awahidi from Gaza, as well as that of fellow
*  Al Jazeera camera person Ali Al-Attar to receive urgently needed medical treatment.
*  Al-Attar suffered serious injuries due to shrapnel from an Israeli airstrike in Dera
*  Bala causing a cerebral hemorrhage.
*  In related news, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders is leading a group of U.S. lawmakers urging
*  the Biden administration to open an investigation into the October 2023 Israeli attack that
*  killed Reuters video journalist Issam Abdullah in southern Lebanon.
*  Six others were injured, including reporters for Agence France-Presse and Al Jazeera.
*  Leaders of the BRICS alliance, led by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, have
*  gathered in the Russian city of Kazan.
*  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is attending the summit.
*  Its host, Russian President Vladimir Putin, said over 30 countries have expressed a desire
*  to join BRICS this year.
*  As the summit opened, U.S. Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin accused North Korea of deploying
*  troops to Russia.
*  He's the first U.S. official to make the claim after Ukrainian President Volodymyr
*  Zelensky accused North Korea of assisting Russia's occupation of Ukraine.
*  This follows a mutual defense pact signed by Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un
*  in June.
*  Former President Trump's longest-serving chief of staff has warned Trump meets the
*  definition of a fascist.
*  Retired Marine General John Kelly made the remarks in an on-the-record interview with
*  The New York Times.
*  Well, I'm looking at the definition of fascism.
*  It's a far-right, authoritarian, ultra-nationalist political ideology movement characterized
*  by a dictatorial leader, centralized hypocrisy, militarism, possible suppression of opposition,
*  belief in a natural social hierarchy.
*  So, certainly, in my experience, those are the types of things that you think will work
*  better in terms of running America.
*  Trump's former chief of staff, Kelly, said Trump's recent comments about employing
*  the military against domestic opponents had left him deeply bothered.
*  He recounted that Trump said on several occasions, quote, Hitler did some good things, too, unquote.
*  Separately, The Atlantic magazine reports Trump said during a private meeting at the
*  White House, quote, I need the kind of generals Hitler had, unquote.
*  Trump also reportedly referred to 20-year-old U.S. Army soldier Vanessa Guillen, whose 2020
*  murder at Fort Hood in Texas brought global attention to the epidemic of sexual violence
*  in the U.S. military.
*  Trump reportedly referred to her as a, quote, effing Mexican, though Trump used the expletive.
*  Trump reportedly ordered his then chief of staff, Mark Meadows, not to pay for Guillen's
*  funeral, something the military had promised to do.
*  Kamala Harris's campaign has said it regrets a decision to eject a Muslim-American Democrat
*  from a Monday evening rally in Metro Detroit, where Harris was joined onstage by Republican
*  former Wyoming Congressmember Liz Cheney.
*  Ahmed Ghanem, a Democratic Party activist, former House candidate for Michigan's 11th
*  District, says he RSVPed to the event, cleared security, was seated at the Royal Oak Musical
*  Theater when a staffer ordered him to leave or be put into the back of a police car.
*  Ghanem told the Detroit News he felt targeted because he's Muslim, adding, quote, I didn't
*  even have anything like a Palestinian kaffir, any signs or a banner, nothing.
*  None of that is allowed inside.
*  I guess that's how the Democratic Party deals with Muslims, he said.
*  This comes as a new poll from Arab News finds Arab Americans are slightly more likely to
*  vote for Donald Trump than Kamala Harris.
*  Georgia's Supreme Court has declined to reinstate election rules approved by a partisan,
*  pro-Trump majority on the Georgia state election board.
*  Among other things, the new rules would have required ballots to be hand counted, potentially
*  delaying results and sowing chaos on election night.
*  Later in New York, a federal judge has ordered former mayor, former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani,
*  to turn over his luxury Manhattan apartment and other prized possessions to a pair of
*  Georgia election workers whom Giuliani falsely accused of committing election fraud during
*  ballot counting operations in 2020, leading to a torrent of death threats from Trump supporters
*  against them.
*  and her daughter, Shea Moss, were awarded $146 million last year after Giuliani was
*  found liable for defaming them.
*  Along with his apartment, Giuliani will have to hand over his collection of luxury watches,
*  signed baseball memorabilia and a 1980 Mercedes-Benz previously owned by actor Lauren Bacall.
*  The judge has given him seven days.
*  The trial for a white former U.S. Marine who choked black street performer Jordan Neely
*  to death on a subway train in May of last year began this week in a Manhattan court.
*  Daniel Penny is facing charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide
*  for holding Neely in a chokehold until he died.
*  Neely, a 30-year-old beloved street performer, was unhoused and hungry and crying out for
*  help when the ex-Marine attacked him.
*  Neely was well known to New Yorkers and tourists as a talented Michael Jackson impersonator.
*  In Mozambique, more protests have erupted over allegations of fraud in the October 9
*  presidential parliamentary elections.
*  European Union poll observers on Tuesday noted irregularities during counting an unjustified
*  alteration of election results at polling station and district level and urged transparency
*  from Mozambique's election authorities.
*  Lawyers took to the streets of the capital Maputo despite a violent crackdown by Mozambique
*  security forces.
*  Our rights to protest as Mozambican citizens gave me the will to go to the streets.
*  What is happening in the country are things which I do not understand.
*  There are killings, kidnappings, and we end up not understanding who is behind it, and
*  automatically Mozambique is not safe anymore.
*  And the U.N. Biodiversity Conference, known as COP16, has opened in Cali, Colombia, as
*  indigenous and environmental activists demand world leaders enact bolder actions to protect
*  an estimated one million plant and animal species threatened by extinction, most of
*  them due to human activity.
*  The conference is taking place, as experts warn humanity is on the precipice due to worsening
*  biodiversity loss and the catastrophic impacts of the climate crisis.
*  This is Colombia's environment minister, Susana Mohammed.
*  This should be an international priority.
*  Resources for war, trillions of dollars, are immediately handed out.
*  In one week, billions of dollars were given for military weapons and bombs.
*  But we take years to obtain fair financing at the scale we need it when we talk about
*  the most important issue, to defend life.
*  This is what creates inclusive safety for everyone and provides a chance of survival
*  for younger generations.
*  Among the demands are the implementation of a $20 billion fund for global biodiversity
*  protection that was approved in 2022, which wealthier nations have failed to contribute
*  to, as promised, as well as financial support for indigenous communities that are in the
*  front lines of biodiversity protection.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
