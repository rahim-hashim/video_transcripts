*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=8.16s)]
*  I am Amy Goodman. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=12.92s)]
*  In Gaza, Israeli attacks have killed at least 52 Palestinians since dawn, after a wave of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=14.6s)]
*  strikes that killed 28 people on New Year's Day, including women and children. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Israeli air attacks struck northern Gaza's Jabalia, the central Barrej refugee camp, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=27.36s)]
*  Gaza's city, and a tent camp sheltering displaced families in Al Mawasi in southern [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=32.8s)]
*  Qanyounis, in an area designated by Israel as a so-called humanitarian zone. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=38.0s)]
*  This comes as a seventh infant in Gaza has died from hypothermia, while displaced people [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=43.84s)]
*  in tents struggle to keep warm amidst days of heavy rain. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=50.68s)]
*  We are living here in the cold, in a state of hunger and thirst, lacking clothes, blankets [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=58.28s)]
*  and mattresses. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  The rain pours on us all night while the tarps leak, and no one acknowledges us. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=64.96s)]
*  Last year, we lived in Rafah. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=70.12s)]
*  Before that, we were in Beit Lahya. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=72.64s)]
*  Then we moved to Rafah, and from Rafah we came to Qanyounis. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=74.92s)]
*  We still don't know what our fate is or where we will be relocated next. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=78.84s)]
*  New data show Gaza's population has fallen by 6 percent since the start of Israel's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=84.32s)]
*  assault in October of 2023. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics estimates about 100,000 people have left Gaza, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=92.52s)]
*  while more than 55,000 have been killed by Israeli attacks or are missing and presumed [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=98.83999999999999s)]
*  dead. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=103.56s)]
*  In the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Authority says it's temporarily halted the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=104.8s)]
*  Al Jazeera TV network from operating or broadcasting in the territory, citing what it calls [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=109.25999999999999s)]
*  inciting material and reports that were deceiving and stirring strife. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  This follows Al Jazeera's critical coverage of the Fatah faction, which dominates the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=119.6s)]
*  PA, as well as recent deadly clashes between Palestinian security forces and armed Palestinian [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=124.36s)]
*  groups. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=131.12s)]
*  Al Jazeera condemned the move to censor its coverage as, quote, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=132.12s)]
*  "...nothing but an attempt to dissuade the channel from covering the rapidly escalating [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=135.64s)]
*  events," they said. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=139.88s)]
*  Earlier in the United States, President Biden says the man who drove a pickup truck into [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=143.16s)]
*  throngs of New Year's revelers in New Orleans early Wednesday had posted videos to social [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=148.4s)]
*  media hours earlier pledging allegiance to the militant group ISIS. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=154.44s)]
*  The attack killed 15 people and wounded at least 35 others, carving a path of destruction [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=159.16s)]
*  down Bourbon Street before the assailant was killed in a firefight with police officers. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=164.88s)]
*  Donald Trump responded on social media, writing, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=171.28s)]
*  "...when I said that the criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  in our country, that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the fake news media, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=178.28s)]
*  but it turned out to be true," Trump wrote. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=183.68s)]
*  However, President Biden revealed the suspect is a 42-year-old U.S. citizen from Texas named [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  Shamsuddin Jabbar, who was born in Texas. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=193.84s)]
*  He served in the United States Army on active duty for many years. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=198.28s)]

*  The FBI also reported to me that mere hours before the attack, he posted videos on social [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=206.4s)]
*  media indicating that he was inspired by ISIS, expressing a desire to kill. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=212.28s)]

*  delayed for 24 hours following the attack. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=226.12s)]
*  The FBI said it found an explosive device in the Ford F-150 pickup truck used by the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=230.6s)]
*  suspect. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=235.92s)]
*  Shamsuddin Jabbar had two prior criminal offenses, one in 2002 for theft and another in 2005 [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=236.92s)]
*  for driving with an invalid license. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=243.72s)]
*  Jabbar obtained a real estate license in 2019. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=246.6s)]

*  estate agent. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=255.26s)]
*  Court documents showed Jabbar struggled with his finances. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=257.02s)]
*  In 2020, his second wife, his ex-wife, was granted a restraining order forbidding Jabbar [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=260.5s)]

*  erupting in flames moments later. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=296.02s)]
*  The blast sent up a huge column of smoke but caused only minor damage to the hotel. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=299.7s)]
*  The FBI said it was investigating whether the incident was an act of terrorism and whether [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=305.74s)]
*  it might be connected to the attack in New Orleans earlier Wednesday. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=309.94s)]
*  The cyber truck was rented in Colorado by someone using the same car rental app used [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=314.66s)]
*  by the New Orleans assailant. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=320.7s)]
*  But so far, officials have not publicly identified the body found inside the vehicle and have [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=323.22s)]
*  not determined whether the explosion was intentional. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WEFcnjB51c&t=327.98s)]
