# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” August 8, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ye3dzT9v40)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The World Health Organization has announced plans to send 1.2 million polio vaccine doses
*  to Gaza, amid fears of a polio outbreak after the virus was detected in wastewater.
*  Over the past 10 months, Israel has destroyed all of Gaza's wastewater treatment plants
*  and most of Gaza's sewage pumps.
*  The WHO says it's aiming to vaccinate 600,000 Palestinian children under the age of eight.
*  The WHO repeated its call for a ceasefire, saying its medical staff need absolute freedom
*  of movement to administer the vaccines.
*  This all comes as Israel's killed at least 27 more Palestinians in central and southern
*  Gaza in what Al Jazeera called a, quote, especially bloody day.
*  The dead included Nadi Salot, who worked with the humanitarian group World Central
*  Kitchen.
*  In April, a series of Israeli airstrikes killed seven other workers at World Central Kitchen.
*  One Israeli airstrike killed and wounded several displaced Palestinians in Dar al-Bala.
*  The missile fell, and the explosion was huge.
*  In front of me, there was about 15 to 20 wounded people.
*  The majority of them had their legs dismembered, their legs amputated.
*  After that hit, I went with my neighbor, whose leg was dismembered.
*  I went with him in the ambulance to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.
*  When we were at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, they hit the second strike.
*  We came this morning, as you can see, to this destruction.
*  We did not expect the strike to be this powerful and in this magnitude.
*  The scene makes you want to cry.
*  Children were fleeing.
*  It was like the end of the world.
*  The pictures speak louder than words.
*  Any more news on Gaza?
*  Turkey is formally asked to join South Africa's genocide lawsuit against Israel at the International
*  Court of Justice.
*  In election news in the United States, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz held rallies in Michigan
*  and Wisconsin Wednesday, as Republican VP candidate JD Vance also attended competing
*  events in both states.
*  This is Governor Walz speaking at the Democratic campaign rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.
*  In Minnesota, just like in Wisconsin, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they
*  make.
*  Even if we wouldn't make the same choices for ourselves, because we know there's a
*  golden rule.
*  Mind your own damn business.
*  Mind your own damn business.
*  I don't need you telling me about our health care.
*  I don't need you telling us who we love.
*  And I sure the hell don't need you telling us what books we're going to read.
*  At a separate rally Wednesday in Detroit, Michigan, Palestinian rights activist disrupted
*  a speech by Vice President Harris.
*  And he intends to end the Affordable Care Act.
*  You know what?
*  If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that, otherwise I'm speaking.
*  The protesters were chanting, Kamala, Kamala, you can't hide, we won't vote for genocide.
*  Ahead of the rally, leaders of the uncommitted national movement met Harris briefly and requested
*  a meeting to discuss demands for an arms embargo against Israel.
*  Harris is speaking at a United Auto Workers event today in Detroit.
*  Utah has enacted a ban on 13 books, 12 of them written by women, ordering their removal
*  from public schools and libraries.
*  PEN America says Utah's move is the first statewide book ban.
*  It includes the books Forever by Judy Blume, Oryx and Craik by Margaret Atwood, Milk and
*  Honey by Rukhbi Kaur, and Six Books by Sarah J. Maas, a popular young adult author.
*  In Bangladesh, Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus has returned home after being recruited to
*  lead an interim government following the ouster of the longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
*  student-led uprising.
*  Yunus spoke briefly after landing in Dhaka and addressed reports of attacks against minority
*  Hindu, Buddhist and Christian groups.
*  Our first order of business should be to restore law and order.
*  Until that is taken care of, we will not be able to proceed to further improve the situation.
*  You have shown faith in me, and the students here have reassured me to carry out that duty.
*  I request the residents of Bangladesh to believe in me.
*  If you do that, there will not be attacks at any locations in the country.
*  Mohammed Yunus also vowed to follow the lead of the student movement, saying, quote,
*  Whatever path our students show us, we will move ahead with that.
*  To see Democracy Now!'s interviews with Mohammed Yunus over the years, you can go to democracynow.org.
*  Police in Spain are searching for the Catalan separatist leader, Carlos Puigdemont, after
*  he returned to Barcelona, ending seven years in exile despite a pending warrant for his
*  arrest.
*  Puigdemont spoke at a rally in Barcelona earlier today.
*  Over the years, they persecuted us for listening to the voice of the people of Catalonia.
*  Years where there was a harsh repression from prison to exile that affected the lives of
*  thousands of people for being pro-independence, sometimes for the mere fact of speaking Catalan,
*  something suspicious.
*  Catalan separatist leader Carlos Puigdemont disappeared just after he spoke in Barcelona,
*  prompting a massive police search.
*  Roadblocks have been set up and the police are searching cars in the area in a massive
*  manhunt.
*  Major anti-fascist rallies took place across the United Kingdom Wednesday as communities
*  came together to counter the recent surge in far-right violence.
*  Members of Muslim and immigrant communities in Britain say the riots have left them feeling
*  unsafe.
*  The riots erupted after misinformation spread about a suspect in a recent stabbing spree
*  that killed three little girls.
*  British police have arrested some 400 white nationalists and warned rioters could face
*  terrorism charges and 10 years in prison.
*  We'll go to London later in the broadcast.
*  Russia's declared a state of emergency in Kursk and accused Kiev of a major provocation
*  amidst an ongoing Ukrainian incursion in the southwestern border region, which has killed
*  at least five people and injured 30 others since Tuesday.
*  The White House says it was not aware of the ground attack beforehand and would seek more
*  information from Ukraine.
*  In other news from Russia, Pavel Koshny, a pianist who was jailed for making videos condemning
*  the war on Ukraine, has died while in pretrial detention.
*  Meanwhile, Russian human rights advocate Oleg Orlov, who was recently freed in an historic
*  prisoner swap, says he's spoken with other released dissidents about possible future
*  prisoner exchanges.
*  Orlov, leader of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning group Memorial, gave interviews Wednesday
*  from Berlin, where he's living in exile.
*  Only super-repressive laws and jailing, jailing, jailing.
*  And these are demonstrative jailings that are showing society, this is what will happen
*  to you.
*  Have a look.
*  That's the only thing that disrupted the wave of the antiwar movement.
*  And still, I'm sure if the repressive component was reduced just a little, just a tiny bit,
*  we'll see how much the public actually supports Putin.
*  We will see the reality, not the illusion, that is being created now.
*  Back in the United States, an Arizona Republican involved in the 2020 fake-electors scheme
*  pleaded guilty and became the first person to be convicted in the state's wide-ranging
*  case.
*  Lorraine Pellegrino, who signed a document falsely claiming Donald Trump had won Arizona
*  in 2020, was sentenced to unsupervised probation.
*  Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows have also been charged in Arizona's fake-elector case.
*  Court papers released this week show the Arizona grand jury that indicted 18 Trump allies in
*  the case also wanted to indict Trump, but were advised against the move by state prosecutors.
*  In New York, Republican lawmakers in Nassau County approved a bill that would make wearing
*  a mask or any face covering in public a misdemeanor.
*  The measure contains exceptions for health and religious reasons that the New York Civil
*  Liberties Union calls wholly inadequate.
*  The NYCOU said in a statement, quote,
*  This comes as at least 84 countries have reported a summer COVID surge.
*  In France, dozens of athletes at the Paris Olympics have tested positive for COVID.
*  California is also experiencing a surge, the worst in two years.
*  Torrential rains and flash floods have killed at least 40 people in western Yemen and displaced
*  hundreds more from their homes.
*  In Australia, new research confirms water temperatures in and around the Great Barrier
*  Reef have reached their warmest in 400 years over the past decade, placing the world's
*  largest coral reef under even greater danger.
*  This is Benjamin Henley, one of the study's co-authors.
*  In Arizona, the Wallopi Nation is suing the Bureau of Land Management,
*  over its approval of a lithium exploration project.
*  The lawsuit accuses the federal agency of failing to properly evaluate the project's
*  impacts on local water wells and springs.
*  And in the UK, police arrested 22 people over a planned climate camp near the Drax power
*  station in North Yorkshire.
*  It's the latest example of UK authorities intensifying criminalization of climate activism,
*  including before any actions even take place.
