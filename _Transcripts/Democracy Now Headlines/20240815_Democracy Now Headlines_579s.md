# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” August 15, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE_tFkoZpBo)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, DemocracyNow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel's killed over 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza since October 7th, according to Gaza's
*  health ministry.
*  Over a third of those, more than 16,000 Palestinians, were children.
*  But that grim milestone is still believed to be a vast underestimate, with many buried
*  under rubble and large numbers of Gazans facing life-threatening health emergencies.
*  Among the dead are twin newborns, their mother and their grandmother, who were killed in
*  an Israeli attack this week on Dera Bala, as their father went to retrieve their birth
*  certificates.
*  I was going to get the birth certificates for the children.
*  My wife gave birth the day before yesterday.
*  I went to get the birth certificates.
*  I got two babies, twins.
*  I got a call telling me that the house you were staying in got bombed.
*  People from the neighborhood called me.
*  My wife is gone, with my two babies and my mother-in-law.
*  The babies were named Aser and Aysel, their mother, Dr. Juman Arfa, a pharmacist.
*  This comes as critical ceasefire and hostage release talks are now underway in Doha.
*  More than 100 media workers, news outlets and press freedom groups are calling on U.S.
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken to immediately stop arming Israel.
*  Israel's ongoing assault on Gaza has killed at least 160 journalists since October 7,
*  the largest death toll of media workers in any conflict, including World War II.
*  Journalists, including Pulitzer Prize winners Laura Poitras and Spencer Ackerman, along
*  with groups including the Courage Foundation, defending rights and dissent and Roots Action,
*  write in a joint letter, quote,
*  Israel's deliberate targeting of these journalists seems intended to impose a near-blackout on
*  coverage of its assault on Gaza by providing the weapons being used to deliberately kill
*  journalists you are complicit in one of the gravest affronts to press freedom today, they write.
*  The embattled president of Columbia University has stepped down after just one year on the job.
*  Menouh Shafik's resignation comes in the wake of her widely condemned crackdown on
*  campus protests against the war on Gaza, during which she called in the New York Police Department,
*  which violently cleared tents and arrested scores of peaceful student protesters.
*  Shafik said, quote,
*  I have decided my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the
*  challenges ahead, unquote.
*  She plans to return to the U.K. to work in international development for the labor government.
*  In response to the news, the Columbia chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace said, quote,
*  The students of Columbia will never forget the sheer violence unleashed upon us by Menouh
*  Shafik, and we will not be placated by her removal as the university's repression of
*  the pro-Palestinian student movement continues, unquote.
*  You can see our coverage of the student uprising for Palestine at Columbia and colleges across
*  the country at democracynow.org.
*  In related news, five University of Chicago graduates who participated in Palestinian
*  rights protests finally received their diplomas more than two months after graduation.

*  On Wednesday, Donald Trump launched more attacks against Kamala Harris.
*  In North Carolina, rally his presidential campaign billed as a major economic address.
*  In more election news, The Washington Post reports Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought a meeting
*  with Kamala Harris to ask for a cabinet position in exchange for his endorsement.
*  The offer was rebuffed.
*  R.F.K.
*  Jr. reportedly met with Trump in July to offer his endorsement to him in exchange for a high-level
*  public health position.
*  A top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has denied a report in The Wall
*  Street Journal that his government approved a plan to blow up the Nord Stream pipelines
*  in September of 2022.
*  According to The Wall Street Journal, a six-member crew of Ukrainian civilians and active-duty
*  soldiers used a small rented yacht, satellite navigation, sonar and seabed maps to reach
*  the Nord Stream pipelines in the bottom of the Baltic Sea, where divers used an explosive
*  known as HMX and timer-controlled detonators to rupture the pipelines, triggering a massive
*  release of methane gas.
*  The blast severed three of the four pipelines that carried Russian gas to Europe.
*  Volodymyr Zelenskyy reportedly approved the plan, but later sought to halt it after a
*  Dutch intelligence agency learned of the plot and informed the CIA.
*  Zelenskyy's commander-in-chief, Valery Zaluzhny, who was leading the effort, reportedly forged
*  ahead with the plan despite Zelenskyy's U-turn.
*  In Tanzania, senior opposition leaders have been freed on bail after their arrest alongside
*  more than 500 young activists who were barred on Monday from staging a rally marking International
*  Youth Day.
*  Among those detained in the crackdown was Freeman Mbui, a presidential candidate and
*  leader of the Tanzanian opposition party, Chidema.
*  Earlier this year, Tanzania's president, Sami Hassan, lifted a ban on opposition gatherings
*  that had been in place since 2016, but on Monday, authorities said they would not allow
*  protests to continue, citing weeks of youth-led anti-government demonstrations in neighboring
*  Kenya.
*  The World Health Organization declared MPACS a global public health emergency after an
*  outbreak of the viral disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo spread to a dozen other
*  African countries.
*  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the threat of cross-border spread remains
*  high.
*  It's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks
*  and save lives.
*  A public health emergency of international concern is the highest level of alarm under
*  international health law.
*  Workers with the United Farm Workers, the Union of Southern Service Workers, Starbucks
*  Workers United and others are organizing around the United States under the banner of Heat
*  Week, demanding protections from extreme heat.
*  Earlier this month, a 36-year-old sanitation worker in Baltimore, Maryland, Ronald Silver,
*  collapsed and died while on the job as the heat index reached 105 degrees Fahrenheit.
*  Meanwhile, here in New York, a climate protester was taken to the hospital Wednesday after
*  a Citibank security guard punched him in the face while he was documenting a peaceful demonstration
*  as part of the Summer of Heat campaign.

*  all summer.
*  Citibanks invested nearly $400 billion into fossil fuel projects since the Paris Climate

*  the heat index approaching 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
*  The for-profit company operating Puerto Rico's grid, Luma Energy, said it was focused on
*  restoring power to hospitals and essential services like water and sanitation.
*  It's the latest in a series of power outages since Puerto Rico privatized its electrical
*  grid in the wake of 2017's devastating Hurricane Maria.
*  Despite the persistent blackouts, Puerto Ricans pay some of the highest electricity rates
*  in the United States.
*  And in Afghanistan, Taliban rulers held a military parade in Kabul, marching through
*  the former U.S. air base to mark three years since their return to power.
*  The U.N.'s warned of a worsening humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan and a gender apartheid
*  where women and girls have largely disappeared from public life.
*  Meanwhile, Afghans are calling on the U.S. and Europe to release billions of dollars
*  of frozen Afghan assets.
*  These billions of dollars that are frozen are not related to the Emirate government
