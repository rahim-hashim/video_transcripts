We continue our conversation with Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who responds to President Donald Trump's freezing of trillions in federal funding this week, which the White House walked back just a day later. Wyden helped pressure the administration to abandon the plan after publicizing how it disrupted Medicaid payments in states across the country. "The credit deserves to go to the whistleblowers who brought it to us," he says. Wyden also discusses the confirmation hearings for former Democratic Congressmember Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, as well as the growing influence of Big Tech oligarchs and the deadly air crash in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday.

# Medicaid Under Attack: Wyden on Funding Freeze Fiasco & Project 2025's Russ Vought, Trump's OMB Pick
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM)
*  Senator Wyden, we'd also like to ask you about the White House budget office's decision [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=0.0s)]
*  to rescind an order to freeze trillions of dollars of federal grants and loans. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=4.8s)]
*  The initial order from Matthew Waithe, the acting director of the White House Office [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=9.58s)]
*  of Management and Budget, set off chaos around the country as funding for critical programs, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=13.58s)]
*  including Medicaid, Head Start, Meals on Wheels, and many others, appear to be in jeopardy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=18.66s)]
*  The OMB rescinded the memo after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., temporarily halted [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=24.0s)]
*  the radical plan. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=29.5s)]
*  This all comes as Trump has nominated the architect of Project 2025, Russell Vogt, to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=31.06s)]
*  head the OMB. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=36.42s)]
*  During his recent confirmation hearing, Vogt was questioned by our guest, by you, Democratic [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=38.38s)]
*  Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=42.88s)]
*  I think the distillation of the Trump economic program is to give tax breaks to all the people [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=46.58s)]
*  at the top, and it's going to be paid for by these kinds of cuts, cuts in inefficient [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=52.58s)]
*  health care programs like Medicaid and hunger programs and the like. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=59.3s)]
*  And I'd like to know, does that concern you at all, that we have these values that are [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=64.14s)]
*  going to help the people right at the top, at the tippy top of the top, and we're going [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=70.62s)]
*  to cut these programs like Medicaid and hunger? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=76.06s)]
*  Are those your values? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=78.82s)]
*  Do you think that that's something that is in line with American values? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=80.38s)]
*  Because I think we want everybody to have a chance to get ahead. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=84.78s)]
*  Senator, I fully support the notion that we want everyone to get ahead, and we would not [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=88.02000000000001s)]
*  characterize our economic program that way. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=93.58000000000001s)]
*  We think it's important to give people tax cuts at all levels. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=97.30000000000001s)]
*  The president wants to extend those tax cuts. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=101.94000000000001s)]
*  But what about the vulnerable people who are going to get hurt in the process? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=104.54s)]
*  So that was Democratic Senator Ron Wyden questioning OMB nominee Russell Vogt. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=110.06s)]
*  I mean total chaos this week. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=115.58000000000001s)]
*  You have President Trump proposing to cut trillions of dollars from programs to the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  neediest Americans. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=125.58000000000001s)]
*  And then, because of enormous outcry, he pulls back. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=127.62s)]
*  And you are leading the charge, Senator Wyden, to call for a postponement of the vote on [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=132.70000000000002s)]
*  Russell Vogt to be the head of OMB. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=138.54000000000002s)]
*  Can you talk about him as one of the key architects of Project 2025 and what that is and why you're [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=141.5s)]
*  calling for this delay? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=147.58s)]
*  There is no question in my mind that this is a person who has got a laser target out [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=149.98000000000002s)]
*  there for Medicaid. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=156.54000000000002s)]
*  Medicaid, of course, is a lifeline for millions of people. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=158.06s)]
*  And in fact, one of the things that was good this week that happened is when we heard that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=161.86s)]
*  Donald Trump was going to cause bedlam in the Medicaid portals, the activists who are [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=167.58s)]
*  supportive of Medicaid got in touch with me. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=172.10000000000002s)]
*  I put it online. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=174.74s)]
*  And all over America, so many people spoke out against Trump's efforts to cause harm [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=176.22000000000003s)]
*  to Medicaid. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=181.78s)]
*  We blocked it within 12 hours. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=183.02s)]
*  So we're going to be all in on this fight. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=185.3s)]
*  And Russell Vogt is the architect of it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=187.66000000000003s)]
*  The Project 2025 effort features a number of key kinds of questions. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=190.10000000000002s)]
*  But this is what he's—this is his big victory that he wants to accomplish. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=195.34s)]
*  So what do you accomplish by postponing the vote? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=200.86s)]
*  What we do is we give a chance for more people to see what's at stake. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=204.54000000000002s)]
*  It's kind of like, you know, Donald Trump has consistently not paid the bills that he [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=208.86s)]
*  owed when he was in the private sector. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=214.10000000000002s)]
*  So a judge basically caught up with him, and that's how we helped to block the freeze. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=216.14000000000001s)]
*  We're going to get the word out, just as I did when the Medicaid portals were closed [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=221.5s)]
*  down there for a few hours. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=226.54s)]
*  What happened was those activists and those whistleblowers got in touch with me. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=228.5s)]
*  I put it out all across the country. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=232.26s)]
*  The credit deserves to go to the whistleblowers who brought it to us. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=234.82s)]
*  We get additional time. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=239.26s)]
*  We can block these cuts, too. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=240.42s)]
*  And Senator Ron Wyden, could you also comment on the confirmation hearing forthcoming for [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=242.89999999999998s)]
*  to become director of national intelligence? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=248.86s)]
*  You've worked with her in the past on privacy legislation, but you've expressed some concerns [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=251.46s)]
*  about her potentially occupying this position. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=256.82s)]
*  If you could elaborate. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=260.26s)]
*  I'd like to find out what her current positions are on matters like the Foreign Intelligence [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=261.58000000000004s)]
*  Surveillance Act, which is a hugely important issue. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=266.7s)]
*  At one time, she was against it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=270.98s)]
*  Now she seems that she may be for it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=273.7s)]
*  I'm also very concerned about Americans being swept up in these searches. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=276.70000000000005s)]
*  So we're going to get to the bottom of what her positions actually are. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=281.06s)]
*  And clearly, the Trump people have been lobbying her hard. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=285.66s)]
*  If you could talk more about that, because, Senator Wyden, you are known as a leader on [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=289.74s)]
*  challenging these FISA courts. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=293.74s)]
*  For those who aren't so familiar, we have a global audience. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=296.90000000000003s)]
*  Explain your deep concerns, how she agreed with you as a congressmember, and then what [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=300.66s)]
*  exactly, how she's turned around. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=305.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, what I think she was concerned about was law abiding Americans getting swept up [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=308.58000000000004s)]
*  in the warrant process. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=314.46000000000004s)]
*  And I have led that effort, and I'm sure we'll talk about that today. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=316.22s)]
*  But I think on top of that, she is concerned that civil liberties are just getting the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=321.46000000000004s)]
*  short shrift. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=327.34000000000003s)]
*  You know, I believe that security and liberty are not mutually exclusive. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=328.34000000000003s)]
*  You can have both. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=333.66s)]
*  You can have your freedoms and have security. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=334.70000000000005s)]
*  I think she said that in the past. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=337.3s)]
*  The question is, will she say it again today? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=339.46000000000004s)]
*  Senator Wyden, could we also ask you about, you've commented on this, the fact that at [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=341.90000000000003s)]
*  the Trump's inauguration, there were all of the leading tech CEOs, from Zuckerberg to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=348.14000000000004s)]
*  Sundar Pichai, and of course, Elon Musk, who is now formally a member of Trump's administration. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=355.86s)]
*  You've done a great deal of work on tech. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=363.26000000000005s)]
*  What are your concerns about the proximity of these tech CEOs to the Trump administration? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=365.98s)]
*  Well, it clearly sent a message that his real friends, his real allies are the billionaires. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=371.70000000000005s)]
*  Let me tell your listeners, though. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=378.3s)]
*  I think that what Mark Zuckerberg did, toadying up to Trump here recently and saying he'd [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=380.18s)]
*  give up his fact checkers, was just god-awful. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=386.90000000000003s)]
*  I think what it does is it sends a message to all the big tech companies, hey, you can [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=390.98s)]
*  do what I did, maybe line up a favor in the future with Donald Trump, and we can reconsolidate [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=396.06s)]
*  big media the way it was before the internet. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=402.14s)]
*  I wanted to go back to our headlines, Senator Wyden, to our first story, of course, this [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=405.94s)]
*  horrendous crash, midair crash over the Potomac between a Black Hawk helicopter and this American [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=410.42s)]
*  Airlines flight. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=420.94s)]
*  It looks like there are absolutely no survivors. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=422.09999999999997s)]
*  At least 30 bodies have been pulled. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=426.29999999999995s)]
*  It's American Airlines. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=428.38s)]
*  The crash coming just days after the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, Mike [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=429.9s)]
*  Whitaker, stepped down. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=436.34s)]
*  Now, this is extremely significant. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=438.26s)]
*  FAA administrators usually serve five-year terms. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=440.85999999999996s)]
*  Trump has not named a replacement. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=446.26s)]
*  Whitaker announced his planned departure in December after SpaceX CEO and Trump donor [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=450.41999999999996s)]
*  Elon Musk repeatedly attacked him on social media, attacked Whitaker, saying he needs [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=457.61999999999995s)]
*  to resign. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=463.46s)]
*  I mean, on the one hand, the power of the richest man on earth working with Trump, and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=464.46s)]
*  we don't know what happened here. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=470.85999999999996s)]
*  We cannot say why they crashed. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=472.78s)]
*  It is so rare to have this kind of collision. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=474.73999999999995s)]
*  Horrific. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=477.82s)]
*  But if you can comment on this. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=478.86s)]
*  Well, I'm certainly concerned about the Trump administration's policies as it relates [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=480.42s)]
*  to ensuring that we have adequate personnel to prevent this. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=486.46s)]
*  This is such a horrifying story that we have gotten this morning, the tragic loss of life. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=490.02s)]
*  And I will tell you, there are going to be a host of questions. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=496.86s)]
*  One of the first that I asked myself this morning is, what was that DoD helicopter doing [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=499.14s)]
*  in that particular place? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=505.1s)]
*  And so, we've got to make sure that we have the adequate personnel to prevent this in [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQGBS1Lj6pM&t=507.6s)]
