# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” September 13, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4pMdJzePkQ)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israeli strikes have killed at least 40 people across Gaza today, as U.N. Secretary General
*  Antonio Guterres is once again calling for an immediate ceasefire following Israel's
*  massacre at the U.N.-run Al Jouni School, which killed at least 18 people Wednesday,
*  including six U.N. workers, the deadliest day in Urwa's history.
*  The World Health Organization said Thursday it had evacuated about 100 people in need
*  of medical treatment from Gaza to the United Arab Emirates and called for regular evacuations
*  to resume after Israel's assault decimated Gaza's health system.
*  This is a cancer patient awaiting evacuation.
*  I am suffering from Hodgkin's lymphoma, and this type of cancer spreads very quickly.
*  In one or two months, it spreads throughout your entire body, unlike other types of cancer.
*  My trip was extremely tiring, and I came here to the South so I can travel and get treated
*  outside the country by God's will.
*  In related news, the WHO says a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza wounded by Israel's
*  ongoing assault have life-changing injuries.
*  The U.N. is warning the Palestinian economy, which was already devastated before October
*  due to Israel's occupation and blockade, is in freefall and could completely collapse.
*  The body of Aysenur Ezgi Egi, the 26-year-old Turkish-American activist who was killed by
*  Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank during a peaceful protest, has arrived in Turkey
*  ahead of her funeral.
*  On Thursday, Aysenur's father, Mehmet Swat Egi, praised Turkey for investigating the
*  killing and called on the U.S. to do the same.
*  America is a different country.
*  When there is injustice or torment towards its citizens, or they are killed in any country
*  in the world, it lands on that country like the eagle on its emblem.
*  But when the subject is Israel, there is more of an effort to dodge it.
*  But I want to believe that people will listen to their conscience.
*  Earlier this week, The Washington Post published an investigation corroborating eyewitness
*  accounts that the protests Aysenur Ezgi Egi had been taking part in were already over
*  when Israeli soldiers opened fire, killing her.
*  Meanwhile, three top Democrats from Aysenur's home state of Washington, Senators Maria
*  Cantwell and Patty Murray and Congressmember Pramila Jayapal, called on the Biden administration
*  to investigate her killing.
*  On Wednesday, hundreds of people gathered at a Seattle beach for a vigil honoring the
*  recent University of Washington graduate.
*  A North Dakota judge struck down the state's near-total abortion ban Thursday, ruling North
*  Dakota's constitution ensures the right to an abortion before fetal viability.
*  While the ruling is a major victory for abortion rights, North Dakota no longer has any abortion
*  clinics after the overturning of Roe v. Wade triggered the state's ban.
*  If the ruling is not overturned in an appeal or the state legislature does not pass a new
*  ban, North Dakota could join Minnesota as a haven for patients seeking abortion care
*  in the Midwest.
*  Some 33,000 Boeing workers in Washington state and Oregon are walking off the job after overwhelmingly
*  rejecting a new contract.
*  It's Boeing's first strike in 16 years and will halt production on most of its aircrafts,
*  including its troubled 737 MAX.
*  Workers are seeking pay raises of 40 percent.
*  The tentative agreement only pledged to raise wages by 25 percent.
*  In related news, hotel workers in Boston, New Haven and San Diego have launched the
*  second wave of a phased strike that started at hotels around the United States on Labor
*  Day.
*  A federal jury in Florida has found members of a pan-Africanist group guilty of conspiring
*  with the Russian government to sow discord and interfere in U.S. elections.
*  As with the African People's Socialist Party, face up to five years in federal prison,
*  they plan to appeal.
*  Prosecutors argued the group's activities were not protected by the First Amendment
*  since they were done at the direction of a Russian operative named Alexander Inovol.
*  The defense argued the government aimed to censor the group after members criticized
*  U.S. foreign policy.
*  Jurors acquitted three of the activists, known as the Uhuru Three, on a more serious charge
*  of acting as agents of a foreign government.
*  Attorney Mutake Ackbar spoke after the verdict.
*  We had 12 people from this community that probably don't agree with most of the stuff
*  that they heard but understood their right to do it, one, and two, their sovereignty
*  in doing so, that they were doing it on their own behalf for African people.
*  So I think that sends a message to the government that these political prosecutions probably
*  won't work.
*  To see our interview with one of those on trial, Omali Yeshitela, chair of the African
*  People's Socialist Party, about the trial of the Uhuru Three, visit democracynow.org.
*  A judge in Georgia has dismissed two more charges against Donald Trump and one charge
*  against some of his co-defendants in the state's 2020 election subversion case.
*  Trump now faces eight charges in the racketeering conspiracy, down from the original 13.
*  In other Trump news, the former president says he will not take part in any more debates
*  against Kamala Harris before the election.
*  In Springfield, Ohio, a bomb threat on Thursday prompted authorities to order the evacuation
*  of City Hall and several municipal buildings.
*  Mayor Rob Rue said the threat came in an email from someone who cited frustration over the
*  city's resettlement of Haitian immigrants.
*  This comes after Springfield's city manager denied false racist claims made by former
*  President Trump and vice presidential candidate JD Vance that Haitian immigrants were eating
*  dogs and cats.
*  Several Democratic senators have criticized the Biden administration's move to send
*  $1.3 billion in military funding to Egypt, citing widespread human rights abuses by the
*  authoritarian government of General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
*  A portion of the money, less than a quarter, was conditioned on Egypt improving its human
*  rights record.
*  On Thursday, Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy wrote, quote,
*  It's no secret Egypt remains a deeply repressive autocratic state.
*  I see no good reason to ignore that fact by waiving these requirements," he said.
*  This comes as press freedom groups are demanding Egyptian authorities drop all charges against
*  four journalists recently detained and held incommunicado.
*  The disappearances of Ashraf Omar, Khaled Mamdouh, Ramadan Ghouida and Yasser Abou Elah
*  have sparked fear and trauma among Egyptian journalists.
*  At least two of them have allegedly been tortured.
*  In Nigeria, people are searching for their loved ones after major flooding killed at
*  least 30 people, submerged entire neighborhoods and displaced tens of thousands of people
*  in the Northeast.
*  I have one son, and I have not seen or heard from him in three days.
*  We got out on Tuesday after the flood overpowered us.
*  It was really hard for us to get out, but thanks to the soldiers who helped us to safety.
*  Right now, we are still searching for my son.
*  No headway yet.
*  We prayed to God to help us in this situation.
*  Democratic lawmakers Thursday unveiled the Polluters Pay Climate Fund Act that would
*  force fossil fuel companies to pay into a fund that addresses the harm and damages they
*  caused, unquote.
*  In related news, pressure is mounting for the Biden administration to cancel all new
*  liquefied natural gas export licenses after a judge recently lifted a pause on new LNG
*  export approvals.
*  In New York, police commissioner Edward Caban resigned Thursday at the request of Mayor
*  Eric Adams.
*  Caban's resignation came just days after federal agents searched his home and seized
*  his cell phone.
*  Agents also raided the homes of a top mayoral adviser, two deputy mayors and the New York
*  City Schools Chancellor.
*  It's one of the four separate corruption investigations by federal prosecutors targeting
*  Adams' inner circle.
*  And Chilean President Gabriel Boric says he will push for the repeal of a highly contested
*  amnesty law that has long barred investigations into crimes against humanity committed during
*  General Augusto Pinochet's military dictatorship.
*  On Wednesday, September 11th, Boric attended a ceremony marking the 51st anniversary of
*  the U.S. Baku, which overthrew elected President Salvador Allende and ushered in Pinochet's
*  17-year dictatorship, during which thousands of people were murdered, tortured and disappeared.
*  This is Jaime Vivanco, a relative of some of the victims.
*  Our society still does not assume that it has an historical duty to vindicate the disappeared
*  detainees, the politically executed and the tortured people.
*  We must learn from this and understand that if we do not assume this as a society, then
*  never again is not real and can be repeated.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
