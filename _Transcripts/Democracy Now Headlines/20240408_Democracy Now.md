*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Palestinians are returning to the devastated city of Chanyunas after Israel withdrew troops
*  from southern Gaza to prepare for an attack on Rafah.

*  and the release of all hostages still held in Gaza.
*  More than half the population, over a million people, are facing catastrophic hunger.

*  The hunger in the north is of a particular concern, where people have now resulted to
*  eat animal feed or tree leaves.
*  If we continue down this path of all parties to conflict, flagrantly breaching the rule
*  of war and international humanitarian law, zero accountability, powerful nations refusing
*  to use the levers of influence at their disposal, then the next set of mass deaths of children
*  in Gaza will not be from bullets and bombs.
*  It will be from starvation and malnutrition.

*  We're here in what used to be Al-Shifa Hospital in the north of Gaza and Gaza City.

*  In the present case, Nicaragua is also requesting the court to order that Germany cease providing

*  of the Palestinian people that is being subjected to one of the most destructive military actions
*  in modern history.
*  The ICJ hearing is being held as Al Jazeera reports a group of 600 civil servants in Germany

*  failed all of us.

*  importance when the lives of so many people were at stake.
*  We had a United Nations peacekeeping operation that was effectively dismantled and its size
*  was reduced drastically at the point where the Rwandan people lost their lives.

*  Meanwhile, ProPublica is reporting Trump's legal team may have violated ethics rules
*  by not telling an appellate court that a billionaire financier had agreed to help Trump post the
*  full $464 million bond set by the court in his civil fraud case.
