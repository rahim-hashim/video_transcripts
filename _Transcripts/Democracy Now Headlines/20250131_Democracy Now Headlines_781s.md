President Donald Trump's nominee for FBI director, Kash Patel, a Trump loyalist who has promoted right-wing conspiracy theories, is "one of Donald Trump's most disturbing picks" who seems poised to use the office to go after journalists and other Trump critics, says Chip Gibbons of the civil liberties organization Defending Rights & Dissent.

We also discuss Edward Snowden's case and what it revealed about government surveillance of the American public. President Trump's nominee for director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congressmember from Hawaii, is facing major qualms from her former colleagues. During her Senate confirmation hearing, Democrats grilled her over her refusal to label whistleblower Edward Snowden a "traitor."

# "Extraordinarily Dangerous": Chip Gibbons Warns Kash Patel Would Turn FBI Powers on Trump's Enemies

*  despite vocal opposition from the Democrats. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=21.38s)]
*  Cash Patel testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, downplaying his past promotion [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=24.6s)]
*  of right-wing conspiracy theories and said only 40 percent of Americans have faith in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=29.6s)]
*  the FBI. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  While Republicans hailed him as a reformer, Democrats grow Patel over his past comments, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=35.68s)]
*  calling for a so-called enemies list and praising the January 6 rioters. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=40.32s)]
*  This is Democratic Senator Dick Durbin ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=45.28s)]
*  Mr. Patel posted on social media, quote, January 6th, never an insurrection. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  Cowards in uniform exposed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=58.88s)]
*  End of quote. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  Let me repeat that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=64.28s)]
*  Cowards in uniform exposed. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=66.56s)]
*  Who was in the Capitol building on January 6th in a uniform? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=69.8s)]
*  The Capitol police were. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=73.68s)]
*  Do you think they were cowards? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=75.08s)]
*  Many of them risked their lives and some gave their lives in defense of this building. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=78.36s)]
*  How about the D.C. police who were here as well? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=81.72s)]
*  They were in uniform. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=85.0s)]
*  Cowards risking their lives as well. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=87.16s)]
*  Some of them being battered and beaten by these mobsters that came into the Capitol. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=89.44s)]
*  And Mr. Patel claims that the FBI agency aspires to lead, get this now, was planning January [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  6th for a year. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=101.44s)]
*  He says the FBI was planning January 6th for a year. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=102.84s)]
*  That's a quote. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=107.28s)]
*  Mr. Patel has gone so far as to co-produce and sell musical recordings of a song performed [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=108.28s)]
*  by January 6 rioters in jail. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=115.04s)]
*  Democrats also focused on Cash Patel's record of going after journalists and calling for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=118.48s)]
*  retribution against people he believes are trying to undermine President Trump. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  This is Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island questioning Patel. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=126.48s)]
*  Here's what this nominee himself has said about using his office to prosecute journalists. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=132.56s)]
*  We will go out and find the conspirators not just in government, but in the media. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=140.8s)]
*  We're going to come after you, whether it's criminally or civilly. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  Is that a correct quotation, Mr. Patel? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=152.4s)]
*  Senator, that's a partial quotation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=154.84s)]
*  But it's correct. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=158.44s)]
*  In part. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=160.56s)]
*  Regarding his publication of his enemies list, Mr. Patel proclaimed the manhunt starts tomorrow [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=162.44s)]
*  and reposted a video depicting him taking a chainsaw to his political enemies. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=171.48s)]
*  Is that you, Cash Patel, re-truth, reposting that at the top of that page? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=183.55999999999997s)]
*  Senator, I had nothing to do with the creation of that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=188.83999999999997s)]
*  Is that you reposting it was my question. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=192.48s)]
*  And that's me at the top. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=195.11999999999998s)]
*  You said FBI agents were responsible for the violence on January 6th, and I quote you here, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=198.84s)]
*  beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  Is that what you said? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=207.24s)]
*  That's completely incorrect and I appreciate the opportunity to address that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=208.24s)]
*  I'll give you an opportunity in writing, but this is my time now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  Have at it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=215.12s)]
*  An inspector attorney general investigation found that that was false. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=216.12s)]
*  And you said we should impeach judges who rule against Donald Trump, who are, in your [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=220.96s)]
*  words, political terrorists. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=226.6s)]
*  So that was Senator Whitehouse questioning Cash Patel. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=229.88s)]
*  This is Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=234.04s)]
*  Have you referred to the media as the most powerful enemy of the United States that they [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  have ever seen? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=242.78s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  Again, you're reading a quote. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  I take that you're reading an accurate— [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=246.48s)]
*  H2C PAC 223-24. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=247.48s)]
*  You said we're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=251.16s)]
*  who helped Joe Biden rig the elections. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  We're going to come after you, whether it's criminally or civilly. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=257.68s)]
*  Is that something you said? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=262.2s)]
*  That's a partial statement of what I said. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=263.2s)]
*  Steve Bannon's podcast. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=265.68s)]
*  You also said you would put the entire fake news mafia press corps on your list. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=268.36s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=273.0s)]
*  Is that what you said? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=274.0s)]
*  I don't have that in front of me. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=275.0s)]
*  Benny Johnson's podcast, 821-23. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=276.88s)]
*  For more on the Cash Patel and Tulsi Gabbard nomination hearings, we're joined now by [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=280.96s)]
*  Chip Gibbons from Washington, D.C., journalist, policy director of defending rights and dissent, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=285.76s)]
*  where he's advised multiple congressional offices on reforming the Espionage Act, currently [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=291.08s)]
*  working on a book on the history of the FBI for Verso books. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=295.32s)]
*  Chip, thanks for joining us. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  Before we move to Tulsi Gabbard, if you can talk about the—Cash Patel talking about [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  going after journalists and also making an enemies list. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=307.98s)]
*  Well, Cash Patel is one of Donald Trump's most disturbing picks, and that is saying [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=312.06s)]
*  something. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=316.82s)]
*  Patel's comments about going after journalists should be very alarming. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=317.82s)]
*  First of all, because no one should be in a law enforcement or intelligence position [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=321.66s)]
*  who wants to go after journalists. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=325.46000000000004s)]
*  And I think we have to clarify that the FBI is both a law enforcement agency and an intelligence [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=327.34000000000003s)]
*  agency. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=333.70000000000005s)]
*  It's been a hybrid agency since Hoover, and Hoover used the intelligence aspects of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=334.7s)]
*  the FBI to go after King, to go after civil rights protesters. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=340.3s)]
*  And in spite of this myth of sort of the reformed FBI, ever since then, they've been doing [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=344.5s)]
*  exactly the same thing. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=350.42s)]
*  While writing my book, I've come up with documents from right before 9-11 that show [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=352.34s)]
*  them spying on World Bank protesters with incredibly intrusive means. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=356.7s)]
*  So the FBI is a political police force, and we are nominating someone who has shown themselves [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=360.58s)]
*  to be gleeful about using its political policing powers. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=366.38s)]
*  The journalism comments are extremely disturbing because the FBI has broad powers to go after [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=370.46s)]
*  journalists. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=377.58s)]
*  Because the unauthorized disclosure of national defense information is governed by the Espionage [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=378.58s)]
*  Authority for enforcing leak investigations is in the intelligence division of the FBI, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=384.42s)]
*  the division with the least restrictions and most surveillance. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=392.22s)]
*  And I will note that the Heritage Foundation in Project 2025 has called for hiring more [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=395.5s)]
*  FBI counterintelligence agents with the goals of finding journalist sources and imprisoning [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=401.82s)]
*  them. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=409.38s)]
*  Unfortunately, there has been a bipartisan trend in this country to come after first [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=410.5s)]
*  journalist sources like Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning, and then under the Trump [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=415.26s)]
*  and Biden administrations, to go after journalist Julian Assange. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=420.34s)]
*  When you look at what was in the plea deal that Julian Assange agreed to, that he is [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=424.65999999999997s)]
*  a journalist and he worked with a source to publish classified information, and that is [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=429.9s)]
*  a conspiracy under the Espionage Act, Cash Patel has the perfect tool to go after Trump's [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=434.9s)]
*  critics and the media. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=441.02s)]
*  So Patel's desire to go after journalists and their sources, the fact that both parties [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=442.38s)]
*  have created and cemented the tools to do so, and the fact that the FBI is a political [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=449.65999999999997s)]
*  policing bureaucracy makes Patel an extraordinarily dangerous figure. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=455.5s)]
*  And we should be extremely concerned about what's coming down the pike, while also [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=460.74s)]
*  acknowledging that if we did not have this bipartisan building up of the surveillance [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=464.7s)]
*  state, this bipartisan ratification of the Espionage Act, this bipartisan use of it against [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=469.7s)]
*  whistleblowers like Snowden, journalists like Assange. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=475.98s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=479.42s)]
*  I want to go to Edward Snowden, meaning I want to turn to the confirmation hearings [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=480.42s)]
*  for Tulsi Gavrid Trump's pick for the director of national intelligence. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=485.1s)]
*  She refused to call whistleblower Edward Snowden a traitor. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=489.1s)]
*  Repeatedly throughout this hearing, this is a heated exchange with Colorado Senator Democrat [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=493.38s)]
*  Michael Bennett. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=498.82000000000005s)]
*  Was Edward Snowden a traitor to the United States of America? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=501.1s)]
*  Senator, I will also repeat my answer. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=504.86s)]
*  He broke the law. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=507.98s)]
*  I would like—you said earlier that you were offended by a question that my colleague from [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=508.98s)]
*  which I think was his duty as somebody on this committee to fulfill his responsibility [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=514.7s)]
*  to advise and consent. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=522.4200000000001s)]
*  We are not here to be a rubber stamp for the president of the United States. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=523.98s)]
*  So let me ask you again, do you believe, as the chairman of this committee believes, as [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=527.86s)]
*  the vast majority of members of our intelligence agencies believe, that Edward Snowden was [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=534.1400000000001s)]
*  a traitor to the United States of America? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvyizbURdw&t=540.3000000000001s)]
