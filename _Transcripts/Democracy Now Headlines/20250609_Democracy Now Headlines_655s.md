Eleven peace activists and one journalist on board the Gaza Freedom Flotilla ship, the "Madleen," were detained by Israeli soldiers as their ship carrying vital humanitarian aid for starving Palestinians approached Gaza. The ship was intercepted by Israeli forces in the middle of the night in international waters. Its supplies were seized and communications jammed. The unarmed activists will likely be transported to Israeli detention or "immediately deported," says Ann Wright, a U.S. military veteran who has participated in four Freedom Flotilla journeys and now serves on the steering committee of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. She calls on citizens of countries around the world to push for the activists' release and an end to Israel's war on Gaza.

*  immediately rather than going into the prison. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=530.36s)]
*  That's something our lawyers, Adala, who are Palestinian lawyers that are in Palestine [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=533.6s)]
*  48, that are confirming with us. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=539.0s)]
*  So it may be that some of them don't go to give-on prison. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=541.88s)]
*  We thank everyone for their support. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=546.3199999999999s)]
*  There are other things that are happening in the region, the global march to Cairo, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=549.1999999999999s)]
*  the Tunis, Samud march. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=553.0400000000001s)]
*  There are so many things people can do to keep Gaza and the West Bank in their mind. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=556.0s)]
*  You can have your own Gaza Freedom Flotilla in any water that's close to your house and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=561.0400000000001s)]
*  put a little Palestinian flag on a boat in the mud puddle, even. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=565.36s)]
*  It's solidarity that we need right now for the people of Gaza. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=569.84s)]
*  And we will be sending more boats in the Gaza Freedom Flotilla and very, very soon. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=573.4000000000001s)]
*  So thank you all for the support, and let's make sure this genocide and ethnic cleansing [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  that the Israelis are doing in Gaza and the West Bank ends now. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=584.8000000000001s)]
*  Pressure on our governments, whether they be the U.S., French, German, Sweden, Brazil, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=588.76s)]
*  Turkey, Spain, the Netherlands that were on that boat. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=593.9200000000001s)]
*  And we will have a U.S. citizen on this next boat. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=596.76s)]
*  And we just have a few seconds, but the Turkish government immediately, the foreign ministry [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=601.36s)]
*  declared Israel a terror state and demanded the freedom of its two nationals that were [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=606.24s)]
*  on this boat. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=611.92s)]
*  What about other governments? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=613.28s)]
*  Well, the other governments have been silent so far, but that's where citizen pressure [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=614.28s)]
*  comes in. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=619.76s)]
*  So call the foreign ministries of all of those countries and put pressure on them. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=620.76s)]
*  And don't forget the old United States of America, the most complicit country in the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=626.48s)]
*  genocide of Gaza. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=630.5600000000001s)]
*  So it's up to us as citizens to keep the pressure on. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=632.96s)]
*  We've got citizens that are out in front of the United Nations every day on the hunger [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=636.2s)]
*  strike, and they're going to be going to the national missions of each of those countries [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=639.44s)]
*  that have citizens on the Madeleine. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88GBdkmgm0&t=644.72s)]
