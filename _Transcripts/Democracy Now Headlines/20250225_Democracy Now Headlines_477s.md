DAWN, a D.C.-based nonprofit organization that supports democracy and human rights in the Middle East and North Africa, is asking the International Criminal Court to investigate former President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for possible complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity, citing the $17.9 billion worth of U.S. weapons transfers to Israel overseen by the Biden administration. "The bombs that Israel has used to destroy schools, hospitals and homes in Gaza were American bombs that they provided. Israel's campaign of murder and persecution was carried out with political support that they ensured," says Reed Brody, a longtime war crimes lawyer and a board member at DAWN. Biden, Blinken and Austin were not only "aware of what was being done with their ammunition," but also "tried to stifle criticism" of their policies. Furthermore, says Brody, U.S. complicity in Israeli war crimes could extend into the Trump administration. He suggests that the ICC prosecutor "would be well within his rights" to open a probe into Trump following the administration's sanctions on the ICC in response to arrest warrants issued against Israeli officials.

# Biden, Blinken & Austin Accused of Complicity in Israel's Gaza War Crimes; ICC Urged to Investigate
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng)
*  Democracy depends on a free press. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=0.0s)]
*  Please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=2.64s)]
*  We turn now to an effort to hold the Biden administration accountable for their role [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=7.8s)]
*  in Israel's war in Gaza. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  The D.C.-based nonprofit Dawn has formally asked the International Criminal Court to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  investigate former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=17.92s)]
*  and President Joe Biden for their, quote, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=23.56s)]
*  "...accessorial roles in aiding and abetting, as well as intentionally contributing to Israeli [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=26.259999999999998s)]
*  war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza." [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=33.8s)]
*  Unquote. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=36.56s)]
*  These crimes include those identified in the ICC's arrest warrants issued last year against [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=37.56s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Galant. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=42.36s)]
*  We're joined right now by Reed Brody, well-known veteran war crimes prosecutor on the board [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=47.76s)]
*  of Dawn. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=54.96s)]
*  Can you explain the significance of this suit as we speak to you in Geneva, Switzerland? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=56.84s)]
*  Reed? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=61.92s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=62.92s)]
*  As you said, Amy, in November, the ICC issued warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=63.92s)]
*  Galant for starvation as a method of warfare, for intentionally directing attacks against [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=69.52s)]
*  civilians, for the crime against humanity of murder and of persecution. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=75.72s)]
*  But they didn't act alone. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=80.84s)]
*  And under the ICC statute, you can also be held liable for aiding and abetting a crime. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  And in order to do that, you have to have assisted in the commission of the crime with [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=89.68s)]
*  knowledge that the crime was being committed or was going to be committed in the ordinary [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=96.2s)]
*  course of events. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=101.5s)]
*  And that's what we say that Biden, Blinken and Lloyd Austin did here. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=103.24s)]
*  The bombs that Israel has used to destroy schools, hospitals and homes in Gaza were [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  American bombs that they provided. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=116.32s)]
*  Israel's campaign of murder and persecution was carried out with political support that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=120.96s)]
*  they insured. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=127.0s)]
*  These officials were aware, as we explained in the complaint, that Israel was committing [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=128.52s)]
*  these crimes, and yet they insured that the political, diplomatic and military support [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=133.32000000000002s)]
*  continued. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=140.10000000000002s)]
*  Our submission has 172 pages. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=143.0s)]
*  It shows in detail how Biden, Blinken and Lloyd Austin insured that $17.9 billion in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=145.8s)]
*  military assistance was sent, how real-time intelligence was given, how the U.S. vetoed [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=156.8s)]
*  resolutions at the U.N. Security Council. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=166.68s)]
*  And we go, we show how, in many instances, these officials actually overruled people [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=168.76s)]
*  below them who said, you know, war crimes are being committed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=173.98s)]
*  You can't, under American law, under international law, you know, provide this assistance. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=176.84s)]
*  But I think our submission shows that Biden, Blinken and Austin are not only morally and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=183.68s)]
*  politically complicit, but they're legally complicit. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=190.72s)]
*  And, Reed, Reed, has there been any precedent in terms of the aiding and abetting of provision [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=194.96s)]
*  in the past before the court? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=207.96s)]
*  I mean, our case is based on very solid precedents. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=208.96s)]
*  The best example is the case of Charles Taylor, the former president of Liberia, who was convicted [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=211.8s)]
*  by the special court of Sierra Leone for aiding and abetting the rebels in Sierra Leone, you [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  know, the ones who cut off people's hands, arms, a country that he never set his foot [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=228.12s)]
*  in. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=233.84s)]
*  And they said Charles Taylor was aware of the crimes that were being committed by his [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=234.84s)]
*  Sierra Leonean allies. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=239.56s)]
*  And yet he continued to give them arms and he continued to encourage them. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=242.68s)]
*  What I like to say is imagine that a gunman is on a killing spree and he runs into a—the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=248.36s)]
*  owner knows what the man is doing, says, quick, quick, I need more ammunition. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=256.76s)]
*  And the owner says, here, here, here, but be careful how you use it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=261.08s)]
*  That's the situation we're in. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=265.2s)]
*  These officials were aware of what was being done with their ammunition, except in our [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=267.72s)]
*  case they also tried to stifle criticism of the—of what the gunman was doing, and they [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=272.44s)]
*  did it again and again. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=280.16s)]
*  And Reed, you filed this under an Article 15 submission. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  What is that, precisely? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=287.56s)]
*  So under Article 15 of the ICC's governing Rome statute, NGOs, individuals, victims can [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  provide information to the ICC prosecutor. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=298.12s)]
*  Now, the ICC prosecutor already has an investigation open into the crimes committed by Hamas and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  committed by Israeli officials. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=309.88s)]
*  So this will go into that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=312.12s)]
*  The prosecutor does not usually talk about what, you know, what he does with his investigation. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  We know that investigation is ongoing. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=321.4s)]
*  And what we're saying is don't just go—I mean, we're hoping that, of course, other [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=323.68s)]
*  individuals in the theater are named, but we also say look at the people behind them, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=328.47999999999996s)]
*  look at the people who have aided and abetted this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  Reed, earlier this month, President Trump signed an executive order authorizing sanctions [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  against the ICC over its war crimes investigations against Israel. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=345.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=348.8s)]
*  Dawn has stated that Trump's order against the ICC could subject him to, quote, individual [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=349.8s)]
*  criminal liability for obstruction of justice. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  Can you explain what that's about and what you're asking for regarding Trump as well? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=363.56s)]
*  Well, we didn't ask for it in the communication. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=364.6s)]
*  But as you say, under Article 70 of the ICC Rome Statute, if it criminalizes as an offense [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=367.16s)]
*  against the administration of justice, what we Americans call obstruction of justice, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=376.0s)]
*  to for instance retaliate against a court officer for taking action. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=381.24s)]
*  So here the prosecutor has indicted, you know, Yoav Galant and Benjamin Netanyahu, and the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=387.48s)]
*  Trump administration has responded by levying sanctions on this man and on the court. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=394.36s)]
*  So that really sets, I mean the prosecutor would be well within his rights to open up [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=400.48s)]
*  an investigation of Donald Trump for these sanctions, as he would incidentally for the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=405.64s)]
*  nine years that Israel tried with three successive prosecutors to blackmail, harass and sting [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  them to prevent them from taking these actions. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=420.8s)]
*  Ree Brody, we thank you very much for being with us, veteran war crimes prosecutor, board [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=424.68s)]
*  member of Dawn, the nonprofit which has filed the communication with the ICC prosecutor [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zxBTQsvng&t=429.44s)]
