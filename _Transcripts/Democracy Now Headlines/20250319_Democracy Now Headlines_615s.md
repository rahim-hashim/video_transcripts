# Sabotaging Social Security: Trump & Musk Move Ahead with Plan to Gut Agency
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=2.48s)]
*  The Social Security Administration is considering drastic new, what they call anti-fraud measures [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=4.96s)]
*  that could disrupt benefit payments to millions of Americans. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=11.64s)]
*  This is according to an internal memo first obtained by the political newsletter Popular [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=15.72s)]
*  Information, authored last week by acting deputy Social Security Administration commissioner [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=20.12s)]
*  Doris Diaz. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  The changes proposed in the memo would force millions of customers to file claims in person [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=26.82s)]
*  at a field office rather than over the phone. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=33.38s)]
*  According to the memo, customers applying for retirement and disability benefits would [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=36.7s)]
*  be required for the first time to verify their identity through an online system. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=41.46s)]
*  If their identity can't be verified online, they would have to visit a field office in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=48.04s)]
*  person. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=52.58s)]
*  The memo estimates that 75,000 to 85,000 people per week would be diverted to field offices [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=53.84s)]
*  because of a large number of elderly and disabled adults do not have access to a computer or [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=60.940000000000005s)]
*  a smartphone and would be unable to complete the online identity verification requirement. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=66.68s)]
*  The memo acknowledges the strain—this would place on vulnerable populations—and lists [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=74.06s)]
*  disruption as well as legal challenges and congressional scrutiny among the risks of the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=79.54s)]
*  proposed changes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  A day before the memo was sent, The Washington Post reported Social Security Administration [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=85.92s)]
*  was considering ending telephone service for all claims under pressure from Doge, the Department [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=91.5s)]
*  of Government Efficiency. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=96.30000000000001s)]
*  Hours after The Washington Post report came out, the agency issued a press release claiming [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=98.0s)]
*  telephone services would not be eliminated. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  The proposed changes to Social Security come as Doge is targeting the agency for staff [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=105.38s)]
*  cuts of more than 12 percent. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=109.82s)]
*  We're talking about a lot of these offices being closed or severely limited in staffing, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=112.46s)]
*  and yet a deluge of people would be forced to go to these satellite offices, some of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=119.02s)]
*  them already closed. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=124.16s)]
*  For more, we're joined in Washington, D.C., by Judd Legum. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=125.8s)]
*  He is founder of the political newsletter Popular Information, which first reported [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=129.32s)]
*  Judd, lay it out for us. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=134.14s)]
*  What are the threats to Social Security right now? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=135.82s)]
*  Well, one thing, Amy, that we know is that this is no longer a proposal. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=138.98s)]
*  This is now happening. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=144.17999999999998s)]
*  The Social Security Office came out late yesterday with a press release at a news conference [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  announcing that these changes were taking place. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=151.84s)]
*  And there's a number of things that are happening, but the primary one that's of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=155.06s)]
*  concern is that as Social Security closes down field offices, as they reduce the number [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=158.58s)]
*  of staff who is available to speak with people making claims, they are going to require tens [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=166.5s)]
*  of thousands of people weekly to come into these offices. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=175.62s)]
*  And the people that I'm speaking to at the Social Security Administration believe that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=181.34s)]
*  this is an effort to break the organization, that there is no way, even at current staffing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  levels, for them to deal with this number of influx of people into their offices and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=192.73999999999998s)]
*  that it will create chaos. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=199.18s)]
*  And indeed, those implications are laid out in this memo itself, which I obtained and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=202.18s)]
*  published earlier this week. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=207.94s)]
*  Judd, what about this claim that Elon Musk has made that as much as 10 percent of Social [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=212.1s)]
*  Security payments are fraudulent? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=219.14000000000001s)]
*  What do you know about what the actual numbers are? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=225.58s)]
*  Yeah, there's no basis for that claim. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=229.82s)]
*  The best estimates from the government is that 1 percent of payments are inappropriate, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=235.26s)]
*  but those aren't necessarily payments that are related to fraud. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=241.9s)]
*  It's generally payments that are related to either the government or individuals not [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=245.1s)]
*  updating their records. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=249.5s)]
*  So what's happening here as well, and I think it's important to understand, is that this [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=252.66s)]
*  ID verification is, they're imposing this at the time of people applying for a claim. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=258.74s)]
*  And there are no benefits at the time of application. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  After you make that application for a claim, depending on the kind of claim, there are [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=270.62s)]
*  many steps that are already taken by Social Security to verify your identity. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=275.3s)]
*  They'll look at pay stubs, they'll look at employment records. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=279.98s)]
*  If it's a disability claim, they'll look at medical records. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=282.86s)]
*  There's all these steps that are taken to verify that you are who you say you are, and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=286.34s)]
*  you are or are not entitled to the benefits that you're seeking. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=292.18s)]
*  So the idea that this point, the point in which you're initiating a claim, is the point [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=296.94s)]
*  in which you need to impose this ID verification that requires people, many people, to come [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=303.14s)]
*  into the offices to fight fraud just doesn't make any sense, because no benefits are being [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=308.94s)]
*  distributed at that point in the process anyway. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=315.58000000000004s)]
*  And I want to go back to this issue of the staffing levels with Doge planning, about [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=319.22s)]
*  12 percent staff cut, about 7,000 employees. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=324.98s)]
*  Yet Social Security staffing is at a 50 year low, exactly at the time when more people [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=329.42s)]
*  are on Social Security than ever before, and those numbers are bound to grow over the next [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  couple of decades. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=342.42s)]
*  Yes, this was a problem. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=343.42s)]
*  This predated the second Trump administration. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=346.18s)]
*  I mean, this has been a problem, as you note, for many years. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=348.5s)]
*  And actually, just beginning at the beginning of January, before the Trump administration [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=351.22s)]
*  was put into place, there was a new rule for Social Security that you could no longer drop [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=356.62s)]
*  in. You can no longer simply show up at a Social Security office. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=363.3s)]
*  You have to make an appointment. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=367.58000000000004s)]
*  And depending on where you live, there was a wait time on average of 30 days. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=368.98s)]
*  That's the average. Of course, some people are waiting even longer than that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=374.66s)]
*  And so now we have a situation. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=378.54s)]
*  Then you're layering on top of this a significant staff cut. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=380.54s)]
*  There's already been thousands of people who have left through the fork memo that was [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=384.82s)]
*  sent out through other voluntary retirements. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=390.66s)]
*  They're trying to cut about 7,000 in total. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=393.78000000000003s)]
*  They're also closing dozens of these field offices. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=397.46000000000004s)]
*  And that's very significant, too, because already, even before these closures, some [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=401.06s)]
*  people would have to travel 100 miles or more to get to their field office. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=406.3s)]
*  It's not necessarily the case where it's around the corner. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=412.38s)]
*  Of course, some people are lucky. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=415.38s)]
*  There might be near an office they have to visit, but others are many, many miles away. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=416.58000000000004s)]
*  And those those commutes are going to be even longer. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=420.70000000000005s)]
*  And what the memo mentions, somewhat elliptically, but I think is important, is that especially [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=425.73999999999995s)]
*  when you're talking with very elderly or disabled populations, there are people who [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=431.05999999999995s)]
*  simply cannot make it to the office, to these offices. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=436.05999999999995s)]
*  They can they are not able to travel. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=440.21999999999997s)]
*  And there's really no provisions laid out in this plan to accommodate those people. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=442.7s)]
*  Judd, before we go, I wanted to ask you about the newsletter Musk Watch that you run, which [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=448.38s)]
*  focuses our reporting on billionaire Elon Musk's wealth, power and influence. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=456.78s)]
*  And last week, you launched the Musk Watch Doge tracker to see what's being cut and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=460.54s)]
*  who's being impacted. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=465.98s)]
*  And Musk has gone after it as well. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=468.54s)]
*  Talk about what you found. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=471.18s)]
*  Well, we really looked very closely at this website that Musk has has put up and tried to see. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=474.14s)]
*  He's claiming over one hundred and ten billion dollars in savings. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=480.14s)]
*  How much are actually itemized? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=484.38s)]
*  Only about thirty billion dollars. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=487.26s)]
*  But then how much are there are verifiable when you actually look at the actual primary [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=489.02s)]
*  sources? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=494.62s)]
*  How much can you actually determine has been cut? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=495.66s)]
*  And it's more around the range of what's being cut. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=498.62s)]
*  It's more around the range of eight billion. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=501.9s)]
*  So what we found is he is vastly overstating the number of cuts. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=504.62s)]
*  That doesn't mean the cuts aren't devastating. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=510.7s)]
*  If you're cutting a grant that's helping people avoid deadly diseases in other abroad, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=513.1s)]
*  that could have a big impact. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=521.42s)]
*  But the size of these cuts is not something that's going to make any kind of impact on [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=522.62s)]
*  the deficit, at least at this point. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=527.26s)]
*  And Musk has attacked it. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=529.1s)]
*  Musk has attacked it's essentially saying that we were claiming he's not cutting enough. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=532.1400000000001s)]
*  That's that's not what we're saying. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=538.62s)]
*  But yes, I don't think he appreciates people taking a close look at his claims. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=542.7800000000001s)]
*  But I think that's important. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=548.1400000000001s)]
*  The website he set up really doesn't provide enough transparency. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=549.74s)]
*  And so we've set up this this Musk Watch Doge tracker to try to really drill down. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=554.3000000000001s)]
*  You can look at each individual cut. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=559.2600000000001s)]
*  You can look at it by state. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKhCgNN00w&t=561.34s)]
