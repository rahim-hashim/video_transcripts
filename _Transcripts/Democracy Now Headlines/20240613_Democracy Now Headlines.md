# Top U.S. & World Headlines — June 13, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4iChli8ScQ)
*  AMY GOODMAN, WEDNESDAY NEWSHOUR, WEDNESDAY 10AM
*  The war and peace report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The official death toll in Gaza has topped 37,200 people, nearly 16,000 of them children,
*  with more than 85,000 injured.
*  Tedros Adnan Gubriasis, head of the World Health Organization, warned famine spreading
*  in Gaza.
*  TEDROS ADNAN GUBRIASIS, WEDNESDAY NEWSHOUR, WEDNESDAY 10AM
*  A significant proportion of Gaza's population is now facing catastrophic hunger and famine-like
*  conditions.
*  Despite reports of increased delivery of food, there is currently no evidence that those
*  who need it most are receiving sufficient quantity and quality of food.
*  AMY GOODMAN, WEDNESDAY NEWSHOUR, WEDNESDAY 10AM
*  This comes as deadly Israeli attacks continue across the Gaza Strip.
*  Fresh attacks on the Nusadat refugee camp have killed at least five people, while Israeli
*  soldiers are using explosives to level buildings in the center of Ra'afah.
*  Meanwhile, Israel's far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said this week he will confiscate
*  some $35 million in Palestinian tax revenue and transfer the money to Israeli families
*  who have lost relatives in Palestinian attacks.
*  On the diplomatic front, world leaders from the G7 nations are meeting in Italy, where
*  the U.S. says it will push its allies to back its proposed Gaza ceasefire deal.
*  Hamas has responded to the proposal, but on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony
*  Blinken said some of the group's requested changes are not workable.
*  Hamas responded in a statement, quote,
*  "'While Blinken continues to talk about Israel's approval of the proposal, we've not heard
*  any Israeli official voicing approval,' Hamas said.
*  The Republican-controlled House of Representatives Wednesday voted to hold Attorney General Merrick
*  Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over audio of President Biden's
*  interview with Special Counsel Robert Herr.
*  The Justice Department has already released the full transcript of the interview.
*  Herr was tasked with investigating Biden's handling of classified material.
*  He did not bring any charges against Biden, but Republicans claim they need the audio
*  as part of their impeachment effort against the president.
*  New York Democrat Jerry Nadler blasted his Republican colleagues as he spoke from the
*  House floor.
*  The Judiciary Committee under Republican control has spent the last 18 months and 20 million
*  taxpayer dollars in a desperate search to find something, anything that they can use
*  to damage President Biden and to protect Donald Trump.
*  The Justice Department, which Garland oversees, is not expected to prosecute Garland.
*  In other news from Capitol Hill, Senate Republicans Wednesday blocked a Democratic bid to pass
*  ethics and transparency legislation for the Supreme Court amid mounting corruption scandals
*  around the court's far-right justices.
*  Meanwhile in the House, Congress members Jamie Raskin and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have announced
*  a new ethics bill for the Supreme Court, which AOC said has been, quote,
*  captured and corrupted by money and extremism.
*  The constitutional and democratic crisis and threat that this current corruption crisis
*  on the court presents is a threat not just to American way of life and American democracy,
*  but it is a threat to our lives.
*  People have died and are dying after the Dobbs decision.
*  People have died and can die with the rollbacks of environmental provisions.
*  This comes as newly published audio recordings show Justice Samuel Alito lashing out at
*  ProPublica, which exposed Clarence Thomas for accepting lavish gifts from conservative
*  billionaire Harlan Crowe over decades.
*  We'll have more on this story after headlines with ProPublica reporter Justin Elliott
*  and documentarian Lauren Windsor, who went undercover to record Justice Alito's remarks.
*  The Southern Baptist Convention has voted to oppose in vitro fertilization.
*  A statement approved Wednesday by delegates to the church's annual meeting in Indianapolis
*  calls on Southern Baptists to, quote, reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life
*  of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage, unquote.
*  Southern Baptists are the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S.
*  with nearly 13 million members.
*  Their opposition to IVF comes just months after Alabama's Supreme Court
*  ruled frozen embryos have the same rights as children.
*  In climate news, Capitol Police arrested eight climate activists Wednesday after they
*  rushed the field of the annual Congressional Baseball Game in Washington, D.C.
*  Ahead of the protests, the group Climate Defiance blasted game organizers for allowing Chevron to
*  co-sponsor the game and noted Congress has failed to pass a single climate change bill this year.
*  This comes a day after police in New York arrested dozens of climate activists as they held a
*  protest outside the headquarters of Citibank, which continues to invest hundreds of billions
*  of dollars in the fossil fuel industry. Among those arrested was Dr. Sandra Steingreber,
*  a senior scientist with the Science and Environmental Health Network.
*  I'm a biologist. I'm not interested in writing eulogies for the species that I study, said Dr.
*  Steingreber as she was being arrested. Meanwhile, Indigenous-led climate activists rallied outside
*  the White House this week demanding President Biden halt the flow of oil through the Dakota
*  Access pipeline. This is Doug Crowe-Ghost, water director of the Standing Rock Sioux.
*  We come to you as Standing Rock and Cheyenne River youth, members of this country, members before the
*  United States, with even the United States before states were states. We were a people of this
*  country, this nation, this Indigenous land. We are Indigenous children. We are here to protect
*  the water, the land, the air and the environment.
*  The protests came as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gave the go-ahead for the highly
*  contested Mountain Valley pipeline to begin operating. The 300-mile pipeline is set to
*  carry 2 billion cubic feet of frat gas daily through Virginia and West Virginia despite vocal
*  opposition from local communities and environmental groups. In another setback for the global climate
*  movement, Swiss lawmakers have rejected a landmark ruling by the European Court of Human Rights,
*  which found in April Switzerland violated the rights of older women by failing to impose
*  policies curbing the climate crisis. The group of women plaintiffs called the Swiss government's
*  response a betrayal. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, officials say at least 42 people were
*  killed by suspected rebels with the allied Democratic forces in the eastern province of North
*  Kivu. This comes as more than 80 people were killed in a shipwreck on Kwa River. The DRC has
*  far fewer paved roads than other nations, leading residents to more frequently travel by boat,
*  often in unsafe conditions. In Kuwait, at least 49 people were killed when a fire swept through an
*  overcrowded six-story building housing immigrant workers in the city of Mangath. Dozens more have
*  been hospitalized for burns and smoke in Malaysia. Most of the victims were Indian nationals.
*  Under Kuwait's Kfala system, foreign workers who make up the majority of the private sector
*  workforce have weak labor protections and are barred from forming unions. Argentina's Senate
*  has narrowly passed far-right libertarian President Javier Mele's highly contested reform bill.
*  As lawmakers debated the measure Wednesday, protesters outside the National Congress and
*  Buenos Aires were met with riot police who deployed tear gas and made multiple arrests,
*  among other things the bill imposes sweeping austerity and privatization measures and slashes
*  labor rights. Opposition Senator Martín Lesto spoke during Wednesday's debate.
*  This bill gives everything, instantly and forever, to the big companies,
*  and it tells pensioners to wait. The big companies get less taxes and tax stability for 30 years.
*  In the tax package, Argentina's biggest millionaires get less taxes and stability
*  for 15 years. The pensioners who contributed for 30 years don't even know how much money they'll
*  get next month. Among the planned spending cuts is the dissolution of the government office dealing
*  with gender violence. The head of that office, Claudia Barcia, resigned last week. The bill must
*  now go back to the lower house, which already approved an earlier version in April. The measure
*  could be fully approved later today. And in Ecuador, activists are holding two days of protest to
*  oppose plans by the government of Daniel Nuboa to cut fuel subsidies. This is Nelson Errazo,
*  leader of the General Union of Workers of Ecuador.
*  The homes of the workers cannot stand another blow to their economy. The measures adopted,
*  such as a rise in the value-added tax, caused an elevation to the already high cost of living.
*  Consequently, that incremented the price of fuel. This condemns most Ecuadorian households
*  to poverty and misery. And those are some of the headlines. This is Democracy Now!,
*  democracynow.org, the War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman. And I'm Nermeen Shaikh. Welcome to
*  our listeners and viewers across the country and around the world.
