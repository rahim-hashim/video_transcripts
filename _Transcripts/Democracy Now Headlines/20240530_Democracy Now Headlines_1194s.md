# Israel's Secret Undermining of the ICC to Derail War Crimes Charges

*  Early last week, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court made headlines
*  around the world when he announced he was seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Galant on war crimes charges over the
*  assault on Gaza.
*  In his official announcement, Karim Khan also issued a warning.
*  It is critical.
*  In this moment, that my office and all parts of the court continue to conduct our work
*  with full independence and impartiality.
*  And I insist that all attempts to impede, to intimidate or to improperly influence the
*  officials of this court cease immediately.
*  Khan did not specify what he was referring to regarding attempts to intimidate the court
*  or interfere with its work.
*  But a joint investigation by The Guardian and the Israeli news outlet 972 this week
*  reveals how Israel has run an almost decade-long secret war against the ICC in an attempt to
*  derail the court from filing war crimes charges against Israeli officials.
*  The report details how Israel surveilled, hacked, smeared and threatened top ICC officials,
*  including Khan and his predecessor, Fatou Ben Souda.
*  The investigation reveals that the former head of the Israeli Mossad, Yossi Cohen, personally
*  threatened Ben Souda, telling her, quote,
*  "'You should help us and let us take care of you.
*  You don't want to be getting into things that could compromise your security or that
*  of your family,' end quote.
*  The news outlets also report that Netanyahu took a close interest in the intelligence
*  operations against the ICC and was described by one intelligence source as being, quote,
*  obsessed with the intercepts about the case.
*  The Israeli newspaper Haaretz Today reports they were about to publish details about the
*  Israeli intelligence operations against the ICC two years ago, but an Israeli security
*  official blocked publication.
*  The Haaretz reporter, Gurmagiddo, writes he was summoned to the office of an Israeli security
*  official, was told if he published the story he would, quote,
*  "'suffer the consequences and get to know the interrogation rooms of the Israeli security
*  authorities from the inside,' end quote.
*  The arrest warrants sought by the ICC against Netanyahu and Gallant include starvation of
*  civilians as a method of warfare and extermination of Palestinians in Gaza.
*  Our first guest, Kenneth Ross, has a column in The Guardian newspaper published yesterday
*  that begins, "'I should not be surprised at the lawlessness of a government that bombs
*  and stars Palestinian civilians in Gaza, but I was still shocked by the shamelessness of
*  Israel's efforts to subvert the International Criminal Court's investigation of its war
*  crimes.'"
*  Ken Roth joins us here in our New York studio.
*  He's a visiting professor at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs,
*  served for nearly three decades as the executive director of Human Rights Watch.
*  Ken, welcome back to Democracy Now!
*  Good to be back.
*  So let's talk about the significance of this exposé.
*  Yossi Cohen, head of Mossad, the intelligence agency extremely close to Netanyahu, for
*  ten years leading this campaign to stop the ICC from bringing charges.
*  Can you talk about the significance of this and how it affected what Fatou Ben-Assouda
*  did, the previous ICC chief, and then Kareem Khan?
*  Well, first, this is a crime.
*  Kareem Khan made that clear.
*  I mean, when he issued that notice, that any effort to intimidate or retaliate against
*  prosecutorial staff will be an obstruction of justice, in essence.
*  I thought he was referring to Republican senators who had threatened severe sanctions if Israeli
*  officials are charged.
*  But he clearly also had in mind what the Israeli Mossad had been doing, mainly to his predecessor.
*  Now what's interesting is the Israelis clearly misjudged Fatou Ben-Assouda.
*  One person is quoted as saying they thought of her as, you know, basically merely black
*  and African, so who cares, as they put it.
*  But she's a tough woman, and she resisted these threats to her family, a sting operation
*  against her husband, and she didn't have to act to that point because the court authorized
*  the investigation to go forward in February 2021, near the end of Ben-Assouda's term in
*  June 2021.
*  So she could have just sat on it and let Kareem Khan, her successor, take over.
*  She didn't.
*  She actually opened the investigation a month later.
*  And so this really speaks to her bravery.
*  This effort backfired.
*  Now I think the most significant ongoing effect of this, if we think back last week, Antony
*  Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State, his main argument against Kareem Khan charging
*  Netanyahu and Galand is what's known as the principle of complementarity.
*  It's a rule under the court statute that the court should defer to genuine good faith national
*  prosecutions.
*  And Blinken basically said Israel's got a, you know, a sophisticated legal system.
*  Let them handle it.
*  What this shows is that this whole thing is a sham, that the Israeli investigations are
*  not about securing justice.
*  They're about obstructing justice.
*  And we've heard about this for years from Bet-Salim, for example, the leading Israeli
*  human rights group that calls these whitewash investigations.
*  You know, whenever there's some incident and there's international outrage, Israel announces
*  an investigation, you then never hear anything further.
*  But the announcement of the investigation pushes things off.
*  They did something very similar with the ICC.
*  They would listen in to what Bensouda or Khan were looking at.
*  And they would say, aha, they're interested in that incident.
*  You mean they would eavesdrop?
*  Yes, they would eavesdrop.
*  They would hack.
*  And they would, so they learned that the ICC prosecutor was interested in an incident,
*  and they would start an investigation.
*  And they would then send somebody in to the prosecutor's office and say, you don't need
*  to look at this, we've got an investigation going.
*  And it sounded as if they were on top of it all.
*  But in fact, these were purely reactive investigations.
*  They were not good faith investigations.
*  This whole hacking and surveillance and threatening incident gives the lie to Blinken's argument
*  that Karim Khan should defer to Israeli justice efforts.
*  These are not good faith justice efforts.
*  These are cover-up efforts.
*  And, Ken, if you could just put this in the context of, I mean, why would Israel go to
*  such extraordinary lengths to compromise the International Criminal Court?
*  If you could give us some background, because does the International Criminal Court have
*  any enforcement mechanism?
*  What is the symbolic weight of decisions taken by the court?
*  If you could place this in the broader context of what decisions and investigations and prosecutions
*  the ICC has launched and made before, and explain in that context why Israel has done
*  this decade-long attempt to subvert the court's work.
*  Well, the International Criminal Court is the world's leading war crimes tribunal, in
*  essence.
*  And nobody wants to be charged with war crimes or crimes against humanity, as both Netanyahu
*  and Gallant are about to be done, because the prosecutors requested arrest warrants
*  based on basically starvation charges in Gaza.
*  And no one wants that, first of all, because it means that if you travel to any ICC country,
*  including all of Europe, including in more than 100 governments around the world, they
*  have a duty to arrest you and send you to the Hague for trial.
*  So there are real consequences, and you can end up in prison.
*  So nobody wants that.
*  And that's why Netanyahu was seen as obsessed with this, because it's not as if what goes
*  on in Gaza or even the West Bank are low-level operations.
*  These are very much directed from the top.
*  Netanyahu is commander-in-chief.
*  And so he understood his criminal liability, and he seemed determined not to change the
*  Not to say, oh, my goodness, are we committing war crimes in Gaza?
*  Let me stop that right away.
*  You know, no.
*  He just, you know, let it keep going and tried to obstruct the investigation that might lead
*  to his prosecution for war crimes.
*  And if you could say—I mean, it was in 1998, July 1998, that the Rome Statute of the International
*  Criminal Court was adopted.
*  The vote was 120 to 721 countries abstained.
*  The seven countries that voted against the treaty were China, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Qatar,
*  the U.S., and Yemen.
*  And Israel's opposition was reportedly stemming from the inclusion in the list of war crimes
*  of, quote, the action of transferring population into occupied territory.
*  And that's effectively what's happened.
*  Well, what we're speaking to now is something that has been going on long before the Gaza
*  War.
*  The settlements are war crimes.
*  They violate Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits an occupying power
*  from transferring its population to occupied territory.
*  And the ICC statute, the Rome Statute, codifies that crime.
*  So Israel has been vulnerable to this charge.
*  It still is vulnerable to this charge.
*  I would like to see Kareem Khan bring that charge at some stage, because it's a straightforward
*  case.
*  You know, there's no complicated facts behind it.
*  It's just happening out in the open.
*  So that is a vulnerability.
*  The U.S. opposed, you know, partly because of that, but also the U.S. was concerned with
*  what's known as territorial jurisdiction, the fact that the court has the power to prosecute
*  somebody for crimes committed on the territory of a court member, even if the person's own
*  country has never ratified the court's treaty.
*  Now, the U.S. hated that because it could mean that, you know, Americans are vulnerable.
*  And indeed, there was an investigation that Fatoub and Suda opened in Afghanistan that
*  threatened Bush-error torturers.
*  But the U.S. gave up on that objection because it was territorial jurisdiction that the court
*  used to prosecute Putin in Ukraine.
*  And Biden said that was justified.
*  In fact, you know, Lindsey Graham, the leading Republican senator, led a unanimous resolution
*  in the Senate that affirmed this use of territorial jurisdiction.
*  So that objection is gone.
*  They still say, oh, well, Palestine's not really a state.
*  But the court has addressed that already and said, you know, the U.N. General Assembly
*  found it to be a non-member observer state.
*  That's sufficient for it to ratify a whole host of humanized treaties that we should
*  welcome as well as the Rome Statute of the ICC.
*  So that objection is pretty much gone.
*  And that's why Antony Blinken fell back on this principle of complementarity.
*  You should defer to good faith Israeli investigations.
*  And what this latest Guardian 972 investigation shows is there is no good faith Israeli investigation.
*  There is a concerted, high-level effort to undermine justice, to protect Netanyahu, Gallant
*  and others from war crime charges.
*  I want to go back to Kareem Khan's predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, who announced in 2019 that
*  she intended to investigate alleged atrocities during Israel's 2014 war in Gaza.
*  She said at the time there was a, quote, reasonable basis to argue Israeli authorities are guilty
*  of war crimes, relocating Israeli civilians into the West Bank to live in settlements.
*  So that's Fatou Bensouda back in 2019.
*  She brought the show up in this case in 2021.
*  And I wanted to ask you more about her.
*  The Guardian writes, quote,
*  They went after her husband.
*  They went after her.
*  And then I want to ask you about the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo that the
*  Guardian reported on, Joseph Kabila, and how they used him.
*  This is an amazing meeting.
*  Well, first, Fatou Bensouda is a tough woman.
*  I met with her numerous times.
*  She is super professional.
*  She is dedicated to justice.
*  She knew she was facing threats.
*  And she just persisted.
*  And that's really to her credit.
*  I think the Israelis totally underestimated her.
*  They thought that she could be pushed over with these threats, and it totally didn't
*  happen.
*  Now, Joseph Kabila, the Congolese president, is an interesting case.
*  I've met with him multiple times.
*  On the one hand, he handed over more suspects to the ICC than any other president in the
*  world.
*  So he is somebody who Bensouda legitimately was meeting with.
*  But the Mossad head, wanting to meet with Bensouda, knowing that she would not accept
*  a meeting just like that, probably paid off Kabila.
*  I mean, who knows?
*  But Kabila is notoriously corrupt.
*  And so Bensouda's meeting with Kabila and impops the head of the Mossad, which Kabila
*  authorized.
*  They called it an ambush.
*  And that was how the head of the Mossad set up an opportunity to communicate with Bensouda.
*  And am I surprised that Kabila would do this?
*  No.
*  But that was the kind of underhanded methods that the Israeli Mossad chief used to try
*  to begin the process of threatening Bensouda.
*  Wasn't Kabila himself being investigated for war crimes or atrocities and war?
*  Kabila was vulnerable for, for example, his force of shooting at demonstrators when he
*  was trying to hang on to the presidency beyond the end of his term.
*  But in fact, he was never the subject of a major ICC investigation.
*  Those were mostly focused on groups in eastern Congo, where he was, I think, doing what he
*  could to stop it.
*  So I don't think he felt threatened by the ICC and had a cooperative relationship with
*  Bensouda.
*  And then talk about what happened to Al Haq and how they were eavesdropped on when they
*  would relate to—this is the Ramallah-based human rights group—and ultimately being
*  called a terrorist organization.
*  Well, Al Haq is a super-respected Palestinian human rights group.
*  I've worked with them for decades.
*  In fact, I just did a webinar yesterday with its head.
*  And they were communicating regularly with the ICC, because they have field operatives
*  throughout the West Bank and Gaza.
*  They would collect solid evidence, and they would pass it on to the ICC, because they
*  wanted to see Israeli war crimes prosecuted.
*  The Israelis learned about this because they were monitoring Bensouda's communications
*  with all Palestinians.
*  And essentially in retaliation, the Israelis called Al Haq and five of its colleague organizations
*  terrorist organizations, a label that, you know, remains there to this day.
*  Now, they haven't actually shut them down, but it was an effort to say, these are illegitimate
*  groups, you know, don't rely on them.
*  And it was a punishment to them, in essence, for cooperating with the ICC.
*  Well, Israel is intensifying its attacks.
*  So if we could just go to what's unfolding at the moment.
*  Israel is intensifying its attack on the southern city of Ra'a.
*  On Tuesday, the White House said that Israel's devastating airstrike on a tent camp for displaced
*  Palestinians in Ra'a does not cross President Biden's so-called red line in Gaza.
*  Sunday's attack, which set off a fire in the camp, killed 45 Palestinians and injured
*  over 200, mostly women and children.
*  An investigation by CNN found Israel attacked the camp using munitions made in the United
*  States by Boeing.
*  White House national security spokesperson John Kirby was questioned Tuesday by Ed O'Keefe
*  of CBS News.
*  How does this not violate the red line that the president laid out?
*  As I said, we don't want to see a major ground operation.
*  We haven't seen that at this point.
*  How many more charred corpses does he have to see before the president considers a change
*  of policy?
*  We don't want to see a single more innocent life taken.
*  And I kind of take a little offense at the question.
*  No civilian casualties is the right number of civilian casualties.
*  And this is not something that we've turned a blind eye to, nor has it been something
*  we've ignored or neglected to raise with our Israeli counterparts, including Ed, this weekend
*  as a result of this particular strike.
*  Now, they're investigating it, so let them investigate it and see what they come up with.
*  So, Ken, if you could respond to Kirby's response and then overall the Biden administration's
*  position on this and, in fact, on the ICC, which you referred to earlier.
*  Well, Biden seems to have an endlessly moveable red line.
*  And he, you know, rightly at the rhetorical level, keeps pushing the Israeli government
*  to allow in food and other humanitarian supplies, to take greater care, not to harm Israeli
*  civilians.
*  It's all the right thing to say.
*  He never backs it up.
*  The only consequence he's imposed so far has been he did stop delivery of these huge 2,000-pound
*  bombs that Israel was using to decimate entire neighborhoods.
*  And he didn't want that to happen in Ra'atva.
*  So that's to his credit.
*  But then he turned around and authorized $1 billion in additional arms sales to Israel.
*  So that really kind of undercut the message there.
*  They've been saying, you know, we don't want this Ra'atva operation to harm civilians.
*  But Israel has now chased 1 million out of the 1.4 million Palestinian sheltering in
*  Ra'atva out of the city.
*  And most of them are, you know, trying to survive on this beachfront camp with no food,
*  no sanitation facilities, no medical aid, nothing.
*  And it was near that area that this latest bomb that killed 45 people took place.
*  But the International Court of Justice last week said, these are horrendous conditions.
*  This is not a safe response to this Ra'atva military operation.
*  But Biden's closing his eyes to that and says, we haven't seen any real problems yet.
*  You know, it's proceeding.
*  So the red line keeps moving.
*  And what do you think, finally, Ken, what do you think is going to come out of this
*  investigation, the Guardian and 972 investigation and revelations about what Israel did to subvert
*  the work of the ICC?
*  Well, it'll be interesting to see whether Karim Kahn does in fact use Article 70 of
*  the Rome Statute to prosecute, you know, in essence, obstruction of justice.
*  You know, the sense I got from his statement a week and a half ago was that he was not
*  going to apply that retroactively, but if anything like this happens again, he would
*  use it.
*  I think the most significant effect will be that, you know, Israel is going to try to
*  defend itself using this principle of complementarity, saying we're investigating ourselves.
*  And I think the real effect of this investigation is to really undermine the credibility of
*  any self-investigation claim.
