**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=6.84s)]
*  Protests continued in Los Angeles Monday as the Trump administration announced it's [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=7.84s)]
*  sending 700 Marines to the city. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=11.48s)]
*  They're expected to arrive in L.A. by this evening, deployed from nearby Camp Pendleton, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=14.48s)]
*  in addition to another 2,000 National Guard who were sent to crackdown on protests that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=19.04s)]
*  erupted over a wave of ICE raids across L.A., bringing the total National Guard presence [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=24.16s)]
*  in L.A. to 4,000. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=29.7s)]
*  California has filed a lawsuit in response to Trump's deployment of National Guard [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=31.94s)]
*  and Marine forces, which Governor Gavin Newsom called a quote, blatant abuse of power. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=36.42s)]
*  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass accused the Trump administration of fomenting chaos and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=42.06s)]
*  making L.A. a test case for imposing authoritarian rule against more U.S. cities. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  We need to stop the raids. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=52.72s)]
*  This should not be happening in our city. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=55.7s)]
*  It is not warranted, and it does any—the only thing it does is contribute to chaos. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=58.42s)]
*  This was chaos that was started in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=64.5s)]
*  On Thursday, the city was peaceful. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=68.54s)]
*  On Friday, it was not, because of the intervention of the federal government. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=70.86s)]
*  And it's, again, I don't think our city should be a test case, a laboratory. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=76.06s)]
*  We will speak with California's Attorney General Rob Bonta, who brought lawsuits against [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=81.46000000000001s)]

*  David Huerta, head of the SEIU, the Service Employees International Union in California, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=88.38s)]
*  was released on bond Monday following his arrest by ICE Friday, which provoked widespread [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  outrage. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=99.78s)]
*  Huerta was charged with conspiring to impede an officer, which could result in a six-year [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=100.78s)]
*  federal prison sentence if convicted. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=106.17999999999999s)]
*  Huerta called for a justice for all detained immigrants following his release. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=108.7s)]
*  So, I just want to say that while we're here and there's protests outside, that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=113.82000000000001s)]
*  means in there, they're in lockdown right now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=120.94000000000001s)]
*  They're in lockdown. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=124.66000000000001s)]
*  They cannot come out of their cells. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=126.10000000000001s)]
*  Not even to eat. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=129.02s)]

*  plant that was raided by ICE Friday. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=139.5s)]

*  This whole country boasts about being the best. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=146.18s)]
*  But how can we claim that if we can't uphold basic human rights and due process? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  I also want to ask, where is the sanctuary California promised us, when our police departments [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=153.02s)]
*  choose to defend ICE officials instead of its own people? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCxOUmPlssU&t=157.5s)]
