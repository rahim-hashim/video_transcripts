**Democracy Now Headlines:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqwEolvv7O0)

*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In Lebanon, at least 25 people were killed, more than 600 others wounded on Wednesday,
*  when more handheld electronic devices exploded without warning.
*  were of walkie-talkies, but there are also reports of mobile phones, laptops, even solar
*  panels suddenly exploding.
*  The blast sowed further panic across Beirut and southern Lebanon one day after some 4,000
*  pagers exploded simultaneously, killing 12 people and leaving thousands more with gruesome
*  injuries.
*  Wednesday's explosions triggered fires that engulfed homes, stores, cars and motorcycles.
*  Some of the blasts occurred during the funeral of 9-year-old Fatima Abdullah, who was killed
*  in Tuesday's pager attack.
*  Lebanon has banned pagers and walkie-talkies on all flights, while Lebanese citizens say
*  they now live in fear every day household electronics could suddenly explode.
*  It's widely believed Israel is behind the attacks.
*  This is Lebanese politician Ahmad Hariri.
*  The Lebanese people must be aware of what the Israeli enemy aims to achieve.
*  They want to sow discord among us or strike Lebanon at a time when international attention
*  is focused on the upcoming American elections.
*  This suggests that the Israeli army might be preparing to execute a malicious plan to
*  strike Lebanon like they struck Gaza.
*  The New York Times reports the electronic pagers had been manufactured by a company
*  in Hungary, BAC Consulting, that was actually a front company run by Israeli intelligence
*  officers.
*  Many of the pagers were obtained earlier this year after Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah
*  warned against using cell phones to avoid Israeli surveillance.
*  On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres warned nations against weaponizing
*  civilian objects.
*  The logic of making all these devices explode is to do it as a preemptive strike before
*  a major military operation.
*  So as important as the event in itself is the indication that this event confirms that
*  there is a serious risk of a dramatic escalation in Lebanon and everything must be done to
*  This all comes as Israel's declared its launching a new phase of war, redirecting forces from
*  Gaza to Israel's northern border with Lebanon.
*  But Israel's carnage in Gaza continues with deadly attacks reported today in Rafah and
*  Jabalia while many children were injured in Israeli quadcopter attack on Nusadat.
*  Rescue workers are rushing to uncover possible survivors buried under rubble in the barrage
*  camp.
*  The late President, Yonis, a father, mourned the loss of nearly his entire family to an
*  Israeli strike, including his three children.
*  His youngest was just a year and a half.
*  Come and see what did he do.
*  One year and nine months old.
*  What did he do?
*  Did he fire a rocket?
*  He was sitting safe amongst us.
*  Look, people.
*  Look, whole world.
*  One year and nine months old.
*  Look at how my son is.
*  The Palestinian Health Ministry said Wednesday Dr. Ziad Mohammed Al-Dalu, who was abducted
*  by Israeli forces during its march raid on Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital, has died in an
*  Israeli jail.
*  He is the third doctor to die in Israeli custody since October 7th and one of at least 60 Palestinians
*  who have since perished in Israeli prisons, which are rife with abuse and torture.
*  The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution Wednesday demanding Israel end
*  its illegal occupation of Palestinian territories within a year.
*  124 countries vote in favor of the nonbinding resolution.
*  Israel and the United States were among the 12 member states to vote no.
*  It was the first resolution formally introduced by the state of Palestine, since it took a
*  permanent seat in the General Assembly last week.
*  In Washington, D.C., independent Senator Bernie Sanders is preparing a joint resolution
*  of disapproval against a plan $20 billion in U.S. arms sales to Israel.
*  He spoke from the Senate floor Wednesday.
*  Netanyahu's policies have trampled on international law, made life unlivable in Gaza and created
*  one of the worst humanitarian disasters in modern history.
*  The simple fact is that we must end our complicity in Israel's illegal and indiscriminate military
*  campaign which has caused mass civilian death and suffering.
*  Meanwhile, Reuters is reporting that Germany appears to have put a hold on new exports
*  of weapons to Israel amidst ongoing legal challenges.
*  In campaign news here in the United States, the Teamsters Union says it is not endorsing
*  a presidential candidate for the first time since 1996.
*  The union, which endorsed Biden in 2020, says neither candidate had enough support from
*  their 1.3 million-strong membership.
*  Teamsters President Sean O'Brien in July addressed the Republican National Convention
*  in a first for the union.
*  But Kamala Harris on Wednesday did gain support of more than 100 former Republican officials,
*  including ex-Congress members, defense secretaries, CIA directors and others, who declared in
*  an open letter that Trump is, quote, unfit to serve again as president.
*  Over a dozen House Republicans joined Democrats on Wednesday in rejecting Republican Speaker
*  Mike Johnson's six-month government spending bill.
*  The stopgap bill would have tied $1.6 trillion in government funding to a measure requiring
*  states to ask residents for proof of citizenship when registering to vote.
*  Hours before Wednesday's House vote, Donald Trump called on Republicans to reject any
*  spending package that does not include the voter suppression measure.
*  If no bill is passed before the end of the month, the federal government will shut down
*  on October 1st when early voting will be underway for November's election.
*  Vice President Kamala Harris spoke Wednesday to Congressional Hispanic Caucus event warning
*  of mass deportations and massive detention camps if Trump is re-elected.
*  Donald Trump and his extremist allies will keep trying to pull us backward.
*  We all remember what they did to tear families apart.
*  And now they have pledged to carry out the largest deportation, a mass deportation, in
*  American history.
*  Imagine what that would look like and what that would be.
*  How's that going to happen?
*  Massive raids?
*  Massive detention camps?
*  Immigrant rights advocates have blasted Harris for adopting the same hardline stance on immigration
*  as her Republican rivals and her focus on criminalizing immigrants and militarizing
*  the border.
*  The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point,
*  the Fed's first rate cut since March 2020.
*  Progressive economists and labor leaders praised the Fed's move but said it came far too
*  late for many households.
*  The AFL-CIO said in a statement, quote,
*  Last week, the U.S. Census Bureau reported the child poverty rate is more than doubled
*  since Congress allowed expanded pandemic benefits to expire, including the child tax credit,
*  leaving millions of families with less money for essentials like rent and food.
*  In Tunisia, authorities led by Qaisaed have accelerated a crackdown on opposition candidates
*  in peaceful protests ahead of presidential elections scheduled for October 6.
*  Amidst the international reports, at least 97 members of an opposition party were arrested
*  in recent days as authorities continued to restrict the work of journalists, human rights
*  defenders and NGOs while further undermining the independence of Tunisia's judiciary.
*  The latest raids began last Friday when thousands of protesters rallied in Tunis to demand the
*  release of political prisoners and an end to Qaisaed's authoritarian rule.
*  In Mali, the government has regained control over the capital city, Bamako, after repelling
*  several attacks by al-Qaeda-affiliated insurgents.
*  On Tuesday, gunmen attacked a military police center and battled Russian mercenaries with
*  the Wagner Group at an air base near Bamako's airport.
*  Malian officials have not confirmed a death toll.
*  It's the first attack by armed groups on Bamako since 2016, and the first since Mali's
*  military rulers expelled troops from Mali's former colonial ruler, France.
*  Bamako residents fear more attacks could be imminent.
*  There is no sense of security the way the camp was attacked.
*  If we didn't have seasoned soldiers, the terrorists would have taken it.
*  And then, what about us civilians?
*  And here in New York, protesters are demanding an end to police presence in the city's
*  subway system as anger mounts over Sunday's shooting of four people by a New York police
*  officer who was pursuing a suspected fare evader.
*  One of two bystanders shot remains hospitalized in critical condition.
*  On Tuesday, police arrested 18 people as they protested at the Sutter Avenue L Station in
*  Brooklyn where the shooting took place.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
