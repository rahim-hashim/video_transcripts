**Democracy Now Headlines:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVmFs6W6W4I)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  At least 17 Palestinians, including an 11-month-old baby, were killed today in Gaza's Nusayrat
*  camp as Israel once again attacked a school-turned shelter in central Deir Ebalah.
*  In northern Gaza, Al Jazeera reports many civil defense rescue workers are refusing
*  orders to evacuate facing arrest and attacks as they continue their rescue missions, even
*  as their capacity has been nearly wiped out by Israel's assault.
*  Israel's siege on northern Gaza, now in its 20th day, has killed over 770 Palestinians.
*  This is a displaced Palestinian woman who fled Beit Lahiya.
*  I fled the intense bombardment in Beit Lahiya.
*  Martyrs and remains were all scattered on the ground.
*  We do not know where to go.
*  Truly, we don't know what state we have reached.
*  We cannot take it anymore.
*  We are being exterminated in Gaza.
*  We are dying, and no one is standing beside us, nor is anyone able to solve our issue.
*  We are innocent.
*  We have nothing to do with everything that has happened.
*  We are lost between a war and an extermination.
*  Al Jazeera has blasted Israel's dangerous escalation of its attack against the news
*  network after the Israeli military claimed six of its journalists are members of Hamas
*  and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
*  Al Jazeera responded, quote, These fabricated accusations are a blatant attempt to silence
*  the few remaining journalists in the region, thereby obscuring the harsh realities of the
*  war from audiences worldwide, they said.
*  Israel will speak with the head of the Committee to Protect Journalists later in the broadcast.
*  Israel is continuing its assault on Lebanon, carrying out 17 attacks on Beirut's southern
*  suburbs overnight, leveling at least six buildings.
*  One strike destroyed the offices of the Lebanese news station El Mayadeen.
*  Israel also killed three Lebanese soldiers in a separate strike.
*  Meanwhile, health authorities are warning of a possible cholera outbreak among Lebanese
*  children amidst mass displacement, attacks on the health system and lack of clean water
*  and food.
*  The 400,000 displaced children in Lebanon are also at risk of other highly transmissible
*  diseases like hepatitis A and measles.
*  In France, President Emmanuel Macron pledged a 100 million euro aid package for Lebanon
*  as he opened a conference in Paris to rally support for Lebanon and reiterate calls for
*  a ceasefire.
*  We'll go to Beirut for the latest after headlines.
*  Here in the United States, Jewish students across the country say college administrators
*  have cracked down on their Gaza Solidarity Sukkas, which have been set up over the past
*  week to mark the holiday of Sukkot.
*  In some cases, schools have destroyed the Sukkah huts.
*  Jewish Voice for Peace said in a statement, quote,
*  These universities desecrate these students' Jewish practice because their faith is intertwined
*  with their solidarity with the Palestinian people.
*  A university has no right to dictate what types of Jewish practice are legitimate, they
*  said.
*  Here in New York City, faith leaders and other activists disrupted a city council meeting
*  Wednesday to demand council members take up a vote on the Gaza ceasefire resolution.
*  Protesters cried out, City Council, you can't hide, no more bombs for genocide.
*  As they held up their hands covered in red paint while being forcibly removed by security.
*  Over 100 city councils across the United States have passed ceasefire resolutions.
*  In Spain, over 300 academics, entertainers, artists, including the directors Pedro Omadova
*  and Isabel Crochet, have signed on to a letter calling on Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez
*  to enact a full arms embargo against Israel, writing, quote,
*  Sanchez has said Spain halted its weapons trade with Israel since October of last year,
*  but investigations have revealed some military exports have still gone ahead.
*  Turkey's military launched dozens of airstrikes across northern Iraq and Syria Wednesday in
*  what the Turkish Defense Ministry said were attacks on positions held by the Kurdish PKK
*  militia.
*  The strikes came hours after officials in Ankara blamed the PKK for setting off explosives
*  at the state-run aerospace company TUSAS, then opening fire, killing at least five people
*  and injuring 22 others.
*  No group has claimed responsibility.
*  Eight agencies in eastern Chad are warning of deteriorating conditions in overcrowded
*  camps for more than half a million Sudanese refugees who fled fighting between rival military
*  factions since the outbreak of war in April 2023.
*  The conflict has uprooted more than 11 million people across Sudan, with 26 million facing
*  severe food insecurity.
*  About 25,000 refugees from Sudan crossed into Chad in the first week of October alone.
*  Those settling in refugee camps face poor living conditions, severe cuts to food rations
*  and few job prospects.
*  Meanwhile, the U.N. says Sudan's warring factions continue to commit human rights violations,
*  including possible war crimes and crimes against humanity.
*  This is U.N. spokesperson Farhan Haq.
*  Kamala Harris's presidential campaign and allied groups raised $378 million in September,
*  hoping to break the record for the largest quarterly campaign fundraising haul in U.S.
*  history.
*  This, according to the new Federal Election Commission data.
*  Major Harris donors include Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, Illinois billionaire Democratic
*  Governor J.B. Pritzker and cryptocurrency billionaire Chris Larson.
*  The New York Times reports billionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates recently donated about
*  $50 million to a nonprofit-backing Harris.
*  Michael Bloomberg also has spent tens of millions on the Harris campaign.
*  Donald Trump's campaign reports it raised $160 million in September.
*  That includes over $14 million from a handful of oil and gas industry executives coming
*  after Trump told fossil fuel companies he would roll back environmental protections
*  in exchange for $1 billion in campaign contributions.
*  On Wednesday, Trump rallied supporters in Duluth, Georgia, where he was introduced by
*  the far-right TV personality Tucker Carlson, who compared Trump to an angry father whose
*  children deserve to be spanked.
*  And when dad gets home, you know what he says?
*  You've been a bad girl.
*  You've been a bad little girl, and you're getting a vigorous spanking right now.
*  Trump was later welcomed to the stage as the crowd chanted,
*  Daddy's home, Daddy's home.
*  At the Georgia rally, Trump did not mention recent statements from his former chief of
*  staff, retired Marine General John Kelly, who told the New York Times Trump made admiring
*  comments about Adolf Hitler and would govern like a dictator if allowed.
*  On Wednesday, Kamala Harris said she agrees with Kelly that Trump is a fascist.
*  Donald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable.
*  And in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guardrails against
*  his propensities and his actions.
*  In other campaign news, the consumer advocacy Watchdog Public Citizen filed a complaint
*  with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday over Elon Musk's $1 million daily giveaway
*  to swing state voters.
*  So far, at least four people, two in Pennsylvania and one in North Carolina, have received checks
*  for $1 million.
*  The Justice Department has reportedly sent a warning to Elon Musk's super PAC over
*  the scheme.
*  Meanwhile, the outlet The Lever reports Elon Musk could benefit from a massive tax benefit
*  if Trump is re-elected and appoints Musk to a government position.
*  Trump has said he will create a new official role for Musk, secretary of cost-cutting.
*  This comes as a new analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy finds Kamala
*  Harris' tax proposals would overall increase taxes for the top 1 percent and lower them
*  for everyone else, while Trump's policies would cut taxes for the wealthiest 5 percent
*  and raise them for everyone else.
*  Donald Trump is facing a new accusation of sexual misconduct.
*  Stacey Williams worked as a model in 1993 when she says Donald Trump repeatedly groped
*  her at Trump Tower.
*  She was introduced to Trump by the now-deceased serial sexual predator and trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.
*  Williams described the assault as a twisted game that had been orchestrated by Trump and Epstein.
*  Trump's campaign denied the allegations.
*  Boeing workers on the West Coast are extending their six-week-long strike after rejecting
*  a proposed contract on Wednesday.
*  Earlier in the day, Boeing reported a $6.1 billion loss.
*  The deal, which was rejected by 64 percent of voters, included a 35 percent wage increase
*  over four years.
*  Striking workers are demanding a 40 percent raise in the reinstatement of their defined
*  benefit pension plan.
*  This is a Boeing Machinist speaking ahead of the vote.
*  I think it's a decent contract, but I think it's not what we asked for.
*  And I feel like the contract, it's not going to push the company forward for longevity
*  in the long run.
*  There's a lot of new hires that are struggling.
*  There's even—I just feel like Boeing in this economy could do a lot better with all
*  the money that we've made for them over the years.
*  A new study by Ohio State University finds the U.S. infant mortality rate spiked after
*  the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, with hundreds more babies dying after
*  states moved to restrict or ban abortion access.
*  The largest increase came among infants with congenital anomalies or birth defects.
*  Researchers believe that's because pregnant people living under abortion bans can no longer
*  terminate pregnancies when fetal anomalies are detected in utero.
*  And Gustavo Gutierrez, the Peruvian priest known as the father of liberation theology,
*  has died at the age of 96.
*  Gutierrez wrote that poverty is, quote,
*  The School of Thought was popularized in Latin America through the 60s and 70s despite pushback
*  from the Vatican against liberation theology and its anchoring in Marxist principles.
*  They continued to spread and played a role in political movements, including the Sandinista
*  Revolution in Nicaragua.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
