We speak with Israeli journalist Gideon Levy after a young Israeli couple was shot dead in Washington, D.C. Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim both worked at the Israeli Embassy and were killed by a gunman after leaving the Capital Jewish Museum Wednesday night. The couple were dating and about to get engaged, the embassy said. Police identified Elias Rodriguez of Chicago as the suspect in custody. Video shows Rodriguez shouting "Free Palestine" during his arrest, and authorities are investigating the incident as a potential hate crime. 

"This incident can be only condemned. Nothing that Israel is doing can justify such a murder," says Levy. He adds that incidents like the Washington killings are adding to a growing sense inside Israel that "because of the war in Gaza, Israel is turning into a pariah state."

*  The journalist Ken Klippenstein posted what is believed to be a manifesto by the alleged [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=95.0s)]
*  gunman, Elias Rodriguez. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=100.04s)]
*  In the document, he praises Aaron Bushnell, the U.S. Air Force person who self-immolated [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=102.92s)]
*  last year in an act of protest outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  Rodriguez wrote, quote, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=113.72s)]
*  "'Aaron Bushnell and others sacrificed themselves in the hopes of stopping the massacre, and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  the state works to make us feel their sacrifice was made in vain, that there is no hope in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=119.48s)]
*  escalating for Gaza and no point in bringing the war home. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=124.16s)]
*  We can't let them succeed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  Their sacrifices were not made in vain.'" [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=129.2s)]
*  We go now to Tel Aviv, where we're joined by the Israeli journalist Gideon Levy, an [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=132.76s)]
*  award-winning Israeli journalist, author, columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, member [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=137.56s)]
*  of its editorial board. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  Gideon Levy's latest book is titled The Killing of Gaza, Reports on a Catastrophe. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=145.16000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us, Gideon. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=151.84s)]
*  If you could first respond to the killing of these two staffers, a couple who walked [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  outside of this U.S.-American Jewish Committee event at the Jewish Museum in Washington last [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=160.56s)]
*  night. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=166.52s)]
*  I mean, this incident can be only condemned. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=167.52s)]
*  Nothing that Israel is doing can justify such a murder. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=174.68s)]
*  It was a murder. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=178.12s)]
*  And unfortunately also, this kind of violence will not bring the Gaza war to its end. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  So it's tasteless, it's criminal, it's tragic, two young people being murdered. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  It doesn't serve anything, and it should be condemned and not justified by any, any, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=191.52s)]
*  anything. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  Nothing can justify it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  And Gideon, if you could just talk about what the preliminary response in Israel has been [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  and whether you anticipate anything happening as a direct consequence of this murder. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=204.44s)]
*  No, I don't expect anything in particular connected with this murder. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  But the general atmosphere in Israel starts to be realizing that because of the war in [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=219.2s)]
*  Gaza, Israel is turning into a pariah state. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  People start to digest it, start to understand that there will be a price for all the crimes, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=230.16s)]
*  for the mass killing, for the destruction. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=236.56s)]
*  And the longer this war will go on, the more damage will be made also to Israel. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  First, the main damage is obviously to the real direct victims in Gaza. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=245.6s)]
*  But also Israel is going to pay a price for running this war for so long with so little [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=249.84s)]
*  justification, legitimacy or purpose. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=258.08s)]
*  Well, Gideon, if you could talk about your latest column, Israel's military leaders are [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=261.32s)]
*  not only obeying orders, they could have stopped the Gaza massacre. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=266.44s)]
*  If you could elaborate on what you say in the piece. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=270.7s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=273.84s)]
*  There is a tendency, mainly among my friends in the Zionist left or in the central left [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=274.96s)]
*  of Israel, to put everything on the shoulders of the government, which is right to do, but [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=281.08s)]
*  to give some immunity to the army as if the army is still the old holy cow of Israel. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  I cannot accept it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  Because finally the children, almost 1000 babies, can you imagine yourself, almost 1000 [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=298.72s)]
*  babies in 19 months. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=305.16s)]
*  Not to speak about the 17,000 children. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=307.24s)]
*  They were killed by soldiers. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=310.48s)]
*  They were killed by pilots. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=312.44000000000005s)]
*  They were killed by people who have to take accountability for this. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=314.6s)]
*  Yes, the government decides about the policy and the government should be blamed for such [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=319.08000000000004s)]
*  a policy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=325.44000000000005s)]
*  But by the end of the day, we cannot say it's only the government. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=327.08s)]
*  Because the army did it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=331.64s)]
*  There are almost no refuseniks in this war, which is quite surprising. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  There are some, but very few, and for sure not public ones. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  And all the others are committing a criminal policy. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=343.12s)]
*  A policy with a black flag on it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=346.79999999999995s)]
*  A policy which is very clear does not meet any of the articles of the international law. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=349.79999999999995s)]
*  And therefore to say we don't attack the army, we don't criticize the army, it's [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=356.56s)]
*  only the government, is really doing our life too easy. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=361.4s)]
*  Yes, the army is very popular in Israel. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=365.6s)]
*  We have to break this militarism once and for all and say, yes, the government is to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=368.56s)]
*  be blamed, but so does the army. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=373.36s)]
*  Everyone who took part in this bloodbath should be taken accountable. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTQAiCYMuBw&t=377.36s)]
