*  Gaza's health ministry says the official death toll has topped 50,000, as Israel continues [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quXFqGr6G90&t=7.12s)]
*  to bombard and block Gaza. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quXFqGr6G90&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  But it's widely believed the actual death toll is far higher. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quXFqGr6G90&t=16.76s)]
*  On Sunday, Israeli forces bombed a surgical unit at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quXFqGr6G90&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  largest functioning hospital in Gaza. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quXFqGr6G90&t=26.6s)]
*  The attack killed two people, including Esmael Bakhm, a member of Hamas's political bureau. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quXFqGr6G90&t=30.0s)]
*  Hamas said he was at the hospital for treatment for injuries suffered in an earlier Israeli [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quXFqGr6G90&t=35.68s)]
*  strike. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quXFqGr6G90&t=40.28s)]

*  and said the teenager killed was his patient. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quXFqGr6G90&t=50.84s)]
*  You know, I've certainly never had a patient injured in an explosion, brought to the hospital, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quXFqGr6G90&t=55.0s)]
*  taken care of, doing well, ready to go home, and then blown up in his hospital bed. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quXFqGr6G90&t=62.6s)]
