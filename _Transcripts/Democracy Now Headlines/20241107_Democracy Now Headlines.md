# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” November 7, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zVsyyGiKpE)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, War, Peace and the Presidency.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Kamala Harris has conceded the 2024 presidential race to Donald Trump, promising a peaceful
*  transfer of power.
*  Harris addressed supporters Wednesday afternoon at her alma mater, Howard University, after
*  calling Trump to congratulate him.
*  In our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the
*  United States.
*  And loyalty to our conscience and to our God.
*  My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say, while I concede this election, I do
*  not concede the fight that fueled this campaign.
*  This is not a time to throw up our hands.
*  This is a time to roll up our sleeves.
*  With millions of ballots still to be counted, Trump is expected to match the 74 million
*  votes he received in 2020.
*  Kamala Harris, meanwhile, won just 68 million votes so far, lagging far behind Joe Biden's
*  performance in 2020 when he got 81 million votes, the vast majority of the 3,000-plus
*  counties across the United States, whether urban, suburban or rural, swung right in this
*  year's election.
*  Control over the House of Representatives remains up for grabs, with dozens of races
*  yet to be called.
*  So far, Republicans have claimed 206 House seats compared to Democrats' 191.
*  Whichever party reaches 218 will hold the majority and can determine who becomes House
*  Speaker.
*  Meanwhile, Republicans have increased their control over the Senate after winning a majority
*  of seats for the first time since 2020.
*  In Montana, incumbent Democratic Senator John Tester has lost his reelection bid, flipping
*  another Senate seat for Republicans.
*  He was defeated by Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL endorsed by Donald Trump.
*  Sheehy gets an A rating from the National Rifle Association as strongly anti-abortion.
*  Earlier this year, Montana's Charcusta News published audio clips of Sheehy at campaign
*  events making racist and highly offensive comments about Native Americans.
*  In Nevada, Democratic Senator Jackie Rosen will hold on to her seat after fending off
*  a challenge from Republican Sam Brown.
*  Rosen's a former synagogue president, first elected to the Senate in 2018.
*  In Michigan, Democratic Congressmember Lisa Slotkin has narrowly won an open U.S. Senate
*  seat, defeating Republican Mike Rogers.
*  Slotkin is a former Middle East analyst for the CIA, who served three terms in Iraq under
*  George W. Bush.
*  She also worked as a high-ranking Pentagon official under President Obama.
*  Puerto Rico's non-voting member of Congress, Republican Jennifer Gonzalez, is set to become
*  the island's next governor.
*  She's a supporter of statehood for Puerto Rico and a Trump supporter.
*  She's on track to narrowly beat Juan Del Mao of the Alianza Coalition.
*  The center-left third-party group made history gains in this year's election, with Puerto
*  Rican voters disaffected with the two main parties.
*  The world's richest person, Elon Musk, saw his net worth soar by over $16 billion Wednesday
*  after Donald Trump secured victory.
*  His net worth is now estimated at $290 billion.
*  Musk personally spent about $120 million helping Trump get elected and used his social
*  media site, X, formerly Twitter, to promote Trump's campaign.
*  On Tuesday, Musk wrote, quote, "'Men are voting in record numbers.
*  They now realize everything is at stake.'"
*  Musk was echoing Republican talking points aimed at countering Kamala Harris's support
*  among women and voter dissatisfaction with abortion bans.
*  Trump vowed to install Musk as head of a new government efficiency commission.
*  Musk has proposed cuts of at least $2 trillion to federal spending.
*  Meanwhile, CNN and Politico are reporting Trump has tapped Brian Hook, a top State Department
*  official during the first Trump administration, to begin staffing the State Department.
*  Hook served as special envoy for Iran under Trump, leading the maximum-pressure campaign
*  of sanctions, sabotage and assassinations against Tehran.
*  Federal counsel Jack Smith is reportedly preparing to wind down his two federal criminal cases
*  against Donald Trump in line with Justice Department policy that shields a sitting president
*  from prosecution.
*  Smith charged Trump with election subversion and illegally retaining classified documents.
*  During campaigning, Trump said he would fire Smith within two seconds if he was re-elected.
*  Meanwhile, Trump's lawyers are expected to ask New York judge Juan Marchand to delay
*  sentencing in Trump's New York hush money and election interference trial.
*  Trump's sentencing on 34 felony counts was postponed earlier this year to November 26th.
*  George's sweeping election subversion case against Trump is also at risk of being delayed
*  due to his re-election.
*  Immigrant communities across the U.S. and asylum seekers near the U.S. border are trying
*  to figure out what an incoming Trump administration will mean for their safety and their rights.
*  This is immigrant rights activist Jose Garcia, who works with asylum seekers in Tijuana.
*  For us, the concerns here in the North is that the migrant communities will be stuck.
*  However, we will also see many migrants wanting to cross irregularly based on the fact that
*  these aid programs are going to be removed.
*  People will risk more to want to cross irregularly at the various points in our border areas.
*  It is a latent risk where they can be robbed, assaulted, where they can be abandoned to
*  their fate, and in a moment, they can even lose their lives.
*  We'll have more on immigration later in the broadcast with Stanford professor Ana
*  Raquel Minyan.
*  The Israeli military says Palestinians from northern Gaza will not be allowed to return
*  effectively admitting to ethnically cleansing the region.
*  A military official said any future aid to Gaza would only be allowed to enter through
*  the South, but not the North, where there are, quote, no more civilians left, unquote.
*  UNRWA spokesperson Louise Wateridge posted a harrowing video from northern Gaza showing
*  its utter decimation.
*  Wateridge wrote, quote, no matter from what direction you enter, homes, hospitals, schools,
*  health clinics, mosques, apartments, restaurants, all completely flattened, an entire society
*  now a graveyard, unquote.
*  This comes as the head of UNRWA warned once again the agency will collapse, quote, without
*  intervention by member states.
*  Reuters reports the UN suggested in a letter to Israel that replacing the aid provided
*  by UNRWA would become Israel's responsibility after it recently cut ties with the UN agency.
*  Meanwhile, the World Health Organization resumed large-scale medical evacuations Wednesday
*  moving over 100 critical patients out of Gaza.
*  Fewer than 300 patients had been able to leave Gaza since Israel blocked the Ra'afa
*  crossing in May.
*  The WHO estimates up to 14,000 Palestinians are in need of urgent medical evacuation from Gaza.
*  Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed at least 27 Palestinians since the day started, including
*  at least three children in Ra'afa.
*  In Lebanon, residents of Beirut woke up to smoke-filled skies this morning after a night
*  of Israeli bombardment targeting the capital's southern neighborhoods.
*  This followed deadly Israeli strikes on the eastern Beqa Valley and the city of Baalbek,
*  which killed at least 40 people and wounded 50 on Wednesday.
*  Hezbollah said it launched a series of attack drones at the Bilou military base south of
*  Tel Aviv in response to the latest attacks.
*  Lebanese residents of Beirut continue to condemn Israel's escalating assault on Lebanon.
*  This is a savage, predatory enemy that destroys homes, kills people and kills civilization.
*  It cannot defeat the Hezbollah party.
*  It cannot defeat them with destroying civilizations, with destroying homes, with anything.
*  It cannot defeat them.
*  And I say to Hezbollah, do not stop.
*  Do not stop resisting this enemy.
*  I mean, what is taken away by force must return by force, too.
*  Meanwhile, Lebanon has filed a complaint at the U.N.'s International Labor Organization
*  over Israel's September terror attack, in which 4,000 people were killed or wounded
*  when their pagers suddenly exploded across Lebanon.
*  Russia ratified a mutual defense pact with North Korea Wednesday, solidifying the military
*  alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang.
*  This comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned of a, quote,
*  "...new chapter of instability," after revealing his troops fought North Korean soldiers on
*  the battlefield for the first time.
*  The combat reportedly took place earlier this week in Russia's Kursk region, though
*  South Korea downplayed the encounter, labeling it an incident involving a small number of fighters.
*  Ukraine says some 11,000 North Korean soldiers are now stationed in Kursk, where Ukraine
*  launched a surprise counter-invasion in August.
*  Germany's governing coalition collapsed Wednesday, after Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired
*  his finance minister following failed talks between the three ruling parties.
*  Scholz said he'll remain in office but called for a confidence vote January 15th, which
*  could lead to fresh elections by the end of March.
*  I will now very quickly seek a conversation with the opposition leader, Friedrich Merze.
*  I would like to offer him to work constructively together on two issues, or more, which are
*  important for our country, the quick strengthening of our economy and our defense.
*  Our economy can't wait until a snap election takes place.
*  The Pakistani province of Punjab is asking people to stay home as much as possible, halting
*  in-person schooling and setting up a so-called smog war room in an effort to tackle record
*  levels of air pollution that have choked the region.
*  Hospitals report a spike in patients with respiratory and other smog-related conditions.
*  The air quality index in Lahore recently soared as high as 120 times over recommended levels.
*  I'm struggling with shortness of breath and watery eyes, likely from poor air quality.
*  I'll stay home until it's safe to venture out.
*  Government officials say they're investigating ways to mitigate the pollution, including
*  inducing artificial rainfall.
*  This suffocating smog is brought about by a combination of crop burning, vehicular and
*  industrial emissions and colder air.
*  In Southern California, 14,000 people in Ventura County have been told to evacuate as firefighters
*  battle the fast-moving mountain fire.
*  Thereby, another wildfire, the broadfire in Malibu, also erupted Wednesday amidst the
*  dry conditions and strong winds.
*  Forecasters say the rest of the week could bring extremely critical wildfire danger to
*  the region.
*  And Cuba's power grid collapsed again on Wednesday, as Hurricane Rafael lashed the
*  island nation with torrential rains and sustained winds of 115 miles per hour.
*  The decades-long U.S.-led embargo on Cuba has left Cuba unable to update its ailing
*  energy infrastructure or import enough fuel and food for its residents.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, War, Peace and the Presidency.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  And I'm Nermeen Shaikh.
*  Welcome to our listeners and viewers across the country and around the world.
