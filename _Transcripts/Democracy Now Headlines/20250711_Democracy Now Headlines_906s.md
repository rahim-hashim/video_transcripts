# U.N. Human Rights Chief Slams Trump's Anti-Immigrant Policies, "Militarized Response" to Protests
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=2.96s)]
*  We end today's show with U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  I spoke to him last week when I went to Geneva, Switzerland. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=9.32s)]
*  We were speaking in the U.N. Human Rights Council. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=13.42s)]
*  In part one of our conversation, we talked about Israel's war on Gaza. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=16.8s)]
*  Now we turn to part two. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=22.16s)]
*  We talked about immigration policy in the U.S., climate change and more. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  I started by asking the U.N. High Commissioner about the changing role of the U.S. in the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=27.8s)]
*  world. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=31.76s)]
*  So, Volker Turk, let's talk about the role of the United States, the most powerful country [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=32.76s)]
*  on earth. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=38.64s)]
*  In March, you expressed deep concern about a fundamental shift in direction in the United [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=39.92s)]
*  States under President Trump. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=45.8s)]
*  Can you elaborate? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=47.96s)]
*  Look, I have been very worried about what happens on the deportations and the treatment [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=48.96s)]
*  of migrants, for example. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=55.4s)]
*  And I've been worried about it because I see also the vilification of migrants and refugees [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=58.12s)]
*  in the public debate. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=62.92s)]
*  I was living, I lived in New York during COVID. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=65.08s)]
*  I was every day grateful for the migrant workers that kept the city going in terms of making [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=68.56s)]
*  sure that the garbage is collected, that we get our food. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=75.8s)]
*  I was actually at some stage wondering if they didn't work for us, if they didn't work, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=79.44s)]
*  what would happen to all of us? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=84.0s)]
*  We might actually starve. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=85.08s)]
*  And now I see the vilification of migrant workers. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=86.92s)]
*  I see a debate that reminds me of times that we thought we had all overcome. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=90.6s)]
*  And yes, that worries me because it polarizes and divides the society and it pits one group [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=96.36s)]
*  against the other. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=100.84s)]
*  And that's not what I know the United States to be. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=102.84s)]
*  The United States for me is a country that helped resettle refugees who were extremely [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=105.68s)]
*  vulnerable, who were persecuted. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=111.84s)]
*  I remember when in previous times the highest number of refugees that came from war-torn [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=114.28s)]
*  countries were accepted and hosted in the United States. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=120.0s)]
*  And I wish that this part of the United States comes out much more strongly in an environment [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=125.32s)]
*  that frankly is so divided. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=131.44s)]
*  So let's talk about SACOT for a minute. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=134.2s)]
*  In May, you expressed alarm over the Trump administration's use of a Salvadoran mega-prison [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=136.72s)]
*  to detain immigrants without due process, potentially for life. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=144.04s)]
*  Your office has received information from family members and lawyers regarding more [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=150.44s)]
*  than a hundred Venezuelans believed to be held at SACOT. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=154.6s)]
*  Can you talk about the men who have been shipped to this mega-prison? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=160.0s)]
*  So we were in touch with family members who didn't know where their loved ones were, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=166.45999999999998s)]
*  which for us of course always raises the alarm bells when it comes to are they missing, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=173.84s)]
*  are they disappeared, what happened to them? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  And it is an obligation of the state when you engage in deportations to inform, to provide [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=183.08s)]
*  information and frankly the fact that it went to a third country and not to the country [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=189.4s)]
*  of origin after due process because due process always has to be guaranteed is a huge worry [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=193.8s)]
*  and a huge concern. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=199.0s)]
*  We don't have, I wrote to the president of El Salvador about the conditions. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=201.36s)]
*  We don't have access there. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=208.0s)]
*  President Bukele, who called himself the coolest dictator in the world. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=210.0s)]
*  Well we wrote to him and we have engaged with the El Salvadorian authorities because of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  course there are human rights concerns that are attached to what's happening and we just, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  we have not been able to have access. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  Has he responded? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  No, he has not. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  Which happens sometimes but at the same time as you know including in the council that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=230.64s)]
*  you see behind you, the council is also for us the place where we can put issues and situations [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=237.6s)]
*  into the spotlight of international attention. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=246.16s)]
*  So for us it's also very important when we don't get the cooperation that we need to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=248.64s)]
*  actually mention it then in the public arena. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  And he hasn't let you into that prison? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=256.36s)]
*  We have not had access since that period. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=259.36s)]
*  Talking about immigration, what's happening to immigrants in the United States, you urged [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=264.68s)]
*  US authorities earlier this month to respect the right to peaceful assembly and refrain [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  from using military force in the context of the huge protests around Trump's policies. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=275.76s)]
*  Your reaction to Trump overriding California's governor deciding to send in the first national [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=283.12s)]
*  gaurd then the marines to crack down on the protests? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=289.34s)]
*  Well I made it absolutely clear before the council that any militarized response to the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=294.02s)]
*  freedom of peaceful assembly is absolutely not warranted when indeed you have peaceful [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=301.06s)]
*  assembly. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=307.41999999999996s)]
*  That's a fundamental freedom. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=308.41999999999996s)]
*  So I hope that it will come to a rethink of this type of approaches in the future because [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=310.76s)]
*  we know what it means when you militarize responses to essentially law enforcement issues. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=315.76s)]
*  But there is always the fundamental right of freedom of expression, of peaceful assembly, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=322.32s)]
*  of solidarity with people who are vulnerable. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=327.44s)]
*  And that needs to be respected. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=330.96s)]
*  You once quoted the 20th century philosopher Antonio Gramsci, imprisoned by the Italian [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=333.52s)]
*  fascist Mussolini for 12 years till his death. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=339.56s)]
*  You are making a comparison between fascism and Europe during early 20th century in the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=343.16s)]
*  surge of populism and nationalism and xenophobia today. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=351.24s)]
*  You quoted Gramsci saying, the old world is dying and the new world struggles to be born. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=355.18s)]
*  Now is the time of monsters. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=362.44000000000005s)]
*  Who are the monsters today? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=365.78000000000003s)]
*  The monsters today are the lack of solidarity and empathy and compassion that we see unfortunately [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=369.28s)]
*  reign not just in North America but also in Europe, in other parts of the world. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=378.55999999999995s)]
*  I mean I just came from Sri Lanka just to give you an example. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=384.23999999999995s)]
*  After 16 years of when the war ended in a brutal way, I still see the ghosts of the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=386.84s)]
*  past haunting the present. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=395.52s)]
*  It's as a result of fundamental divisions and polarizations and prejudice and racism [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=399.0s)]
*  that we saw what happened in the past. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=404.52s)]
*  I do think that the monsters of today is the absence of a public space where you can have [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=408.24s)]
*  a proper discussion, where you can agree to disagree but you actually have a debate about [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=414.28s)]
*  challenges. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=418.84s)]
*  What I see is people getting walked into their own bubbles, their echo chambers, not listening [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=420.56s)]
*  to the other anymore and not understanding the grievances that exist and trying to find [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=428.12s)]
*  a solution to it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=433.44s)]
*  So for me it's actually politics that has become quite tone deaf to the real concerns [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=434.44s)]
*  that people have and that worries me a lot because the absence of a public space means [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=440.88s)]
*  the absence of compromise, the absence of finding a solution, the absence of debating [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=446.32s)]
*  and disagreeing or agreeing and fighting it out but in a constructive way that actually [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=453.03999999999996s)]
*  leads to solutions. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=458.76s)]
*  There's just a piece in the Washington Post about the cutting of USAID funding in the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=461.79999999999995s)]
*  world and it said, children clung to life in Sudan by the slenderest of threads supported [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=468.56s)]
*  by community soup kitchens. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=475.55999999999995s)]
*  When the USAID funding cuts came and their mothers watched them starve to death one by [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=478.6s)]
*  one, can you talk about the effects of this drastic cut, the ending essentially of USAID [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=486.6s)]
*  in the world, programs that have been established for years and also the cuts to the United [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=495.84000000000003s)]
*  Nations and the effects that that has had, those cuts by the United States, by President [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=501.96000000000004s)]
*  Trump? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=507.32000000000005s)]
*  So it is extremely, extremely unfortunate that USAID is no longer there in the way that [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=508.36s)]
*  we know it because USAID provided immediate relief to millions of people. It made sure [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=516.6s)]
*  that human rights NGOs at the grassroots level for example, I've met many of them, are running [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=524.32s)]
*  out of funding and may no longer be able to be the fighters for freedom and justice. It [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=531.6s)]
*  means that as you just mentioned in many conflict situations around the world we simply will [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=539.08s)]
*  not be able to provide the humanitarian assistance that is required and that means again real [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=544.2800000000001s)]
*  life consequences. People will die, people will end up in extremely vulnerable situations [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=550.6800000000001s)]
*  and it will lead to more, potentially more conflict. I mean what the US generously has [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=557.36s)]
*  done for decades has been its soft power. It has also influenced things in a positive [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=563.6800000000001s)]
*  way. Now that's gone and yes I'm worried about it. The same with the United Nations. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=568.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean the fact that some of the massive funding, my own organization, we are not going, our [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=575.9200000000001s)]
*  funding was cut which means that we will not be able to continue doing the monitoring [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=581.76s)]
*  and the reporting and the documenting and the intervening and being the bridge between [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=587.04s)]
*  civil society and the institutions of the state. For example in Colombia we have to [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=591.28s)]
*  cut our operation by half and that has, again we are an important part of the peace process. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=595.48s)]
*  It means that this will suffer and yes these are the real life consequences of such decisions [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=601.3199999999999s)]
*  which I regret very much. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=607.28s)]
*  I just watched you give an opening address here at the UN Human Rights Council. You were [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=608.8399999999999s)]
*  talking about climate change. We at Democracy Now! have attended the UN climate summits [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=613.9599999999999s)]
*  from Copenhagen in 2009 on to what will be on the edge of the rainforest, the Brazil [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=619.04s)]
*  UN human, the UN climate summit. We also just came here from New York. We were experiencing [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=626.04s)]
*  a major heat dome in New York, came to Geneva. You're experiencing here the same thing, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=633.04s)]
*  extreme weather raging across the globe. The Financial Times reporting Sunday quote, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=640.56s)]
*  temperatures reached dangerous highs as heat domes hit Europe and the US. Volker Turk you've [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=647.0799999999999s)]
*  called for states, corporations to be held to account including for damages to the climate [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=654.16s)]
*  and environment. Can you relate the climate catastrophe that we are experiencing to immigration [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=661.16s)]
*  to the crises that we're experiencing around the world with that to poverty to indigenous [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=669.16s)]
*  rights and who is responsible? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=675.16s)]
*  So the climate crisis is absolutely a human rights crisis. There's no doubt about it [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=678.16s)]
*  and one of the big collateral damages of the wars that we see to come from the United States [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=682.16s)]
*  and the challenges of the wars that we see today is actually that there is less focus [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=689.16s)]
*  on the big challenges of our time such as climate change. I mean a couple of years ago [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=694.16s)]
*  I remember when I came to New York in 2019 there were young people on the streets. Everyone [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=697.88s)]
*  was protesting and you know activating Fridays for Future. There were all these movements [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=704.26s)]
*  about making sure that climate change and climate action is addressed properly. Today [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=711.28s)]
*  you don't see it in the same way and despite the fact that we already live the consequences. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=717.2s)]
*  I mean the heat dome over the Europe, I mean we decided not to wear ties anymore as a result [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=722.2800000000001s)]
*  but it shows when it also affects us what does it mean for indigenous peoples? What [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=728.2800000000001s)]
*  does it mean for the most vulnerable? What does it mean for a woman who has six children [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=733.2s)]
*  in the Sahel how she's going to survive? And yes people will probably have to leave behind [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=737.76s)]
*  their livelihoods and what will happen you will see massive internal migration in the [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=745.76s)]
*  countries in the climate hotspots around the world. I don't think we should ever go into [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=751.96s)]
*  this that they will all come to Europe or the United States. They won't. They will try [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=759.08s)]
*  to survive in their own countries but under abominable circumstances. So yes the climate [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=763.4s)]
*  emergency is one of the big big challenges of our time and I hope that politicians refocus [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=769.52s)]
*  on it and spend their political capital and their political energy on trying to resolve [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=776.68s)]
*  it and we have the solutions to it. Your response to President Trump basically his mantra is [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=781.84s)]
*  drill may be drill? Well renew energy, renew energy, renew energy and let's get into a [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=787.0799999999999s)]
*  much better world. I mean we know that the fossil fuel is not going to be the future. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=794.2s)]
*  That's long the past and even behind the past so we absolutely need a rethink of all of [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=801.2s)]
*  these things. Just outside the UN Human Rights Council right outside the main door in the [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=807.08s)]
*  hallway the council has agreed to the Sahrawi women building a haima, a tent that is so [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=815.5600000000001s)]
*  familiar to the indigenous people of Western Sahara. They have fought for decades to organize [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=824.08s)]
*  a UN backed referendum on independence. Volker Turk I saw you a few years ago. You reiterated [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=832.08s)]
*  the right to self determination when addressing the Sahrawi issue calling for placing human [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=840.4200000000001s)]
*  rights at the heart of the issue. What's been the Security Council, the UN General [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=846.64s)]
*  Assembly's decisions regarding the issue of Western Sahara? Basically we have decisions [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=853.48s)]
*  taken by the Security Council that have not been implemented. That's the fact of the matter. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=860.48s)]
*  Occupied by Morocco since 1975. Exactly so we have and that's again one of those long [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=866.48s)]
*  protracted situations where we haven't seen a resolution. On the human rights front I've [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=874.8000000000001s)]
*  asked to send a mission there but unfortunately I have not been successful. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsJ5Aiq01I&t=880.44s)]
