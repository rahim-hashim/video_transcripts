*  In Gaza, Israeli air attacks in the north of the Gaza Strip have killed at least 18
*  Palestinians in Jabalia and Beit Lachia.

*  Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and three leaders of Hamas.
*  President Biden condemned the move by the ICC Monday as he spoke at a White House event
*  for Jewish American Heritage Month.
*  Let me be clear.
*  We reject the ICC's application of arrest warrants against Israeli leaders.
*  Whatever these warrants may imply, there is no equivalence between Israel and Hamas.
*  And it's clear Israel wants to do all it can to ensure civilian protection.
*  Republicans say they're considering sanctions against the International Criminal Court.
*  Meanwhile, independent Senator Bernie Sanders backed the actions by the ICC, saying, quote,

*  against impunity in all situations, unquote.
*  Palestinian officials have welcomed the possible arrest warrants while condemning the double
*  standards against Palestinians resisting Israeli occupation.
*  Displaced Palestinians in Raqqa weighed in on the decision.
*  My opinion about the ICC decision is that they've equated the victim with the executioner.
*  They made victim and executioner equal.
*  The criminal, Netanyahu and Gantz, who have killed the people of Palestine for more than
*  75 years, equal to the Palestinians who have resisted and demanded their rights.
*  The homeland is our right, and we must demand our right.

*  In Iran, funeral ceremonies have begun for Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi, who was killed
*  in a helicopter crash Sunday, along with the Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdullahiyeh
*  and several other Iranian officials and crew.

*  Back in New York, prosecutors rested their case Monday in Donald Trump's criminal hush
*  money in 2016 election interference trial.
*  Trump's lawyers called witness Robert Costello.
*  He's an attorney who's accused Michael Cohen of lying, but his testimony soon devolved
*  after he complained about prosecutors' objections, as well as the judge, leading Judge Juan Marchand
*  to reprimand him and briefly clear the courtroom.
*  At one point, Judge Marchand asked Costello, quote, are you staring me down right now?

*  historical events.
*  Larry Bensky also hosted KPFA's public affairs show Sunday Salon and later the classical
*  music show Piano.
*  He also wrote for various publications, including The Nation, and was a professor.
*  In this KPFA clip, Bensky reflects on why he chose the career of journalism.
*  I thought that bringing people information about things would stir things up.
*  It's not that bringing people the information automatically brings a cure to humanity's
*  ills and we wouldn't have somebody else.
*  It's that if you don't do it, it's certainly not going to change.
*  So that's how I became what I think of as an activist journalist.
*  Larry Bensky was also one of the original co-hosts of Democracy Now! in 1996.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
