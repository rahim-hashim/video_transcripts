We speak with the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa after she got extraordinary access to an ICE detention center in Colorado, where she interviewed the immigrant rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra. The undocumented mother of four was arrested by federal agents in Denver in March after she successfully fought multiple deportation efforts since 2009, including when she took sanctuary in a Denver church with her children in 2017. She received a stay of removal but returned to sanctuary in 2019 when it expired, then received additional stays under the Biden administration that also expired. She now finds herself in the sights of the Trump administration as it seeks to fulfill its goal of mass deportations of immigrants. "I am a political prisoner," Vizguerra told Hinojosa. She "believes that she is not being held in immigrant detention because of her immigration status, but rather she is being held because of her words and because of her activism," says Hinojosa.

*  Then, in 2017, during the first Trump administration, she was targeted for deportation and took [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  sanctuary in the Unitarian Church in Denver, living there with three of her young children. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=55.56s)]
*  She received a stay of removal, but then, upon its expiration in 2019, returned to sanctuary. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=63.0s)]
*  She received additional deportation stays during the Biden administration, but those [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=69.2s)]
*  eventually expired. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  Her lawyers allege that Jeanette was detained in March in retaliation for speech that's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=75.22s)]
*  protected under the First Amendment. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=80.68s)]
*  Jeanette Vizgarra is a longtime activist who worked as an SEIU labor organizer, volunteered [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=83.2s)]
*  with the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition and the American Friends Service Committee, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=88.04s)]

*  Ice Denver and Sanctuary for All. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=98.92s)]
*  In 2017, during the first Trump administration, I visited Jeanette Vizgarra at the First Unitarian [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=102.0s)]
*  Society Church in Denver, where she sought sanctuary and talked to her. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=108.94s)]
*  Are you prepared for ICE to come in at any time? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=115.08s)]
*  Yes, we have an internal plan here at the church, and not only at this church, also [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=118.78s)]
*  at the church where Ingrid is, who is at the other church in Mountain View. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=128.62s)]
*  She has been in sanctuary for over three months. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=133.7s)]
*  Both churches are part of the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition, and each church has its [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=136.9s)]
*  own emergency plan. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=142.62s)]
*  I am also prepared. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  Before coming here, I prepared a family plan in case ICE were to go to my house. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=146.62s)]
*  Part of the plan with my children was that one of them would be filming and the other [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=152.32s)]
*  one would be calling people from a list that I gave them. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=156.94s)]
*  And here, we have a similar plan. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=160.88s)]
*  So I am prepared and so are the people here. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=163.38s)]
*  We hope that Donald Trump will respect these spaces. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=166.5s)]
*  It would look wrong, from a moral standpoint, if he came after mothers who are just fighting [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=170.58s)]
*  for their families. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=175.62s)]
*  That was Jeanette Vizgarra eight years ago, in 2017. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=183.38s)]
*  Earlier this month, she was named one of this year's recipients of the Robert F. Kennedy [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=190.3s)]
*  Human Rights Award. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=195.2s)]
*  It marks the first time the award has been given to someone in immigration detention. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=196.92s)]
*  Jeanette Vizgarra recently spoke to the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Latino USA host [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  Mariana Hossa, in a rare interview on camera from inside the ICE jail. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  In a moment, we're going to play Jeanette Vizgarra in her own words. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=214.67999999999998s)]
*  But first, we turn to Mariana Hossa, who's joining us from Austin, Texas. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=219.0s)]
*  Mariah, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=224.2s)]
*  How did you get this interview? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=227.16s)]
*  How often do you get to go into an ICE jail? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=229.64s)]
*  Good morning, Amy. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=233.72s)]
*  Good morning, Juan, from Austin. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=236.11999999999998s)]
*  Look, when we got the news that we were going to be able to come inside the Aurora ICE [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  processing center with a camera and a microphone, I couldn't believe it, because I essentially [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=245.0s)]
*  have been banned from going inside immigrant detention facilities, because I'm one of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=252.12s)]
*  the few who has been documenting this since about 2010 and showing what these places actually [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=258.08s)]
*  look like and what the treatment is like for people being held. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=264.76s)]
*  So when I heard that I was going to be allowed inside, of course, I immediately asked my [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  producer what happened. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=272.68s)]
*  It goes to the heart of Jeanette Vizgarra's case. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=274.16s)]
*  Jeanette Vizgarra believes that she is not being held in immigrant detention because [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=277.52s)]
*  of her immigration status, but rather she is being held because of her words and because [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  of her activism. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=290.34s)]
*  And so, what we understand is that when we made the request to come and interview her [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=292.26s)]
*  and we were expecting a denial, her lawyer said, if you deny Maria Hinojosa and Latino [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=297.68s)]
*  to come in and interview Jeanette Vizgarra, we can make this part of our case, arguing [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=305.64s)]
*  on her First Amendment rights. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=310.84s)]
*  It was an absolute checkmate situation, where they had to essentially let us in with cameras, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=313.12s)]
*  with microphones, to see Jeanette Vizgarra in the Aurora detention facility and see [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=319.76s)]
*  Amy and Juan. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=326.08s)]
*  You know, I've been visiting detention facilities for years, right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=327.68s)]
*  And I've been in maximum-security men's prisons for years. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=333.56s)]
*  I had to walk through‚ÄîAmy and Juan‚ÄîI had to walk through nine prison doors in order [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=337.84s)]
*  to get to where Jeanette was being seated inside a windowless room where we were going [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  to do the interview. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=350.0s)]
*  When I go into a maximum-security men's prison, there are two doors, two prison doors, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=351.68s)]
*  And yet, in an ICE detention facility run by privately held GEO Group, where majority [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=357.2s)]
*  of the people being held there are not criminals, they are treated worse than in a maximum-security [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=364.6s)]
*  men's prison. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=371.52s)]
*  It was shocking, but I will say that Jeanette Vizgarra, though she is sick‚Äîshe told us [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=372.56s)]
*  she has a stomach virus, she says many people are sick inside the detention facility‚Äîshe [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=377.8s)]
*  appeared firm in our interview. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=383.64s)]
*  It lasted one hour. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=385.44s)]
*  And, Maria, how would you compare Jeanette's case to that of someone like Mahmoud Khalil, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=386.44s)]
*  who was detained over his Palestinian rights activism, both clearly being targeted because [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=393.36s)]
*  of their speech? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=400.76s)]
*  Jeanette Vizgarra says that she is the Mahmoud Khalil of the immigrant rights and sanctuary [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=403.76s)]
*  rights movement. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=409.56s)]
*  She believes that, just like Mahmoud Khalil, from Columbia University, where I'm a professor [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=411.12s)]
*  at Barnard College, she believes that he is being held and targeted because of his activism. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=416.28s)]
*  She says, the same thing is happening to me. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=422.35999999999996s)]
*  I'm being held and targeted because of my activism. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=424.8s)]
*  By the way, somebody senior in the comms department from the Department of Homeland Security said [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=428.44s)]
*  after Jeanette had been taken, said actually in a tweet, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=435.96s)]
*  So, she absolutely feels like she is being targeted. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=439.56s)]
*  The ICE agent, one of the ICE agents who took her when she was apprehended in Colorado, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=451.79999999999995s)]
*  said to her, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=458.24s)]
*  So, Jeanette argues, her lawyers argue, that she has absolutely been targeted by this administration. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=465.44s)]
*  Maria, we're going to hear Jeanette describe this situation in her own words, in her conversation [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=471.32s)]
*  with you. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=478.12s)]
*  We're talking to Mariana Josa, the host of Latino USA. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=479.12s)]
*  Let's go to an extended excerpt of that conversation that Jeanette Vizgarra had with [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=482.76s)]
*  inside the privately run immigration jail in Aurora, Colorado. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=490.2s)]
*  Did you imagine that you would end up being the very specific target of a new Trump administration? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=496.52000000000004s)]
*  I knew that if, well, in fact, many people, colleagues and friends warned me, Jeanette, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=506.8s)]
*  you're going to need to stay quiet, have a plan for yourself, don't make noise because [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=513.52s)]
*  they're going to come after you. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=518.24s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=520.84s)]
*  Trump won. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=521.84s)]
*  And the first time when he signed the executive action removing sensitive locations, which [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=522.84s)]
*  of course I had helped create with the Sanctuary Foundation, the Sanctuary Coalition, and I [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=527.5600000000001s)]
*  was a national sanctuary leader, the media started reaching out to me. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=533.16s)]
*  And I was like, should I do it or not? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=539.88s)]
*  Thinking about it, right? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=542.36s)]
*  But at the same time, I set my whole family down. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=544.08s)]
*  And I told them, we have to have a plan because things are going to happen. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=547.4s)]
*  And so when when in your head, when you were asking yourself, do I speak out or do I not [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=552.76s)]
*  speak out after Trump had been reelected? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=560.9s)]
*  I wondered about that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=565.28s)]
*  But then the first raid happened. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=567.0s)]
*  I already had this feeling that something was in the air, something was going on. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=568.6800000000001s)]
*  Was it a feeling of fear? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=573.64s)]
*  I always have that kind of intuition that something is going to happen, that something [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=576.16s)]
*  is coming. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=582.08s)]
*  I spoke with my colleagues and I told them about the plan just in case. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  The day before, because I went to a march that Sunday, right before I was arrested, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=588.48s)]
*  I made a call to the community. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=594.76s)]
*  In fact, I was able to give one last interview where I said we are living in difficult times [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=599.56s)]
*  and that we also needed to have an escalation protocol, a way to better protect our community. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=606.5799999999999s)]
*  How many days after you made that speech on that Sunday saying they are escalating, we [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=613.28s)]
*  have to escalate too as activists? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=621.64s)]
*  How many days after that were you detained? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=624.56s)]
*  Do you believe, Jeanette, that you specifically are being targeted because of your activism, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=629.4s)]
*  because you speak out? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=637.9200000000001s)]
*  Yes, and I found out that same day I was detained because, well, the officer placed his phone [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=641.9200000000001s)]
*  down like this and when he did, the screen lit up. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=648.9200000000001s)]
*  And there it was, my social media and the photo of my husband. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=653.0s)]
*  I said to him, why are you monitoring my social media? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=659.04s)]
*  He said, it's public. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=662.76s)]
*  And another one responded, we finally got you. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=664.76s)]
*  So what do you think the Trump administration? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=668.08s)]
*  They are trying to say that they have the power, that they have the resources, and that [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=675.24s)]
*  they will deport anyone, not just me, but anyone who is inconvenient. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=680.16s)]
*  They want to send a message to other activists like me that they will suffer the same consequences. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=685.1600000000001s)]
*  They want to silence us. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=690.44s)]
*  They want to erase us from the map. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=695.44s)]
*  But I've said it before and I will say it again. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=697.44s)]
*  It doesn't matter where I am, whether I'm here or in my country, because I will have [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=699.44s)]
*  influence on a bi-national level. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=705.0400000000001s)]
*  It doesn't matter if I'm not physically here. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=707.0400000000001s)]
*  I have my seeds here. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=710.2s)]
*  Do you believe that you are here because of political persecution? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=712.4399999999999s)]
*  I am a political prisoner. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=720.4399999999999s)]
*  I never thought I would become a political prisoner in the United States, a country where [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=721.4399999999999s)]
*  laws are supposedly respected, where freedom of speech is protected, where one was supposedly [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=726.4399999999999s)]
*  has the right to speak out, to protest, to denounce injustice. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=732.0s)]
*  That is what I am, a political prisoner. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=736.52s)]
*  And not just me. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=739.0s)]
*  There are others, too, because of their activism who are imprisoned right now. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=740.12s)]
*  Do you believe that you are the Mahmoud Khalil of the immigrant rights movement? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=744.12s)]
*  We are in the same situation. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=751.12s)]
*  We are in the same situation. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=754.12s)]
*  And there are many of us. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=756.12s)]
*  When you say the words, I am a political prisoner, tell me what's going on for you as you say [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=758.12s)]
*  those words about yourself right now in the year 2025. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=765.12s)]
*  In 2025, we are going back so many years. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=770.12s)]
*  Like I say, we're heading toward a dictatorship because they want to silence those of us who [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=777.12s)]
*  are raising our voices, those of us who are revolutionizing movements. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=783.12s)]
*  You say that you are here because you're fighting for your First Amendment right. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=789.12s)]
*  You say that you won't be quiet no matter where you are, what country or what place [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=795.24s)]
*  that you're being detained. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=800.24s)]
*  So in fact, what is your message to the world right now? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=802.24s)]
*  My message to everyone who might watch this interview is that no leader who's making [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=809.24s)]
*  change will have a life free of suffering. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=815.24s)]
*  All leaders suffer. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=818.24s)]
*  All leaders face attempts to be silenced. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=820.24s)]
*  All leaders face efforts to make us disappear. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=823.36s)]
*  But thanks to everything we do, we achieve enormous change out there. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=828.36s)]
*  And right now, the message to the community is, the people save the people. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=833.36s)]
*  If you remain silent, we will not have change. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=838.36s)]
*  That's Jeanette Vizgarra speaking to Latino USA host Maria Nojosa. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=842.36s)]
*  They are inside an ICE jail in Aurora, Colorado, run by GeoGroup. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=847.48s)]
*  Maria Nojosa is still with us, speaking to us from Austin, Texas. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=853.48s)]
*  Maria, she talks about all leaders suffer. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=858.48s)]
*  In fact, in the rest of the interview‚Äîand we'll link to it at democracynow.org that [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=861.48s)]
*  you've posted on YouTube on video, and we'll link to your Latino USA piece for radio‚Äîin [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=866.48s)]
*  the rest of it, she breaks down. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=873.48s)]
*  Jeanette breaks down as she talks about her four children, her seeds. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=876.6s)]
*  Can you talk about her strength and what she faces? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=882.6s)]
*  You know, Amy, it was really something to witness, being inside the detention center. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=888.6s)]
*  I actually call them detention camps. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=895.6s)]
*  Center is just too neutral of a word. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=897.72s)]
*  And to realize that even inside the detention facility, Jeanette continues to be an organizer. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=902.72s)]
*  So people are coming to her, and they're asking her, what should I do if I'm sick? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=909.72s)]
*  How, you know, can I get in touch with this person, make a call? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=913.72s)]
*  She told me that the phones oftentimes are simply not working, which is extraordinary [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=916.72s)]
*  for people being held and not having access to phones. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=922.84s)]
*  So inside the detention camp, she is still helping people. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=927.84s)]
*  And Jeanette is a consummate organizer and an activist. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=932.84s)]
*  And journalists like us who do these interviews, we understand the amount of work it takes [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=936.84s)]
*  to be an activist and an organizer. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=943.84s)]
*  It's not simple. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=945.84s)]
*  And so oftentimes in the interview, when I would ask Jeanette about her personal feelings, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=947.96s)]
*  she would start talking about other people who were in a difficult situation, other people [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=953.96s)]
*  who she's helped. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=957.96s)]
*  And Amy and Juan, I had to kind of ask her more than once to talk about herself. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=959.96s)]
*  How does she feel being held away from her four children, three of whom were born in [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=966.96s)]
*  the United States? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=971.96s)]
*  How does she feel emotionally? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=973.96s)]
*  And at the end of the interview, Amy, Jeanette did something which she rarely does. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=977.08s)]
*  She does not like to show this part of herself. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=981.08s)]
*  But she cried. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=984.08s)]
*  And she told me that it is incredibly lonely to be inside and to have all of this pressure [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=986.08s)]
*  and to know that the whole world is watching her. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=993.08s)]
*  But it was‚Äîwe were able to see a moment of vulnerability, because al final de cuentas, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=998.08s)]
*  Jeanette Vizguerra is a mom who is an activist and who lives in Colorado for 30 years. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1003.2s)]
*  So she's a human being. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1012.2s)]
*  And that was part of our intention, was to hear from Jeanette and see her not just as [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1014.2s)]
*  a political prisoner, but as a mom and as a human being. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1020.2s)]
*  And, Maria, I wanted to ask you about the broader issue of the last few months as immigration [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1024.2s)]
*  raids have been going on, especially agents of ICE picking people up outside of courthouses [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1031.32s)]
*  and in various cities, and the advertising campaign that Homeland Security has been mounting [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1041.1200000000001s)]
*  urging undocumented immigrants to self-deport. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1049.76s)]
*  You know, Juan, I look at my Instagram feed and I see a lot of people who are saying, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1052.76s)]
*  and first thing in the morning, of course, and what do you see? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1061.3600000000001s)]
*  You see stories about a baby, a four-year-old, who could be dead in a matter of days if she's [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1065.56s)]
*  removed from this country. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1072.56s)]
*  You see the story of a high schooler, I believe his name is Dylan, who went in, was following [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1074.24s)]
*  the law and the process legally, and then is taken right outside of a courthouse in [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1080.24s)]
*  New York City. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1086.0800000000002s)]
*  You see the stories of men who are climbing, undocumented immigrants who are climbing trees [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1087.8999999999999s)]
*  in order to escape ICE, who are fully in, like, you know, in almost military garb covering [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1094.8999999999999s)]
*  their faces. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1101.34s)]
*  What are we supposed to call this when you have masked agents with no identification [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1102.9399999999998s)]
*  taking people off streets and farms and corners and courthouses? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1110.26s)]
*  You know, the question is, for those people who voted for Donald Trump, are you satisfied? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1116.18s)]
*  Does this make you feel like we are a better country because you're seeing this? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1121.6200000000001s)]
*  This is not sustainable. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1127.38s)]
*  And what Jeanette told me, and kind of the new movement in terms of the sanctuary movement, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1129.5400000000002s)]
*  which I've been covering since the 1980s, the new movement, the sanctuary movement, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1136.7800000000002s)]
*  is not behind closed doors in a church. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1142.58s)]
*  The new movement, the sanctuary movement, is people of conscience with American citizenship [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1145.66s)]
*  who can go and take the sanctuary movement to the streets. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1152.94s)]
*  And this is where our country is going, Juan. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1157.0s)]
*  It is a very desperate place, but then you see people like Jeanette Vizguerra, who, she's [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1159.3s)]
*  holding her head high, even though she is in a very, very challenging situation in this [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1165.42s)]
*  ICE detention camp. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1169.9s)]
*  And I wanted to ask you about, well, related news, reports emerging of Trump's so-called [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1171.44s)]
*  border czar, Tom Homan, earning at least $5,000 in fees for his consulting work for [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1177.24s)]
*  the private prison company GeoGroup, which operates at least 16 jails or detention centers [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1183.92s)]
*  nationwide, a key contractor in carrying out Trump's mass deportations. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1189.8400000000001s)]
*  Homan has been at the head of Trump's raids, mass detention, deportation agenda, and was [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1194.92s)]
*  acting director of ICE in the first Trump administration. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1199.98s)]
*  And yes, Jeanette Vizguerra is being held in a GeoGroup jail. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1203.3000000000002s)]
*  Mariel. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1208.3000000000002s)]
*  And Tom Homan also served under Barack Obama. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1209.3000000000002s)]
*  So Tom Homan has been around for a long time. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1215.18s)]
*  You know, I think that people who watch and listen to Democracy Now are clear about the [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1219.66s)]
*  fact that you have privately run prison. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1224.5400000000002s)]
*  So you have a private prison industry that runs prisons and now actually is making their [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1227.3s)]
*  money millions upon millions of dollars by keeping people in a detention bed. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1234.8999999999999s)]
*  That is how they make their profit. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1242.98s)]
*  And if mass incarceration, because of activists, has decreased a little bit, mass detention [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1245.72s)]
*  is on the rise. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1253.3s)]
*  The money that is going to be made by Geo, by CoreCivic, which used to be known as Corrections [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1254.84s)]
*  Corporation of America, they don't want people to know that they are in the business [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1260.6s)]
*  of detention, so they just got rid of that name and call themselves CoreCivic. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1266.0s)]
*  The American people need to understand that profit is being made by keeping a person in [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1270.3999999999999s)]
*  a detention bed. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1276.12s)]
*  And how do they feel about this? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1278.24s)]
*  Again, not just Tom Homan, but thousands of people are making money, making big bucks [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1280.24s)]
*  off of this. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1288.48s)]
*  And this is totally distressing. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1289.48s)]
*  I'll just tell you‚ÄîI'll give you one scene from the detention facility in Aurora. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1292.1599999999999s)]
*  You walk into the entrance room, the kind of lobby area. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1296.6799999999998s)]
*  Now, Geo is a billion-dollar company. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1303.32s)]
*  You should have seen the pictures that they had on the wall in the little lobby area, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1308.32s)]
*  trying to show that they are a great facility. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1313.0s)]
*  You would expect from a multimillion-dollar corporation that they would have the best [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1316.36s)]
*  photographs about the best treatment that they're offering. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1321.3999999999999s)]
*  It was disgusting. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1325.16s)]
*  They had a photograph of a wall of phones and said, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1326.92s)]
*  "'Expert communications available.'" [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1330.44s)]
*  They had a picture of half of a basketball court with all walls and just a skylight, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1333.6399999999999s)]
*  this big. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1341.9199999999998s)]
*  And they were like, facilities for, you know, gymnastics and working out. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1342.9199999999998s)]
*  It was horrific, Amy. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1348.1599999999999s)]
*  And so, this is what most people cannot get a chance to see, because they're privately [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1350.8799999999999s)]
*  run. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1356.0s)]
*  And they can just say, we're not going to let any reporters in, ever. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1357.0s)]
*  And they can do that. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNz8NqvZzaw&t=1361.08s)]
