**Democracy Now Headlines:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr12woJ2P3o)

*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel's military has ordered hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to evacuate their
*  homes or face death as it launches a fresh-ground offensive in the northern Gaza Strip.
*  The latest mass evacuation order came on the first anniversary of the start of Israel's
*  brutal assault on Gaza following Hamas' surprise attack on October 7.
*  Over the weekend, at least 26 Palestinians were killed after Israeli forces attacked
*  a mosque and a school sheltering displaced people and Daryl Ballah.
*  Elsewhere, at least nine children were among 17 killed when Israel's military bombed
*  the Jubalya refugee camp.
*  Many residents were unable or unwilling to leave their homes.
*  I am staying here.
*  Where else would I go?
*  I want to die here.
*  As long as they say that evacuation is forbidden, where will I go?
*  We are staying.
*  If they want us to die, so be it.
*  And I suffer from osteoarthritis.
*  Where do I go?
*  Israeli artillery shell struck the home of 19-year-old journalist Hassan Hamad in Jubalya,
*  killing him.
*  In recent weeks, Hamad had received death threats via WhatsApp from an Israeli number.
*  He also received phone calls and text messages from an Israeli officer ordering him to stop
*  filming.
*  Hassan Hamad is at least the 175th Palestinian journalist killed in Gaza since last October.
*  He's among at least 41,900 Palestinians killed over the past year in Gaza.
*  Another 97,000 have been injured, according to Gaza's health ministry, though those
*  figures are certain to be a vast undercount.
*  Dozens of massive explosions rocked the Lebanese capital overnight, Sunday marking Israel's
*  heaviest bombardment on Beirut and the city's southern suburbs since Israel widened its
*  war on Lebanon two weeks ago.
*  Earlier today, Israeli warplanes bombed a fire station in the town of Barakit, killing
*  at least eight people.
*  On Sunday, Hezbollah fired rockets at the Israeli port city of Haifa, wounding at least
*  ten people.
*  Israel's assault has now displaced 1.2 million people in Lebanon, after headlines will go
*  to Beirut for the latest.
*  In Israel, the loved ones of hostages took to the streets over the weekend, blocking
*  traffic in Tel Aviv, holding protests marking the one-year anniversary of the October 7th
*  Hamas attack.
*  Over 1,100 people were killed in Israel in the Hamas-led attacks a year ago, while at
*  least 250 were taken hostage.
*  Around 100 of the hostages remain in Gaza, though only 70 of them are still believed
*  to be alive.
*  105 hostages were released by Hamas during a temporary ceasefire in November.
*  This is Ya'el Or, whose cousin, Dror, was killed one year ago but whose body remains
*  held in Gaza.
*  Why are they still in Gaza a full year later?
*  Because of Netanyahu.
*  Netanyahu wants to stay in power forever, and to do that, he has dragged Israel into
*  eternal, never-ending war.
*  This means that our hostages have been abandoned in Hamas' death tunnels deep under Gaza.
*  Netanyahu has committed crime against his own people.
*  Later in the broadcast, we'll speak with Israeli peace activist Maoz Inan, who lost
*  both his parents in the October 7th attack.
*  We'll also speak with Aziz Abusara, a Palestinian peace activist.
*  Maoz and Aziz have traveled the world, met with the Pope and U.S. Congress members, calling
*  for an end to the occupation, an end to war, and calling for a permanent ceasefire.
*  French President Emmanuel Macron says France is no longer sending arms to Israel and called
*  on other nations to halt deliveries of weapons.
*  However, we also try to be consistent.
*  And when we call for ceasefires—this is the case for Gaza, this was also the case
*  for Lebanon last week—well, we try not to call for a ceasefire while continuing to deliver
*  weapons of war.
*  And I think it's just consistency.
*  Meanwhile, in an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes, Vice President Kamala Harris defended
*  U.S. military aid to Israel, which soared to a record $17.9 billion over the past year.
*  A senior Pentagon official warned the White House last October that Israel's plan to
*  uproot more than a million Palestinians from their homes in Gaza would be a humanitarian
*  disaster and could violate international law leading to war crime charges against Israel.
*  That's according to Reuters, which reports the warning came in an October 13th email
*  to the White House from Dana Struhl, then the deputy assistant secretary of defense
*  for the Middle East.
*  Struhl wrote that an assessment by the Red Cross predicting a humanitarian catastrophe
*  from Israel's mass expulsion order had left her chilled to the bone.
*  Despite those concerns and similar dire warnings from the State Department's Bureau of Democracy,
*  Labor and Human Rights, the White House expedited the transfer of weapons to Israel, including
*  thousands of precision-guided missiles and 2,000-pound bombs.
*  Meanwhile, DropSite News is reporting,
*  came after he joined an emergency meeting of Israel's war cabinet at the Israeli military
*  headquarters in Tel Aviv last October 16th and 17th.
*  After the talks, cabinet member Bezalel Smotryk said, quote,
*  We in the cabinet were promised at the outset that aid trucks hijacked by Hamas and its
*  organizations would be bombed from the air and the aid would be halted, he said.
*  Hundreds of thousands of protesters marched in cities across the world Saturday to demand
*  an end to Israel's brutal assault on Gaza and its widening war on Lebanon.
*  Huge crowds flooded the streets of London, Berlin, Paris, Istanbul, Melbourne, Australia,
*  Cape Town, South Africa and Karachi, Pakistan, in solidarity with Palestinians.
*  Here in the United States, protesters rallied in downtown Washington, D.C., near the White
*  House.
*  This is Anisa Daoudi of the Palestinian Youth Movement.
*  Our role here in the United States and specifically here in Washington, D.C., is to uplift the
*  demand for an arms embargo on Israel and is to demand that our politicians, the Biden
*  administration and the next administration, whoever that may be, to end all U.S. aid and
*  end its complicity in this genocide.
*  We know that without the financial backing and the diplomatic cover that the U.S. is
*  providing on Israel, we know that this genocide would not have been possible.
*  At Saturday's rally near the White House, photojournalist Samuel Mina Jr. of Arizona
*  was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries after he lit his left arm on fire
*  in an act of protest.
*  Ahead of his self-immolation, Mina spoke of his guilt over participating in biased media
*  coverage of Gaza, writing, quote,
*  "'How many Palestinians were killed that I allowed to be branded as Hamas?
*  How many men, women and children were struck with a missile co-signed by the American media?'
*  The graduate of the Cronkite School of Journalism in Arizona asked.
*  The Dominican Republic says it will immediately begin expelling up to 10,000 undocumented
*  Haitian residents a week despite warnings from the U.N. and rights groups about the
*  worsening security and humanitarian situation in Haiti.
*  The Dominican president Luis Abinader has made cracking down on Haitian communities
*  and on his country's border with Haiti a central pillar of his presidency.
*  The U.N. reported last month at least 3,660 people were killed in Haiti in the first half
*  of this year due to gang violence.
*  Just last week, a gang attack in central Haiti killed at least 70 people and displaced some
*  6,300 Haitians.
*  In Mexico, the new mayor of Chilpancingo, capital of Guerrero State, was murdered Sunday,
*  just days after taking office.
*  Alejandro Arco's death came three days after the city's new secretary, Francisco Tapia,
*  was shot dead.
*  At least six candidates for public office in Mexico were killed in the lead-up to this
*  year's June elections.
*  Mexico's new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, who was inaugurated a week ago, has vowed
*  to take on the homicide crisis and organized crime.
*  In the United States, residents of Florida are once again evacuating their homes as Hurricane
*  Milton barrels towards Florida's Gulf Coast, threatening major storm surges and widespread
*  destruction around Tampa Bay and other areas.
*  Milton is projected to make landfall by midweek as a Category 3 storm.
*  This comes as the death toll from Hurricane Helene climbed to 232 people across six states.
*  Donald Trump seized on the disaster to push misinformation about the Biden-Harris administration
*  on the campaign trail, lying that federal authorities are denying help to Republicans
*  in the stricken areas and that federal funds are being diverted from recovery efforts to
*  house immigrants.
*  Federal and local officials have taken to the airwaves to refute Trump's, quote,
*  dangerous narrative.
*  This is Tennessee Governor Bill Lee.
*  There's no confiscation of supplies or of products coming in by FEMA or TEMA.
*  There's nothing, that commitment to serving the people in this state and those who spread
*  that kind of misinformation.
*  It's deeply unfortunate that that's happening.
*  That's Tennessee's Republican Governor Bill Lee.
*  Meanwhile, The Intercept reports prisoners in North Carolina were left in their cells
*  without running water or power for nearly a week, cut off from communication with the
*  outside world and forced to keep their waste and plastic bags in their cells.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
