*  any offense. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx4gyG9aGtY&t=423.16s)]
*  Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx4gyG9aGtY&t=424.16s)]

*  Now! Sunday night. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx4gyG9aGtY&t=451.16s)]
*  This has meant a lot for my family and myself because it stops the continued punishment [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx4gyG9aGtY&t=454.16s)]
*  that I have faced throughout the last two decades, where I every day was uncertain because [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx4gyG9aGtY&t=460.16s)]
*  I faced the possibility of deportation. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx4gyG9aGtY&t=466.16s)]

*  any sort of accompanying executive action. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx4gyG9aGtY&t=549.16s)]
*  Advocates say Biden could have taken a further step and ordered the National Archives to [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx4gyG9aGtY&t=553.16s)]
*  publish the amendment and enter it officially in the Constitution, a move which would have [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx4gyG9aGtY&t=557.16s)]
*  triggered a legal battle with Republicans. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx4gyG9aGtY&t=562.16s)]
