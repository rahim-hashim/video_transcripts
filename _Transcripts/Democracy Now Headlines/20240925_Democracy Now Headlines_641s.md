*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Tens of thousands of people have fled southern Lebanon as Israel's military continues its
*  intense artillery and missile attacks.
*  Lebanon's Health Ministry reports the death toll has climbed to at least 599 people, including
*  50 children.
*  Meanwhile, Hezbollah launched dozens of drones and rockets at Israel, including a long-range
*  missile fired toward Tel Aviv that was intercepted by Israeli air defense systems.
*  Israeli public media is reporting Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant is readying troops
*  ground invasion of Lebanon.
*  In Beirut, officials say they've secured shelters for 10,000 people displaced from
*  southern Lebanon.
*  Some of the evacuees were forced into the same shelters they fled to nearly two decades
*  ago during Israel's July 2006 assault.
*  This is Felya Messon, a 58-year-old man who narrowly survived a strike that destroyed
*  her family home.
*  The rocket landed in front of me.
*  I was shocked.
*  I couldn't hear or see after that.
*  Dust was all over the place, so I drove off quickly and headed to the upper road and kept
*  going.
*  I lost my temper because of what happened.
*  It took me 12 to 15 hours to reach Beirut from Aytut because of the traffic congestion.
*  The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reports two United Nations staffers were among those
*  killed by Israeli attacks on southern Lebanon.
*  Ali Basma worked as a janitor at the UNHCR's tire office for seven years before he was
*  killed in an Israeli strike on Monday.
*  And Dina Darwish, a UNHCR staffer featured in many of the agency's videos, was killed
*  along with her youngest son in an Israeli strike that seriously injured her husband
*  and her other child.
*  A separate Israeli strike killed cameraman Kamel Kariki of Aminar TV.
*  He's at least the fifth journalist killed by Israeli attacks on Lebanon since October
*  7th.
*  Meanwhile, Israel's military has continued its attacks on the Gaza Strip, with at least
*  53 Palestinians killed over the last 24 hours.
*  Among the dead, our mother killed along with her five children when Israel's military
*  bombed their house north of Rafeh.
*  In occupied West Bank, four Palestinians were shot and wounded as Israeli soldiers raided
*  the Fawar refugee camp south of Hebron.
*  Elsewhere, a Palestinian doctor was hospitalized in serious condition after he was shot by
*  Israeli forces during a raid near the city of Kaqilya.
*  Here in New York, world leaders gathered for the United Nations General Assembly Tuesday
*  condemned Israel's assaults on Palestine and Lebanon.
*  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza and
*  said the failure of nations to stop the violence showed the United Nations system and Western
*  values are dying.
*  Chilean President Gabriel Boric also condemned Israel's actions.
*  I refuse to choose between the Hamas' terrorism or the massacre and genocidal behavior of
*  Netanyahu's Israel.
*  We do not have to choose between barbarities.
*  I choose humanity.
*  We denounce the illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories and the de facto denial
*  of the existence of an independent Palestinian state by the occupying country.
*  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres accused Israel of violating the United Nations Charter
*  and said too many governments are turning a blind eye to international human rights
*  conventions and the decisions of international courts.
*  Meanwhile, Joe Biden delivered his last speech to the United Nations as U.S. president, calling
*  for a diplomatic solution to end Israel's war on Gaza, even as his administration continues
*  to provide weapons and billions of dollars in aid to Israel's military.
*  We're working to bring greater measure of peace and stability to the Middle East.
*  The world must not flinch from the horrors of October 7th.
*  Any country, any country, would have the right and responsibility to ensure that such an
*  attack could never happen again.
*  In Ukraine, at least three people were killed and nearly three dozen injured Tuesday as
*  a Russian bomb tore through an apartment block in Kharkiv.
*  Ukraine's military says it shot down scores of Iranian-made drones launched by Russia
*  as part of a wave of attacks that coincided with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's
*  visit to the United Nations General Assembly.
*  This comes as the Biden administration says it's sending Ukraine another $375 million
*  in military aid, including rockets, artillery and medium-range cluster bombs.
*  The Arizona Democratic Party says a campaign office for Vice President Kamala Harris in
*  Tempe was damaged by gunfire overnight Tuesday.
*  It's the second time bullet holes have appeared in the office's windows in recent weeks.
*  Harris is planning to visit Arizona in the coming days, where she's reportedly planning
*  to visit the U.S.-Mexico border.
*  Meanwhile, in Ohio, a Haitian immigrant rights group has brought criminal charges against
*  Donald Trump and J.D. Vance over their false claims that Haitian immigrants living in Springfield
*  are stealing and eating dogs and cats.
*  Ohio state law allows private citizens to file affidavits bringing criminal charges.
*  The Haitian Bridge Alliance wants Trump and Vance prosecuted for disrupting public services,
*  making false alarms, telecommunications harassment and aggravated menacing.
*  Last week, the group's executive director, Gerline Joseph, spoke with Democracy Now!
*  Those type of narratives, when they think they're only attacking one person, one community,
*  it has ripple effects.
*  The reality now in Springfield, the entire community's lives are at risk.
*  And what we are saying is currently this has been a tactic that's being used, fear, division,
*  and this is a time for all people in cities like Springfield to come together and fight
*  against those hateful speech that literally are creating those security issues in Springfield
*  and also in other places across the United States.
*  To see the full interview with Gerline Joseph of Haitian Bridge Alliance, go to democracynow.org.
*  West Virginia Independent Senator Joe Manchin says he will not endorse Kamala Harris for
*  president after she reiterated her support for ending the Senate filibuster.
*  She told Wisconsin Public Radio this week she would seek to lower the threshold to pass
*  legislation from 60 senators to a simple majority of 51 in order to restore abortion rights
*  lost when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.
*  That prompted this response by Senator Manchin.
*  Shame on you.
*  Shame on you.
*  She knows that filibuster is the holy grail of democracy.
*  Senator Manchin previously joined Republicans to filibuster the Women's Health Protection
*  Act, which would have codified abortion rights into federal law.
*  The chancellor of New York City's public school system is stepping down amidst a growing
*  federal bribery investigation.
*  David Banks' announcement comes just weeks after FBI agents raided his home and seized
*  his phone.
*  He's at least the fourth top official to resign from Mayor Eric Adams' administration
*  over a sprawling federal corruption probe, which, among other things, is looking into
*  whether Adams' campaign received illegal donations from Turkey.
*  Recently, Adams' lawyer abruptly resigned.
*  The state of Missouri has executed Marcellus Williams.
*  Despite new evidence suggesting he was wrongfully convicted, Williams died by lethal injection
*  Tuesday evening after the U.S. Supreme Court denied a stay.
*  He was 55 years old, a devout Muslim, an imam for other incarcerated people and a poet.
*  Jurors, the prosecutor and the murder victim's family all begged that he not be killed.
*  To see our coverage of his case, visit democracynow.org.
*  Meanwhile, Texas prison officials killed Travis James Mullis on Tuesday.
*  He's the fourth person to face lethal injection in Texas so far this year and the 16th nationwide,
*  part of five executions scheduled across the United States this week.
*  This comes as Texas lawmakers are urging authorities to grant clemency to death row prisoner Robert
*  Robertson, who was convicted in 2003 for the murder of his two-year-old daughter but has
*  always maintained his innocence.
*  Robertson's conviction was solely based on forensic testimony that cited the shaken
*  baby syndrome hypothesis, which was popularized in the early 2000s but never scientifically
*  validated.
*  Robertson is scheduled to be put to death October 17th.
*  This is Texas state representative Joe Moody of El Paso.
*  You cannot execute someone in a situation where there may not have been a crime committed.
*  And the evidence in Mr. Robertson's case is of such a degree and such a magnitude that
*  we have to push pause on this case.
*  There is no disagreement that the government taking the life of an innocent person is wrong.
*  And until we have these answers, this case cannot move forward.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
