# Top U.S. & World Headlines — October 4, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaQrYrc3rMA)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, Democracy Now!
*  The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel's military has carried out its heaviest airstrikes so far in Lebanon, with a reported
*  10 massive bombings overnight in Beirut's densely populated southern suburbs.
*  Lebanon's health minister reports at least 2,000 people have been killed since the start
*  of the Israeli attacks on Lebanon, including at least 127 children, most of them in the
*  last two weeks.
*  On Thursday, World Health Organization Director Tedros Adnan Ghebreyesus said Israeli attacks
*  had made it impossible for the WHO to deliver a large shipment of trauma and medical supplies
*  to Beirut.
*  He said Israeli strikes have killed 28 health workers in just one 24-hour span, while shuddering
*  dozens of hospitals and clinics.
*  In southern Lebanon, 37 health facilities have been closed, while in Beirut, three hospitals
*  have been forced to fully evacuate staff and patients, and another two were partially evacuated.
*  Many health workers are not reporting to duty as they fled the areas where they work
*  due to bombardments.
*  A Pentagon spokesperson said Thursday U.S. military leaders are consulting with their
*  Israeli counterparts on a response to Iran's ballistic missile attack earlier this week
*  on Israeli military bases and other security sites.
*  We continue to engage the Israelis, you know, very frequently.
*  We are certainly talking to them about their response, but what their response might be,
*  I'm just not going to speculate further on.
*  At the White House, President Biden acknowledged he'd spoken with Israeli leaders to discuss
*  possible attacks on Iran's oil infrastructure.
*  Would you support Israel striking Iran's oil facilities, sir?
*  We're in discussion about it.
*  I think that would be a little—anyway.
*  Biden had said that he did not support Israel striking Iran's nuclear facilities.
*  Biden's comment rattled energy markets, causing an immediate spike in crude oil prices.
*  Meanwhile, Iran has threatened an unconventional response to any Israeli retaliation, including
*  attacks targeting Israeli infrastructure.
*  Earlier today, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah al-Hammani led prayers in Tehran for the first
*  time in nearly five years.
*  As he commemorated Hezbollah leader Hassan al-Sarala, assassinated by Israel last week
*  in Lebanon, Hammani called on Muslim leaders to band together to confront Israel.
*  Meanwhile, Yemen's Houthis released video showing what appears to be an attack earlier
*  this week on the British oil vessel the Cordelia Moon in the Red Sea.
*  The Houthis have vowed to maintain a naval blockade until Israel halts its war on Lebanon
*  and the Palestinian territories.
*  Meanwhile, Israel continues its relentless attacks on Gaza, with Israeli forces blowing
*  up residential buildings near the Nusaydat camp and civilian homes in Deir Ebalah and
*  Qanyunas.
*  The Palestinian Health Ministry reports at least 14 people were killed and 50 wounded
*  over the last 24 hours.
*  Here in the United States, a group of nearly 100 physicians, nurses, surgeons and midwives
*  have sent a letter to President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris detailing, quote,
*  crimes beyond comprehension they witnessed in Gaza.
*  They're calling on the U.S. to support a ceasefire to end support for Israel's military
*  and to back an international arms embargo on Israel.
*  Part of the letter reads, quote,
*  An Israeli airstrike on the occupied West Bank has killed at least 18 Palestinians.
*  On Thursday, Israeli fighter jets targeted a crowded cafe in the Tulkaram refugee camp,
*  leaving behind twisted piles of wreckage and flaming debris.
*  This is Neema Fad, the brother of the cafe's owner, who was killed in the attack.
*  The missiles targeted a civilian building.
*  A family was wiped from the civil registry.
*  What was their fault?
*  The family was asleep in their house.
*  There's no safe place for the Palestinian people.
*  The Palestinian people have the right to defend themselves.
*  Israel's military claimed the bombing targeted the head of Hamas's infrastructure in Tulkaram.
*  It was the largest and deadliest airstrike in the occupied West Bank in more than two
*  decades.
*  Here in the United States, union dock workers along the East Coast and Gulf Coast have ended
*  a three-day strike and will resume negotiations for a new contract.
*  A tentative agreement on pay for some 45,000 members of the International Long Sherman's
*  Association will see workers' wages increase by 62 percent over the life of the contract.
*  The union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance will extend the existing contract until mid-January
*  to give negotiators more time to finalize a deal.
*  In more labor news, Boeing's revoked health care benefits for some 33,000 aerospace workers
*  who went on strike three weeks ago.
*  In a statement supporting the workers, Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders wrote,
*  quote,
*  "'Boeing's greed' offers another perfect example of why we need Medicare for all,"
*  Sanders said.
*  The death toll from Hurricane Helene has climbed to 213, making it one of the deadliest hurricanes
*  to hit the United States since modern record-keeping began, after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane
*  Maria.
*  Hundreds remain missing, and our fear dead.
*  More than half of the deaths were in North Carolina, where on Thursday private helicopter
*  companies joined efforts to bring aid to mountain communities cut off by flood damage.
*  This is pilot Brooke Barzik, who delivered food, water and other supplies to the hard-hit
*  Suwananoa Valley.
*  BROOK BARZIK, U.S. Maritime Alliance Member, North Carolina Department of Labor and Labor
*  Association It's absolute devastation.
*  Even just this valley through here is decimated.
*  And I think the one thing that stands out the most is, even after it had been several
*  days since it had happened, there still was no aid here at all.
*  Vice President Kamala Harris rallied supporters on Thursday in the city of Ripon, Wisconsin,
*  known as the birthplace of the Republican Party.
*  Harris was joined on stage by Republican and former Wyoming Congressmember Liz Cheney,
*  who's endorsed Harris for president.
*  Liz Cheney really is a leader who puts country above party and above self, a true patriot.
*  And it is my profound honor, my profound honor, to have your support.
*  Harris also thanked the Republican former vice president, Dick Cheney, Liz Cheney's
*  father, one of the most influential architects of George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq for
*  his endorsement.
*  Speaking to Harris' supporters, Liz Cheney took aim at Donald Trump, calling him petty,
*  During her three terms in Congress, Cheney voted against an assault weapons ban, earned
*  an A rating from the anti-abortion group Pro-Life America and expressed support for plans by
*  Israel to annex parts of the occupied West Bank.
*  Melania Trump has spoken publicly in favor of the right to have an abortion.
*  The former first lady made the remarks in a video teasing the release of her new self-titled
*  memoir.
*  Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that
*  all women possess from birth, individual freedom.
*  What does my body, my choice really mean?
*  Melania Trump's statement puts her at odds with most of the Republican Party, including
*  her husband Donald Trump, who's boasted about overturning the constitutional right to an
*  abortion.
*  On Saturday, Trump's planning to return to Butler, Pennsylvania to rally supporters
*  at the site of July's assassination attempt against him.
*  He'll be joined on stage by billionaire Elon Musk.
*  In Tennessee, three former Memphis police officers have been acquitted of violating
*  the civil rights of Tyree Nichols, a 29-year-old black father who died after the officers brutally
*  beat him during a traffic stop in January of last year.
*  The jury found just one of the officers, Demetrius Haley, guilty of the lesser charge
*  of violating Nichols' civil rights, causing bodily injury.
*  Haley, along with former officers Tedarius Beane and Justin Smith, were all found guilty
*  of witness tampering related to the cover-up of the deadly beating.
*  Two other officers, Emmett Martin and Desmond Mills Jr., pleaded guilty to federal civil
*  rights charges ahead of the trial.
*  To see our coverage of Tyree Nichols, go to democracynow.org.
*  In the Democratic Republic of Congo, at least 78 people were killed after a ferryboat capsized
*  in the eastern Lake Kivu.
*  Though local authorities say the death toll could be significantly higher as rescue efforts
*  continue, the disaster comes as an increasing number of people have been forced across Lake
*  Kivu, often in overcrowded vessels, as they attempt to reach Goma while avoiding travel
*  across territory plagued by fighting between Congolese government forces and M23 rebels.
*  Since there is no longer a road between Goma and Manova, many people are suffering.
*  What happened is the government's fault.
*  Only one boat, instead of two, left Manova today, and it took on double its usual load.
*  If the road was operational, vehicles could have transported some of the people and goods.
*  And Mexican authorities have arrested several soldiers involved in the fatal shooting Tuesday
*  of six asylum seekers who were aboard a truck with over a dozen others when the soldiers
*  opened fire.
*  At least 10 people were injured.
*  The group, many from Egypt, India and Pakistan, had recently crossed into the southern Mexican
*  state of Chiapas from Guatemala.
*  Mexico's newly inaugurated president, Claudia Schoenbaum, condemned the attack as deplorable
*  and called for an investigation.
*  Mexican soldiers and police have been widely accused of human rights violations, including
*  the massacre of asylum seekers, as Mexico collaborates with the Biden administration
*  and a crackdown on people seeking refuge in the United States.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
