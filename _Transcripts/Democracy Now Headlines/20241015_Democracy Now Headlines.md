# Top U.S. & World Headlines — October 15, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUA9zU50rsU)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel has intensified its ground assault on the northern Gaza Strip, where an estimated
*  400,000 people remain trapped amidst a dire humanitarian situation.
*  Over the past 24 hours, Israeli attacks have killed at least 55 Palestinians, including
*  10 people killed by an Israeli tank shell as they lined up for food at a distribution
*  center in Jabalia.
*  Dozens more were wounded in the assault, children among them.
*  On Monday, the World Health Organization began its second round of an emergency polio vaccination
*  campaign after Israel's assault decimated Gaza's water and sanitation infrastructure,
*  prompting a polio outbreak.
*  Children who brought their children to receive a booster dose said they have much more to
*  fear than the spread of disease.
*  Today, I came to vaccinate my children against polio.
*  We administered the first dose, and now we've administered the second dose, as we are scared
*  of diseases that are widely spread here in Gaza.
*  However, with disease and this fear, we fear the occupation more, because even though we
*  are protecting them and vaccinating them, the occupation is still bombing them.
*  One of the victims who burned to death after Israel bombed Al Aqsa Hospital early Monday
*  has been identified as 19-year-old Shaban Aldalu.
*  He was an engineering student at Gaza's Al-Azhar University, who just started his
*  studies in September of last year.
*  He built the tent shelter his family was living in when Israel bombed them.
*  At least four others were also killed in the fire.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces killed two Palestinians, including a child,
*  and injured four others during an hours-long assault Monday on the city of Jenin and its
*  refugee camp.
*  Twenty-three-year-old Mahmoud Mahmoud Abu Al-Rab died of gunshot wounds, as did 17-year-old
*  Rayan Ibrahim Al Sayed.
*  bring the death toll from Israeli assaults on the West Bank over the past year to 755,
*  including 165 children.
*  In Lebanon, at least 21 people were killed Monday when Israel bombed a four-story apartment
*  building in the northern village of Etou.
*  The U.N. Human Rights Commission reports 12 women and two children were among the victims.
*  On Monday, a top UNICEF official warned of a lost generation of children in Lebanon,
*  with some 400,000 youths among the estimated 1.2 million displaced by Israel's bombs.
*  This is Jalal Farhat, a 40-year-old father of five whose family crossed Lebanon's border
*  into Syria Monday seeking refuge.
*  JALAL FARHAT, Father of Five
*  There are strikes in our neighborhood and destruction, and they struck near my house.
*  I have children.
*  You can't just stay where you are.
*  We tried going to another place.
*  We moved from Baalbek, where they struck near my house.
*  We had to leave again.
*  I have children.
*  You can't stay.
*  We are going to Syria because it could be safer than where we are.
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu doubled down Monday in his warnings to the
*  U.N. interim force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, telling U.N. peacekeepers to quote,
*  request and to temporarily get out of harm's way, unquote.
*  BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli Prime Minister
*  The charge that Israel deliberately attacked UNIFIL personnel is completely false.
*  It's exactly the opposite.
*  Israel repeatedly asked UNIFIL to get out of harm's way.
*  Netanyahu's remarks came after Israeli troops fired on a UNIFIL watch tower and destroyed
*  part of a UNIFIL base near the Israeli border.
*  At least five UNIFIL peacekeepers have been injured by Israel's assaults.
*  Despite the repeated attacks, UNIFIL's chief has said peacekeepers will remain in their
*  positions.
*  On Monday, Britain, France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement calling Israel's
*  attacks on U.N. peacekeepers a violation of international law.
*  And the EU's foreign policy chief, Joseph Borrell, condemned Israel's attacks on UNIFIL
*  as unacceptable.
*  JOSEPH BORRELL, EU Chief of Staff, UNIFIL
*  The 27 members agreed on asking Israel to stop attacking UNIFIL.
*  Many European members are participating in this mission.
*  Their work is very important.
*  It's completely unacceptable attacking United Nations troops.
*  The Guardian is reporting, USAID officials have been holding regular meetings with Israeli
*  counterparts at Israel's notorious Dei Teman prison since late July, after the Israeli
*  agency overseeing aid relocated to the military base.
*  Dei Teman has been labeled a torture camp, where Palestinians abducted by Israeli soldiers
*  in Gaza have described harrowing physical, sexual and psychological abuse.
*  The Guardian says it's not clear if the USAID workers have observed the part of the
*  base that is used as a torture camp, but affected officials told the newspaper, quote,
*  "'I can't sleep at night knowing that it's going on,' unquote, and that Israel's
*  relocation of its aid coordination group to the prison, quote, seems like trolling,'
*  unquote.
*  You can see our past coverage of Dei Teman and the reports on it at democracynow.org.
*  Here in New York City, hundreds of Jewish activists and their allies rallied outside
*  the New York Stock Exchange Monday demanding an Israeli arms embargo and an end to war
*  profiteering by companies like Raytheon and Lockheed Martin.
*  Police forcibly removed peaceful protesters as they blocked the entrance to the Stock
*  Exchange, arresting over 200 people, among the largest mass arrests outside the Stock
*  Exchange in history.
*  Their headlines will speak with Elena Stein, director of organizing and strategy for Jewish
*  Voice for Peace.
*  She was detained at Monday's action.
*  Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., activists with Code Pink disrupted an annual conference
*  at the Association of the U.S. Army.
*  Canada has expelled six Indian diplomats amidst mounting tensions over the murder last year
*  of a Sikh separatist leader in British Columbia.
*  India responded by announcing it's also expelling six Canadian diplomats this week.
*  New Delhi's rejected Canadian accusations that Indian government agents were involved
*  in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijer and the targeting of other Indian dissidents in
*  Canada.
*  This is Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
*  Canada is a country rooted in the rule of law, and the protection of our citizens is
*  paramount.
*  That's why, when our law enforcement and intelligence officials began pursuing credible
*  allegations that agents of the government of India were directly involved in the killing
*  of a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijer, on Canadian soil, we responded.
*  And in North Carolina, the Rutherford County Sheriff's Department has arrested a man
*  who allegedly used an assault rifle to threaten workers helping with relief efforts from Hurricane
*  Helene.
*  Investigators charged 44-year-old William Jacob Parsons with the crime of going armed
*  the public, a misdemeanor.
*  The incident and other cases of threats and harassment against federal workers prompted
*  FEMA to briefly suspend some of its North Carolina relief operations.
*  FEMA pulled back its workers from going door to door in areas hard hit by hurricane damage.
*  This comes after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance
*  spent weeks spreading lies and conspiracy theories about FEMA, falsely claiming the
*  agency sent aid meant for hurricane victims to migrants while withholding aid to people
*  in Republican areas.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman in New York, joined by Democracy Now!'s Juan González in Chicago.
*  Hi Juan, and happy birthday.
*  Hi Amy, thank you and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and
*  around the world.
