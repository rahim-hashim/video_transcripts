# Top U.S. & World Headlines — October 25, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbuNlG2DTzo)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In northern Gaza, Israeli soldiers have launched a full-scale attack on Jabalia.
*  Details are still emerging on what a Gaza civil defense spokesperson described as a
*  major massacre, with more than 150 people killed or injured as Israeli forces took down
*  a dozen residential buildings.
*  Israeli forces stormed Kamel Adwan Hospital, expelling patients and staff after earlier
*  surrounding and shelling what was essentially the last hospital left standing in the area.
*  Soldiers carried out mass arrests.
*  Doctors say babies and children have died after being cut off from their oxygen supplies.
*  Kamel Adwan's director, Dr. Hossam Abu Safiyah, says the situation is catastrophic, that there
*  is nowhere patients in northern Gaza can go for treatment.
*  After headlines, we'll go to northern Gaza to speak with the acting director of Kamel
*  Adwan, Mohamed Salha.
*  Israeli attacks in the southern Gaza Strip continue as well, and in Khan Yunis, at least
*  38 people were killed by Israel, including 14 children from the same family.
*  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says he expects Gaza ceasefire talks to resume
*  in the coming days in Doha, in Lebanon.
*  An Israeli strike killed three journalists as they slept in a guest house in the southern
*  town of Hasbaya.
*  Israel did not issue any evacuation orders for the area before the strike.
*  The victims were Omayyeddin journalist Qasem Najjar and Mohamed Reda and Wissam Qasim of
*  Aminar TV.
*  Omayyeddin reporter Abbas Saba addressed his colleagues' killing earlier today from Lebanon.
*  Abbas Saba, Israeli Press Secretary
*  Israel targeted journalists in Hasbaya, knowing that the area is known for the gathering of
*  journalists.
*  This enemy that looks for civilian targets after it's drained its military targets
*  and lost in the field is now targeting journalists.
*  Lebanon's information minister called the attack a war crime.
*  The official death toll from Israel's assault on Lebanon is nearing 2,600.
*  In Russia, 36 world leaders have wrapped up a summit of the BRICS alliance, led by Brazil,
*  Russia, India, China and South Africa, with a pledge to add 13 new partners.
*  The newly expanded BRICS will include Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan,
*  Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.
*  Venezuela failed in its bid to join BRICS after Brazil vetoed its admission.
*  The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has said he would not accept the
*  result of July's election, in which Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro claimed to narrowly
*  win re-election.
*  We'll have more on the BRICS summit later in the broadcast.
*  In the Philippines, Tropical Storm Trami has killed at least 26 people after dumping torrential
*  the main island of Luzon.
*  At least 14 of the deaths were in Batangas province.
*  I was panicking.
*  I was looking for my child.
*  He was missing.
*  When I got here, all the houses were gone.
*  Everything was buried in mud.
*  There was also two residents looking for their family under the mud.
*  The United Nations Environment Program warns without dramatic cuts to greenhouse gas emissions,
*  the world will face an inevitable and catastrophic temperature rise of 3.1 degrees Celsius by
*  the end of the century.
*  U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres issued a stark warning as he announced the findings.
*  The message of today's emissions gap report is clear.
*  We are tittering on a planetary tightrope.
*  Either leaders bridge the emissions gap or we plunge headlong into climate disaster with
*  the poorest and most vulnerable suffering the most.
*  King Charles has joined leaders of 56 nations, most of them former British colonies, for
*  the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which opened today in Samoa's capital, Apia.
*  Two dozen of the Commonwealth nations are small island states, making the threat of
*  rising seas and worsening tropical storms a priority at this year's summit.
*  A new report finds the Commonwealth's three wealthiest members, Australia, Canada and
*  the United Kingdom, are responsible for 60 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions, even
*  though they comprise just 6 percent of the Commonwealth's population.
*  Ahead of the talks, Tuvalu's prime minister called on nations to back a fossil fuel non-proliferation
*  treaty.
*  To put it plainly, it is a deaf sentence, not phrases that I use lightly, for us Tuvalu
*  if larger nations continue to increase their emission levels.
*  A fossil fuel treaty will be a global mechanism essential for managing a just transition away
*  from coal, oil and gas.
*  Meanwhile, King Charles has refused calls by African and Caribbean nations to pay reparations
*  and make amends for Britain's role in the transatlantic slave trade.
*  In remarks opening the Commonwealth Summit, Charles stopped short of an apology.
*  He instead acknowledged painful aspects of Britain's past.
*  The Mozambique protests broke out after Daniel Chapo of the ruling Fulimo party was announced
*  the winner of a disputed presidential election Thursday.
*  I don't believe that Fulimo won.
*  I think Fulimo did what they always do.
*  What's happening today is people are suffering.
*  Chapo's biggest rival, Venancio Mondelain, has called on supporters to keep taking to
*  the streets in protest.
*  Earlier this week, police deployed tear gas and fired on demonstrators who rallied after
*  the murder of Mondelain's lawyer and a party official.
*  The biggest problems in this year's election included Mozambique's debt crisis, corruption,
*  climate change-driven disasters and a violent insurgency in the north of the country.
*  Here in New York, a group of protesters gathered outside the Dominican Consulate in the Bronx
*  Thursday to denounce the mass deportation of Haitians by the Dominican Republic.
*  Earlier this month, the Dominican president Luis Abinader announced a campaign to expel
*  up to 10,000 Haitians a week, citing an excess of immigrants.
*  In the last three weeks, over 27,000 people have been deported to Haiti.
*  This is Dr. Saudi Garcia.
*  We're saying no more to mass deportation.
*  We are saying no more to anti-Haitian violence, centuries of anti-Haitian violence.
*  We are saying no more to allowing our own rights to be violated, to be able to push
*  somebody else down.
*  That is not how we build a better Dominican Republic.
*  We are saying no more to allowing our own rights to be violated, to be able to push
*  somebody else down.
*  That is not how we build a better Dominican Republic.
*  We are saying no more to allowing our own rights to be violated, to be able to push
*  somebody else down.
*  That is not how we build a better Dominican Republic.
*  The expulsions come, as the U.N. says.
*  More than 10,000 Haitians were internally displaced over the past week after fleeing
*  gang attacks around the capital, Port-au-Prince.
*  In campaign news, Donald Trump rallied in Tempe, Arizona, Thursday, where he unleashed
*  another torrent of anti-immigrant hate speech.
*  Trump deployed a similar hate-filled rhetoric at another Thursday rally in Las Vegas, where
*  he also claimed he was leading by a lot in swing states, even as most polls put him
*  neck and neck with Kamala Harris.
*  Meanwhile, in Clarkston, Georgia, Kamala Harris shared the stage with Barack Obama for the
*  first time during her campaign as she touted her support for abortion rights, her proposals
*  to lift up the middle class.
*  The star-studded rally included Spike Lee, Samuel L. Jackson and Tyler Perry in a performance
*  from Bruce Springsteen.
*  precarious situations.
*  And President Biden is visiting the Gila Crossing Community School in Arizona today, where he'll
*  issue a formal apology for government-run Native American boarding schools, which separated
*  indigenous families and sought to eliminate Native cultures.
*  The U.S. government operated hundreds of these schools from 1819 to 1969, where children
*  reported severe physical and psychological abuse.
*  An Interior Department investigation this year found nearly 1,000 children died while
*  at the schools.
*  Biden will be accompanied by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first-ever Native American
*  Cabinet secretary.
*  Haaland is a member of the Pueblo of Laguna.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
