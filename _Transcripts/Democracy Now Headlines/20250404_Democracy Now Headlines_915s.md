"Can't Look Away: The Case Against Social Media" is a new documentary that exposes the real-life consequences of the algorithms of big tech companies and their impact on children and teens. In 2022, social media companies made an estimated $11 billion advertising to minors in the U.S., where 95% of teenagers use social media. One in three teens uses social media almost constantly. "These products, they're not designed to hook us, adults," says Laura Marquez-Garrett, an attorney at the Social Media Victims Law Center in Seattle who is featured in "Can't Look Away."

*  These products were specifically designed to be addictive to adolescent brains and this [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=115.74s)]

*  What's the difference? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=141.58s)]
*  This is the first case that's ever been tried this way. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=142.58s)]
*  Based on the design of their algorithm, based on the design of their platform, not the content. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=145.5s)]
*  My son and his girlfriend had had disagreements. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=152.38000000000002s)]

*  content. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=161.18s)]
*  These companies have been gaslighting us for years. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=163.54000000000002s)]
*  This is all about money. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=166.26000000000002s)]
*  The purpose of all commercial ventures is to create a demand. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=168.17999999999998s)]
*  Our children are the casualties. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=172.7s)]
*  We need to take back the power from these companies. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=174.14s)]
*  They created a dangerous situation and then manipulated these kids. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=177.77999999999997s)]
*  They know the levels of addiction, sexual abuse, they know the levels of suicide. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=181.54s)]
*  They're not showing our kids what they want to see. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=187.38s)]
*  They're showing you what they can't look away from. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=190.66s)]
*  We all feel empathy for the plaintiffs and their losses. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=194.14s)]
*  But plaintiffs have not and indeed cannot assert any legal theory under which SNAP would [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=200.14s)]
*  be held accountable. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=205.22s)]
*  These parents are going out there every day and re-traumatizing themselves. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=208.1s)]
*  I'll never see his face again or hear his laugh. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=211.77999999999997s)]
*  If this can save even one person, it'll be worth it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=215.14s)]
*  This is the fight I've been training for for 30 years. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=223.14s)]
*  All right, let's go to war. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=227.14s)]
*  Can't Look Away. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=234.14s)]
*  Can't Look Away, the case against social media, a new documentary directed by the award-winning [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=239.14s)]
*  film team Matthew O'Neill and Perry Peltz, inspired by an investigation into child safety [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=245.66s)]
*  online by Bloomberg News journalist Olivia Carville. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=252.58s)]
*  Today, Olivia wins a George Polk Award for her reporting. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=256.58000000000004s)]
*  And the film begins streaming on Jolt and also starts a theatrical release, a theatrical [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=262.34000000000003s)]
*  run here in New York City at DCTV's Firehouse Cinema, DCTV where Democracy Now! used to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=269.42s)]
*  broadcast from. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=275.94s)]
*  We're joined now by the director Matthew O'Neill and the lawyer featured in Can't [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=276.94s)]
*  Look Away, Laura Marquez Garrett, an attorney at the Social Media Victims Law Center in [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=281.22s)]
*  Seattle, which represents 4,000 children. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=286.82000000000005s)]
*  We welcome you both to Democracy Now! [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=291.1s)]
*  Matt, first talk about why you did this film. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=292.70000000000005s)]
*  You know, when Perry and I were first introduced to this subject through Olivia's reporting [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=294.62s)]
*  and through the team at Bloomberg News, we had that sense that probably many of your [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=299.38000000000005s)]
*  listeners and watchers have that social media is vaguely bad, that it's invading kids' [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=303.26000000000005s)]
*  lives, that it's leading to addiction or too much screen time. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=309.5s)]
*  As we got into the cases and we met the families that the Social Media Victims Law Center represent [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=313.5s)]
*  and we learned the details and we heard from Laura and from Matt, it overwhelmed us because [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=319.06s)]
*  it is so much worse than you imagined, so much worse than we ever imagined what's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=324.78s)]
*  being fed to children on all of these social media apps. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=330.38s)]
*  So, Laura Marquez Garrett, you were this high-end lawyer in Seattle coroner office. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=335.06s)]
*  Your future was made. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=343.53999999999996s)]
*  Your kids would be very well taken care of. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=345.82s)]
*  You have four of them? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=347.58s)]
*  I do. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=348.58s)]
*  Four small children, I guess. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=349.58s)]
*  And two are identical twins? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=350.58s)]
*  Yes, the oldest. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=352.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=353.9s)]
*  But you decided to leave that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=354.9s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=357.58s)]
*  Because I have four small children. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=359.5s)]
*  And so, when I, you know, at the time, they're young enough, my oldest are nine, and I was [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=361.24s)]
*  not aware of what was happening. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=365.08s)]
*  And when I first heard and I met Matthew Bergman, our founder, I said, well, what social media [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=366.72s)]
*  harms? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  I had no idea what was happening. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  When I met with him and read his first complaint, Selena Rodriguez, an 11-year-old who died [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  by suicide about two years after she got her first iPad, I then watched Social Dilemma [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=378.72s)]
*  on Netflix. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=384.6s)]
*  And when I saw these designers saying, you know, of course we don't let our children [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=386.64s)]
*  use these products, the attorney in me, Defense Bar, I was a member of the Defense Bar, by [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  the way, not a plaintiff's attorney, the attorney in me said if these manufacturers and designers [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=393.6s)]
*  and distributors don't let their own children use these products, they're not only harming [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=398.72s)]
*  kids, but they know it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=402.84000000000003s)]
*  Tell us the story of 16-year-old Mason Edens. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  Mason Edens, a young man in Arkansas, a friend's family, no history of mental illness, and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=408.44s)]
*  he goes through heartbreak. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=415.64s)]
*  He goes through a breakup. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=417.2s)]
*  And his parents, the devices, they keep an eye on him. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  They make sure that he's not watching them too much. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=422.72s)]
*  What they don't realize is that that TikTok algorithm, when it turns, it can turn fast. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=428.04s)]
*  And Mason is going through heartbreak. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=433.6s)]
*  So as he's looking for things like inspirational quotes, motivational speeches, TikTok begins [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=435.88s)]
*  to send him heartbreak and even suicide. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=440.92s)]
*  I mean, we have a screenshot where he says, I think it's inspirational quote, and he [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=443.76s)]
*  gets sort of the she never loved you, she never will. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=447.36s)]
*  I want to go to this 2022 case. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=450.8s)]
*  I hate to call Mason a case. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=455.04s)]
*  His mom is Jenny DeSereo. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=457.6s)]
*  He dies at 16. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=460.08000000000004s)]
*  She later examined his phone, as you're describing, and finds these TikTok videos [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=461.6s)]
*  that he liked that directly promoted suicide, some of which remained on the platform more [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  than a year later. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=474.08000000000004s)]
*  This is DeSereo, his mom, speaking to the Scrolling to Death podcast. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=475.7s)]
*  What I didn't realize is how quickly an algorithm can change. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=481.65999999999997s)]
*  I didn't realize that overnight, literally liking one video, an algorithm can completely [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=489.02s)]
*  flip. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=496.82s)]
*  And so in less than two weeks' time, the algorithm flipped on TikTok. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=498.46s)]
*  So I was that parent that was involved. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=506.82s)]
*  So I don't know, Laura, that people really understand when you say, oh, the algorithm [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=510.84s)]
*  and it sends him down this suicide path. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=515.42s)]
*  Explain exactly what happened. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=519.62s)]
*  So I want to start by saying what many adults don't realize is that these products, they're [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=521.46s)]
*  not designed to hook us adults. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=525.46s)]
*  They're designed to hook children. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=527.46s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=528.46s)]
*  There's internal documents that say, get them young, the younger the better. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=529.46s)]
*  Literally, that's a direct quote. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=531.9000000000001s)]
*  And so these products work differently for kids. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=534.1800000000001s)]
*  So when Mason Edens is depressed and sad, the platforms know that and they exploit it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=536.82s)]
*  And so when he is searching for inspirational quotes, if they were to show him things like, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=543.74s)]
*  hey, it'll be OK, go talk to your parents, go get some sunshine, right, what would he [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=548.46s)]
*  do? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=552.5400000000001s)]
*  He'd stop using. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=553.5400000000001s)]
*  And they don't want these children to stop using. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=554.82s)]
*  They program for engagement. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=556.58s)]
*  So what parents need to understand, everyone needs to understand, our children are having [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=558.0200000000001s)]
*  a very different experience on these products. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=562.62s)]
*  It is not only the content that's being sent, it's the volume, it's the manner, it's the [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=565.22s)]
*  overwhelming nature and the addiction that various mechanisms are creating such that [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=570.1s)]
*  they cannot look away. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=575.34s)]
*  Why are teens particularly vulnerable? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=577.1800000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's a very obvious question. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=579.26s)]
*  Well, no, it's the development of their frontal lobe. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=580.86s)]
*  And in fact, there are public meta documents with brain scan pictures saying like they're [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=583.74s)]
*  more vulnerable until they're about 24, 25, because the development of their frontal lobe, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=587.34s)]
*  they're more. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=592.94s)]
*  I mean, think about how our children act. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=593.94s)]
*  Look, I have young children and sometimes I'm like, where like what is going through [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=595.26s)]
*  their head? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=598.62s)]
*  They have not yet their frontal lobe is not developed. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=599.8s)]
*  They don't have the same reasoning or judgment that we do. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=602.14s)]
*  Charles Barr worked as an ad sales manager for TikTok in Germany. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=604.9s)]
*  In 2021, he grew concerned about the app's algorithms pushing dangerous content, so he [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=610.02s)]
*  alerted company leaders, but his warnings went unheeded. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=615.5799999999999s)]
*  Let's go back to another clip from Can't Look Away. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=619.46s)]
*  It starts with Barr. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=623.38s)]
*  I think TikTok as an app has a positive side when it comes down to impacting culture. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=625.6999999999999s)]
*  But what I see is that the platform is really not a safe environment for anybody within [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=631.3s)]
*  the young audience. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=638.38s)]
*  AI is pushing content that they know will be provocative, something fearful or anger [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=639.38s)]
*  inducing because we know that the more kids are steered towards this emotional content, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=644.6999999999999s)]
*  the longer they'll stay online. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=649.8199999999999s)]
*  We asked hundreds of thousands of teenagers, have you ever received unwanted sexual advances [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=651.3s)]
*  on Instagram? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=656.1999999999999s)]
*  One in eight, 13 to 15 year olds. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=657.1999999999999s)]
*  Yes, in the last seven days. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=659.38s)]
*  If it has anything to do with drugs, it's going to be on Snapchat. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=661.42s)]
*  This is where it is 90% of the time. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=664.66s)]
*  They're petrified of being held responsible for the deaths of minors. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=666.7800000000001s)]
*  It's a perfect storm of corporate greed for maximum profitability. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=671.46s)]
*  So it started with Charles Barr. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=677.0600000000001s)]
*  Matt O'Neill, if you can explain and also talk about fentanyl and drug use and what [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=679.34s)]
*  TikTok has to do, for example, with this. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=684.58s)]
*  There is a huge discussion about TikTok right now, like, is it going to go dark? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=688.1800000000001s)]
*  Who's going to buy it? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=692.1s)]
*  But this is not the discussion that's taking place. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=693.6600000000001s)]
*  So much of the conversation is about foreign policy in China and who owns it. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=696.02s)]
*  What Charles is bringing to the fore is this sense that TikTok entraps children, that it's [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=699.78s)]
*  not what they're looking for. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=705.66s)]
*  I think we think sometimes you use social media to look up a news topic or you think [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=707.46s)]
*  that these kids might be searching for drugs or suicide. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=713.0600000000001s)]
*  That's not what's happening. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=716.82s)]
*  They're being fed this content. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=718.1800000000001s)]
*  It's not their choice. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=720.34s)]
*  These aren't bad kids. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=721.46s)]
*  The parents aren't bad parents. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=723.14s)]
*  They're just without any real recourse in terms of facing these billion dollar corporations. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=725.36s)]
*  When it comes to fentanyl-laced pills, it's Snapchat. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=732.04s)]
*  Snapchat has become a platform where young people have access to drug dealers. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=735.28s)]
*  And the unique way their messages disappear is really appealing to someone who wants to [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=740.44s)]
*  sell drugs to a minor. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=746.36s)]
*  And these fentanyl-laced pills that young people are often buying thinking that they're [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=747.88s)]
*  They don't know that they're buying fentanyl has led to an unbelievable number of deaths. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=753.16s)]
*  We just saw the trailer and in it is a young man who's in a wheelchair. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=758.1999999999999s)]
*  Laura, tell us his story. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=763.6s)]
*  He didn't die. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=765.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=766.36s)]
*  Well, his heart stopped several times, right? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=767.36s)]
*  And actually, so I was going to say, I mean, this is the stories that the stories people [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=769.16s)]
*  need to hear, the truth of what's happening. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=772.86s)]
*  I have talked to many, many children who have said the same story over and over, which is [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=774.88s)]
*  I wanted to use Snapchat for the silly filters. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=781.36s)]
*  You know, my coach, my parents, my teacher showed them to me. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=784.24s)]
*  I began using Snapchat. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=787.5600000000001s)]
*  I had never heard of marijuana. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=789.0s)]
*  And all of the sudden, my feeds are filled with it. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=791.0s)]
*  I'm getting these quick ad recommendations. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=793.44s)]
*  And Snap says, this is your friend. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=795.24s)]
*  Not only do they say to children, we tell them watch out for strangers. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=796.96s)]
*  So Snap said, OK, this is your friend. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=799.4s)]
*  And I'm going to give you points when you snap this person. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=802.08s)]
*  You may know them. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=804.66s)]
*  This is what it's all about. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=805.66s)]
*  This is fun. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=806.66s)]
*  They make it look safe. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=807.66s)]
*  And so I talked to these children who say, look, I'd never heard of drugs. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=809.24s)]
*  And then I'm getting drug menus. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=812.48s)]
*  And Snap is saying, this is your friend. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=813.92s)]
*  I'll give you streaks and scores and trophies and charms. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=815.2s)]
*  And so I add them. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=818.32s)]
*  And now I've got drug menus. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=819.32s)]
*  And by the way, now it looks cool. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=820.6s)]
*  Like there's kids my age doing this. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=822.52s)]
*  And what do the CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg understand? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=824.48s)]
*  We only have 30 seconds. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=828.4s)]
*  Everything. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=829.88s)]
*  They know. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=830.88s)]
*  They know. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=831.88s)]
*  And what does that mean? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=833.24s)]
*  How are you holding them accountable? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=834.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=836.92s)]
*  Social media victims represents 4,000 kids. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=837.92s)]
*  They are putting profits over people. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=841.12s)]
*  They have known for years that they are hurting children. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=842.92s)]
*  They have concealed that fact from all of us. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=845.12s)]
*  They have told us their products were safe so that they can make billions and billions [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=848.2199999999999s)]
*  of dollars with no accountability. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=851.4599999999999s)]
*  And until we start holding them accountable, they have no reason to change. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=853.62s)]
*  Laura Marquez-Garrett is a lawyer with the Social Media Victims Law Center in Seattle. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=858.8s)]
*  The film centers around her and many of the victims of social media. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=864.9s)]
*  Matthew O'Neill is the co-director of the new documentary Can't Look Away. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=870.06s)]
*  And Matt, where can people start watching it today? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJZdyHkwvg&t=874.62s)]
