# Advocates: NY Prison Guard Strike Reveals History of Repression & Violence Against Prison Activism
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc)
*  Democracy depends on a free press. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=0.0s)]
*  Please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=2.4s)]
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=7.68s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Juan González. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=10.0s)]
*  We end today's show here in New York, where state prison guards are on the second week [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  of a wildcat strike over what they say are unsafe conditions. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=15.46s)]
*  The National Guard have been called in. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=19.32s)]
*  Some say the timing of the strike is curious. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=21.28s)]
*  It started the same week charges were filed against prison guards at the Marcy Correctional [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=23.44s)]
*  Facility in Utica, New York, who brutally beat to death handcuffed prisoner Robert Brooks [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=28.02s)]
*  in an attack captured on video footage by body cameras. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=33.14s)]
*  Brooks was black. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=38.62s)]
*  All the officers who took turns beating him appear to be white. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=40.46s)]
*  Meanwhile, prison officials have responded to the prison guards' strike by indefinitely [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=45.06s)]
*  suspending provisions in New York's Halt Solitary Act, which stands for Humane Alternatives [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  to Long-Term Solitary Confinement, which limits solitary confinement to 15 consecutive days [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=55.5s)]
*  or 20 days over a 60-day period. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=59.94s)]
*  For more, we've got two guests with us. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=62.4s)]
*  In Washington, D.C., Orsanmi Burton is assistant professor of anthropology at American University, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=64.48s)]
*  author of a book about the 1971 Attica prison uprising upstate New York titled Tip of the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=70.22s)]
*  Spear, Black Radicalism, Prison Repression and the Long Attica Revolt. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=75.58s)]
*  And here in our New York studio is José Saldana, director of Release Aging People [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=80.56s)]
*  in Prison, known as RAP. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=86.72s)]
*  He was released from New York state prison in 2018 after 38 years behind bars. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=88.7s)]
*  We welcome you both to Democracy Now! [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=93.92s)]
*  José, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  You're just back from the state capital here in New York, from Albany. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  Talk about the significance of the Wildcat Strike and how it's affecting the prisoners. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=101.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, for those who don't know, this is an illegal strike. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=106.12s)]
*  The correction guards had just finished negotiating a contract a few months ago, and now they [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=112.4s)]
*  are going on strike. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=118.52s)]
*  And the reason why they are going on strike is because the world saw that video. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=120.92s)]
*  We call it a lynching. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=127.52s)]
*  Fourteen to sixteen correction prison guards lynched a black man. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=130.56s)]
*  And the whole world saw it, and they're questioning how long has this been going on in the prison [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=136.84s)]
*  system. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=141.76000000000002s)]
*  So this illegal strike is to erase that consciousness that's building. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=143.16s)]
*  We are building a consciousness to dismantle that type of racial brutality and sexual violence [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  in the prison systems that have been going on for decades. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  They're trying to erase that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  And, José, could you talk about their demand that the reforms around solitary confinement [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=162.48s)]
*  be removed? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=171.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=173.48s)]
*  What the Solitary Confinement Act repealed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=174.48s)]
*  And the solitary confinement does not only restrict them from putting people in the box [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=178.84s)]
*  for decades, actual decades, it also stops them from putting pregnant women in the box, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=184.4s)]
*  women breastfeeding in the box, people who have mental health problems, people who have [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=191.08s)]
*  physical disabilities, paralyzed people wheelchair bound. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=198.08s)]
*  It prohibits them from putting these people in solitary confinement. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  They're trying to repeal that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=205.72s)]
*  They're trying to say that this whole solitary confinement had made their work dangerous. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=207.16s)]
*  It had created a dangerous environment and they actually are trying to erase what we [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=213.44s)]
*  saw in that video. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=219.6s)]
*  The people who are living in a dangerous environment are the incarcerated men and women. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=221.11999999999998s)]
*  Is it true that a prisoner died this week? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=225.2s)]
*  I'm not talking the one who was beaten to death. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=228.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=230.04s)]
*  One that has been reported. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=231.04s)]
*  A 61-year-old man? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=232.04s)]
*  At least one person has been reported to have died since then. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=233.04s)]
*  And this is after the National Guard were moved into these prison facilities. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=238.04s)]
*  Yeah, I wanted to bring in Orisonne Burton, assistant professor of anthropology at American [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=241.92s)]
*  University, author of The Tip of the Spear, Black Radicalism, Prison Repression, and the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=248.92s)]
*  Long Attica Revolt. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=254.76s)]
*  Could you talk somewhat about the role of correction officers, especially in your book [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=256.56s)]
*  on Attica? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=264.32s)]
*  You went back in time, of course, the Attica Revolt being one of the biggest in American [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=265.68s)]
*  history and its impact on reforms within the prison system. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=270.52s)]
*  Yes, well, the role of the guards is really to enforce domination. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=274.67999999999995s)]
*  And José was exactly right in talking about the role of solitary confinement, all of this, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=282.2s)]
*  of course. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=288.08s)]
*  A repeal of the Halt Act is really the primary demand of the guards. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=289.08s)]
*  And this is a legacy of Attica. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  So in the wake of the Attica Rebellion, we saw nationally the proliferation of solitary [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=295.4s)]
*  confinement and the extension of the lengths of time to which people were subjected to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  solitary confinement. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=306.0s)]
*  And this was really an effort to assert control and domination over the prison population. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  People might be aware of this popular narrative that solitary confinement is about confining [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=314.29999999999995s)]
*  the worst of the worst. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=319.02s)]
*  But you just heard from José the different categories of people that the Halt Act was [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=320.52s)]
*  designed to prevent from being put into solitary confinement. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=324.62s)]
*  And there's also a pronounced political dimension to the use of solitary confinement. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=328.3s)]
*  So, for instance, in the 1980s, the warden of the Marion Control Unit, which is a supermax [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=333.34s)]
*  prison in Illinois, said that the purpose of the Marion Solitary Confinement Unit is [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=338.94s)]
*  to control revolutionary attitudes within the prison system and within the society at [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=344.7s)]
*  large. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=350.09999999999997s)]
*  So part of this is the use of the prison as a form of counterrevolution. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=351.18s)]
*  And the guards are really in place to enforce that dominance and to ensure that prisons [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=356.3s)]
*  remain quiet. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=362.1s)]
*  And for the most part, people don't hear about it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=363.1s)]
*  But because this video was released, people have no choice but to be faced with the kinds [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=366.18s)]
*  of violence that happen all the time in prisons. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  Professor, if you could talk about—and you talk a lot about this in your book, What You [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=375.1s)]
*  Think Needs to Happen Now, the whole issue of abolition versus reforms as the legacy [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=379.7s)]
*  of what happened after Attica. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=385.74s)]
*  And explain what happened then. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=387.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=389.62s)]
*  So, I mean, the dominant narrative of Attica is that it's a four-day rebellion that unfolded [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=390.62s)]
*  largely within Attica Prison and that the demands were primarily oriented towards improving [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=396.34s)]
*  prison conditions. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=401.62s)]
*  I don't think that that's wrong. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=403.53999999999996s)]
*  I just think that it's incomplete. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=404.9s)]
*  My book shows that Attica was a protracted struggle that lasted for at least 13 months, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=406.88s)]
*  that it traversed multiple prisons, and that it was revolutionary and abolitionist in its [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=412.11999999999995s)]
*  politics, that it was informed by anti-colonial movements unfolding throughout the world, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=417.47999999999996s)]
*  and that it had material links to those movements. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=422.91999999999996s)]
*  Part of the response to Attica was massive repression and violence, as many of your viewers [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  will know. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=430.46s)]
*  The focus on the intense violence waged by the state often obscures the extent to which [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=432.12s)]
*  reforms were used as a counterinsurgency method designed to suppress political consciousness [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=438.23999999999995s)]
*  and suppress activism. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=446.08s)]
*  And so, one of those reforms was the proliferation of solitary confinement, as I just mentioned. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=448.74s)]
*  Other reforms were just the proliferation of prisons in general, which were used as [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=455.5s)]
*  a method to separate out more prisoners so that they couldn't organize. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=462.5s)]
*  But importantly, the proliferation of prisons was also used as a way to market prison growth [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=467.46s)]
*  and development to white rural populations, whose economies had been ravaged by deindustrialization. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=475.0s)]
*  So it was a way to sort of shore up support for rural white workers who had very few other [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=482.34000000000003s)]
*  employment options, especially in light of the fact that during the repression at Attica, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=487.46000000000004s)]
*  the New York state assault force that went in to suppress the rebellion also killed several [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=494.06s)]
*  of the guards, 10 guards. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=499.62s)]
*  And so, the building of prisons became a marketing tool to try to build support for prison development [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=501.48s)]
*  among rural white populations. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=507.78000000000003s)]
*  Much of this is what we're dealing with now, in terms of the—some of the demands [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=510.14000000000004s)]
*  and conversations around what's happening with the strike have to do with animosity [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=514.9s)]
*  around the recent closure of prisons that has been unfolding in New York over the past [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=519.94s)]
*  decade. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=525.0600000000001s)]
*  And you mentioned earlier solitary confinement used as a means of political repression of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=526.0600000000001s)]
*  revolutionary movements. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=532.1800000000001s)]
*  Could you talk about what your book found in terms of Attica specifically, the level [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=534.86s)]
*  of political activism that occurred in the prisons? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=540.3399999999999s)]
*  I know when I was in the Young Lords back in the 70s, we actually had members in Attica [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=543.62s)]
*  as part of the Inmates Liberation Front. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=549.66s)]
*  But the Black Panther Party, the Nation of Islam, many other political groups, Republic [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=551.54s)]
*  of New Africa, had membership and developed membership in Attica and other prisons as [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=555.78s)]
*  well. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=560.78s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=562.1s)]
*  And the Inmates Liberation Front is discussed in my book. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=563.1s)]
*  I mean, part of what I want people to understand is that prisons in the United States are best [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=565.8199999999999s)]
*  understood as institutions of low-intensity warfare that masquerade as apolitical instruments [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=570.38s)]
*  of crime control. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=576.9s)]
*  And so, part of what we see in the late 1960s is the use of prisons to repress and contain [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=578.36s)]
*  and neutralize political activism on the outside, groups like the Black Panthers and the Young [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=584.8199999999999s)]
*  Lords, as you just mentioned. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=589.98s)]
*  But in fact, what happens is that this strategy backfires, and prisons, in fact, become schools [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=592.0600000000001s)]
*  of revolutionary political education. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=597.86s)]
*  And these groups, in fact, proliferate in the prisons. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=600.4200000000001s)]
*  And that politicization interacts with the intense repression that these groups were [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=603.58s)]
*  facing, which gives rise to these different forms of rebellion that emerge all throughout [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=607.82s)]
*  the prisons. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=613.3000000000001s)]
*  Attica happened to be one of the most brutal prisons in New York State and, in fact, in [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=614.3000000000001s)]
*  the country, where many of the most political and most intellectual, most charismatic people [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=619.1s)]
*  were transferred and repressed, and it turned into a tinderbox. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=624.98s)]
*  Professor Burton, that's where the Wildcat Prison Guard strike is. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=628.3s)]
*  José Saldana, we just have 20 seconds, what you're calling for. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=631.26s)]
*  They have engaged in illegal activity, and they will continue to escalate that illegality. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=635.86s)]
*  We are building a movement to dismantle this racial brutality. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=641.9399999999999s)]
*  But in the meantime, we have to get people out of that brutal system. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=647.02s)]
*  We have legislation, elder parole, fan timings, Second Look Act. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=651.94s)]
*  These legislations will help relieve people out of these systems of brutal oppression [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=656.62s)]
*  and unite them back to their families. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=662.66s)]
*  I want to thank you both for being with us. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=664.26s)]
*  José Saldana, director of RAP, and Arsanmi Burton, author of Tip of the Spear, Black [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=666.02s)]

*  That does it for our show. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=680.3s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d71HO69KzWc&t=681.4599999999999s)]
