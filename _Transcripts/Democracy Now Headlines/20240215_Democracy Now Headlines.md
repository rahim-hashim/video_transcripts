**Democracy Now!:** [February 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3t42kBS_K0)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In Kansas City, Missouri, at least one person died and 22 were wounded during a shooting
*  at the parade celebrating Sunday's Super Bowl victory by the Kansas City Chiefs.
*  A beloved local DJ and mother named Lisa Lopez Galvan was killed in the shooting.
*  She hosted a show called Taste of Tejano on the local community radio station KKFI that
*  also airs Democracy Now! every morning.
*  The Kansas City Fire Department said eight of the shooting victims suffered, quote,
*  immediately life-threatening injuries.
*  Nine of the shooting victims were children.
*  The Kansas City schools were closed so that kids could attend the parade.
*  Police have detained three people in connection with the shooting.
*  Police are still determining a motive but have ruled out terrorism.
*  This is Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves.
*  I'm angry at what happened today.
*  The people who came to this celebration should expect a safe environment.
*  We had over 800 law enforcement officers, Kansas City and other agencies, at the location
*  to keep everyone safe.
*  Because of bad actors, which were very few, this tragedy occurred, even in the presence
*  of uniformed law enforcement officers, who again ran towards them and took them into
*  custody.
*  Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas said he and his wife had to run for safety during the
*  shooting.
*  Parades, rallies, schools, movies.
*  It seems like almost nothing is safe.
*  And we had hundreds of law enforcement there working hard today.
*  Missouri has some of the weakest gun control laws in the country, with no universal background
*  checks, no assault weapon restrictions, no ban on large-capacity magazines, no waiting
*  periods to purchase a gun and no domestic violence gun laws.
*  The shooting in Kansas City came on the sixth anniversary of the Parkland, Florida, school
*  When a 19-year-old gunman shot dead 17 people and injured 17 others at Marjory Stoneman
*  Douglas High School.
*  To mark the anniversary, gun control advocates traveled to Washington to play for lawmakers
*  a series of AI-generated audio messages featuring the voices of students killed in Parkland.
*  This is AI-generated message from Joaquin Oliver, who was shot dead at the age of 17.
*  Hello, I'm Joaquin Oliver.
*  Six years ago, I was a senior at Parkland.
*  Many students and teachers were murdered on Valentine's Day that year by a person using
*  an AR-15.
*  But you don't care.
*  You never did.
*  It's been six years and you've done nothing.
*  Not a thing to stop all the shootings that have continued to happen since.
*  The thing is, I died that day in Parkland.
*  My body was destroyed by a weapon of war.
*  I'm back today because my parents used AI to recreate my voice to call you.
*  Other victims like me will be calling, too, again and again, to demand action.
*  How many calls will it take for you to care?
*  How many dead voices will you hear before you finally listen?
*  Every day your inaction creates more voices.
*  If you fail to act now, we'll find someone who will.
*  The AI-generated audio appears on a new website called The Shotline, where the recordings
*  can be sent to lawmakers.
*  On Wednesday, Guac Oliver's parents, Manny and Patricia, were set to appear on CNN to
*  talk about the new project when news broke about the shooting in Kansas City.
*  We had an entirely different interview that we were going to do here just to talk about
*  some of the work that you guys are doing on Capitol Hill, trying to bring about awareness
*  and change.
*  And you see this happening as you were here visiting Washington.
*  What is on your mind as you're watching this?
*  I'm not surprised at all.
*  It's like literally we interrupt this interview because we have another mass shooting going
*  on, and then you might be interrupting that one because it was going to be another one.
*  So it never stops.
*  In news from Gaza, Israeli forces have bombed and raided Nasser Hospital in Chanyunis, which
*  the World Health Organization has described as the backbone of the health system in southern
*  Gaza.
*  The raid comes a day after Israel ordered thousands of displaced Palestinians and patients
*  to evacuate.
*  One doctor inside the hospital recorded an audio message from inside the hospital Wednesday.
*  And now the drone speakers, they are now saying for all doctors inside the hospital to move
*  outside the hospital.
*  Israeli soldiers and tanks surrounding the hospital from all sides, shootings and bombings
*  still continue.
*  Israel is facing growing international pressure to call off plans to launch a ground invasion
*  of Ra'aqa, where over a million displaced Palestinians have sought refuge.
*  The leaders of Canada, Australia and New Zealand have issued a joint statement calling for
*  an immediate ceasefire warning a military operation into Ra'aqa would be quote, catastrophic.
*  Palestinian UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour spoke on Wednesday at the United Nations.
*  Our effort is to do everything possible to stop Israel from committing this crime of
*  depopulating the Gaza Strip and stopping the war immediately.
*  The guarantee to do that is to have a resolution calling for a ceasefire.
*  And we hope that the Security Council would elevate itself to that responsibility.
*  In other news from Gaza, Palestinian journalist Mutaz al-Ghafari was killed on Wednesday in
*  Gaza City in an Israeli airstrike that also killed his wife and his child.
*  By one count, 125 journalists have been killed in Gaza since October 7th.
*  Ceasefire talks in Egypt have broken down after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*  reportedly blocked Israeli negotiators from returning to Cairo for follow-up talks to
*  release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.
*  In response, relatives of hostages have held protests outside the home of Netanyahu and
*  other members of Israel's war cabinet.
*  In a statement, one group of relatives said quote, this decision amounts in effect to
*  sacrificing knowingly all of the hostages' lives, unquote.
*  At least 11 people, including six children, have been killed in southern Lebanon in a
*  wave of Israeli strikes as tension along the Israeli-Lebanon border escalates.
*  Israel's attack came hours after a missile attack from Lebanon killed an Israeli soldier
*  and wounded eight others.
*  In news from Russia, at least five people have died in a suspected Ukraine air attack
*  on shopping mall in the Russian city of Belgarad.
*  18 people were reportedly injured in the attack.
*  This comes a day after Ukrainian forces blew up a Russian landing ship off the coast of
*  Crimea.
*  Australia's parliament has overwhelmingly approved a motion calling for the release
*  of imprisoned WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is an Australian citizen.
*  The vote came ahead of a critical appeal hearing before the British High Court of Justice in
*  London next week.
*  Supporters of the resolution included Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who has urged
*  the United States to drop its request to extradite Assange, who faces up to 175 years in prison
*  in the U.S. for publishing classified documents exposing U.S. war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan.
*  Assange has been held in London's infamous Belmarsh prison since 2019, awaiting possible
*  extradition to the U.S.
*  Prior to that, he spent seven years inside Ecuador's embassy in London.
*  He had political exile there.
*  Australian MP Andrew Wilkie introduced the resolution.
*  This will be the time for all of us to stand up and to take a stand.
*  And to stand with Julian Assange, stand for the principles of justice.
*  Friends, stand for the principles of media freedom and the rights of journalists to do
*  their job.
*  This has gone on too long.
*  That it must be brought to an end.
*  And I'm confident that if this parliament can support this motion this afternoon, it
*  will send a very powerful political signal to the British government and to the U.S.
*  government.
*  To see the two Belmarsh tribunals that were held at the National Pless Club last year,
*  you can go to democracynow.org.
*  In news from California, the Bay Area Air Quality Management Agency says it's won
*  a decisive victory in a years-long legal battle against two oil refineries in the East Bay.
*  In a pair of settlements, Chevron and the Martinez Refining Company have agreed to
*  cut emissions and pay up to $138 million in penalties and fines for violating agency rules
*  regulating airborne particulate matter.
*  In labor news, thousands of Uber and Lyft drivers took part in a strike Wednesday demanding
*  better pay and working conditions.
*  And what organizers say was the largest rideshare strike in U.S. history.
*  Delivery workers from DoorDash also took part.
*  The Valentine's Day strike came on the same day Uber's stock price jumped to a new high
*  after the company announced it would buy back up to $7 billion worth of company shares in
*  a move that will benefit shareholders.
*  In other labor news, flight attendants picketed at 30 airports Tuesday in a national day of
*  action demanding higher wages and a new contract.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
