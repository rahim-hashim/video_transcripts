# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” October 2, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXVIjinF6G8)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, Democracy Now!
*  The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to retaliate after Iran fired at
*  least 180 ballistic missiles at Israel in response to repeated Israeli attacks on Lebanon
*  and the assassination of several Hezbollah leaders, including Hassan Nasrallah.
*  Video posted online shows some of the missiles striking at or near the Nevatim airbase, which
*  houses Israel's U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets.
*  Israel says the only death from the attacks was a Palestinian man who was killed by falling
*  debris in the occupied West Bank in Jericho.
*  At the White House, President Biden responded by saying the United States will help Israel
*  quote, exact, severe consequences, unquote.
*  On Tuesday, a Pentagon spokesperson said U.S. forces had aided Israel in thwarting Iran's
*  attack.
*  During the attack, the U.S. military coordinated closely with the Israeli defense forces to
*  help defend Israel.
*  U.S. Navy destroyers deployed to the Middle East region supported the defense of Israel
*  by firing approximately a dozen interceptors against the incoming Iranian missiles.
*  In Tel Aviv, Israeli police said at least seven people died in a shooting and stabbing
*  attack on Tuesday.
*  Israeli authorities claim the attack was carried out by two people from the occupied West Bank.
*  One was shot dead, the other seriously wounded.
*  In Lebanon, Hezbollah says its fighters have repelled incursions by Israeli forces attempting
*  to invade southern Lebanon.
*  Israeli media reports at least two Israeli soldiers were killed, 18 others wounded near
*  the Lebanese border town of Odessa.
*  Meanwhile, Israel's military ordered more residents of Beirut's southern suburbs to
*  evacuate their homes.
*  The U.N. says more than a million people across Lebanon have been uprooted by Israel's assault.
*  In the Gaza Strip, Palestinian health officials say Israeli attacks have killed more than
*  79 Palestinians, wounding 82 others over the past 24 hours.
*  In one strike, Israeli fighter jets bombed a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City's Tufakh
*  neighborhood, killing at least 13 people, including children.
*  Israeli forces also bombed the Al Amal orphanage west of Gaza City, killing six Palestinians
*  and wounding many others.
*  Here in New York, vice presidential nominees Tim Walz and JD Vance faced off in their first
*  and only debate ahead of November's election.
*  The two clashed when Walz questioned Vance about Trump's claims that the 2020 election
*  was stolen.
*  Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris's record on border security while Walz condemned
*  Donald Trump over abortion rights.
*  Their sparring over abortion came as a new law took effect in Louisiana that reclassifies
*  the abortion medications methotpristone and misoprostol, listing them as controlled dangerous
*  substances.
*  The first of its kind law in the country makes it a crime punishable by up to five years
*  in prison to possess the medications without a prescription.
*  In Ukraine, authorities have declared a day of mourning in the southern city of Kherson,
*  where a Russian attack on a market killed six people and wounded more than 10 others.
*  Elsewhere, at least one person was killed and 32 injured when Russia bombed residential
*  buildings and infrastructure in the southern Zaporizhzhia region.
*  In eastern Ukraine, Russian forces have taken control of the city of Volodar, along with
*  two more frontline villages.
*  Meanwhile, Ukraine's top prosecutor says he's investigating the murder of 16 Ukrainian
*  prisoners of war, alleging they were summarily executed after they were surrendered to Russian
*  forces on the Eastern Front.
*  In Brussels, Belgium, the former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was sworn in as secretary
*  general of NATO Tuesday.
*  In his inaugural speech, he pledged to shore up Western support of Ukraine and warned China
*  over its growing ties with Russia.
*  Through its support for Russia's military industry, China has become a decisive enabler
*  of Russia's war in Ukraine.
*  China cannot continue to fuel the largest conflict in Europe since the Second World
*  War without this impacting its interests and reputation.
*  The White House has approved an additional $567 million in U.S. military aid to Taiwan,
*  the largest such aid package ever.
*  Its approval came as Chinese authorities led celebrations marking the 75th anniversary
*  of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
*  Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke from Beijing.
*  XI JINPING, Chinese Leader, People's Republic of China
*  Taiwan is a sacred territory of China, and the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
*  are connected by blood, which is thicker than water.
*  President Xi warned against separatist activities, as he put it in Taiwan, and said its reunification
*  with China is inevitable.
*  Claudia Sheinbaum was sworn in as Mexico's first female president Tuesday, pledging her
*  six-year term will be a time for transformation.
*  Sheinbaum has vowed to strengthen women's rights in Mexico, which is one of the highest
*  rates of femicide, to expand access to public health care and education and other social
*  reforms that have been bolstered by the ruling Morena Party.
*  Sheinbaum received the baton of power from indigenous and Afro-Mexican women, who joined
*  her onstage as she addressed thousands of supporters gathered in Mexico City's Zocalo
*  Square.
*  I am certain that power is honesty and humility, that our thinking is Mexican humanism, that
*  our nation and people are great.
*  And I am certain we are the only option that represents well-being and progress with justice.
*  Here in the United States, the death toll from Hurricane Helene has surpassed 166 people
*  across six states, with hundreds still missing more than five days after the storm triggered
*  devastating floods and landslides.
*  Massive power outages continue to impact over 1.3 million customers.
*  In eastern Tennessee, at least six plastic factory workers are missing and presumed dead
*  after floodwaters swelled around their workplace, trapping the group of predominantly Latinx
*  workers who for hours clung to the back of a semi-truck before they were swept away by
*  the deluge.
*  Some family members report the employer, Impact Plastics, told the workers not to evacuate
*  and threatened to fire anyone who left ahead of the storm.
*  This is Robert Jarvis, one of the survivors.
*  What would you say to the company?
*  Why did you make us work that day?
*  Why?
*  We shouldn't have worked.
*  We shouldn't have been there.
*  None of us should have been there.
*  And that's what I too would say to them.
*  Hurricane Helene has become the second deadliest hurricane after Katrina.
*  The state of Texas has put another prisoner to death.
*  On Tuesday, 61-year-old Garcia Glenn White was strapped to a gurney in the state penitentiary
*  in Huntsville and injected with a single lethal dose of the drug pentobarbital.
*  It was the sixth execution carried out in the United States in the last 11 days.
*  An investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice has found violence and sexual assault
*  are rife in prisons across Georgia, constituting cruel and unusual punishment for the state's
*  estimated 50,000 incarcerated people.
*  The scathing report by the DOJ Civil Rights Division found Georgia fails to protect people
*  in custody from extreme violence inside 34 state prisons, as well as four prisons run
*  by for-profit corporate contractors.
*  It also found an unconstitutional risk of harm from sexual violence at these prisons,
*  including widespread sexual assaults of LGBTQ-plus people.
*  Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke leads the Justice Department Civil Rights
*  Division.
*  In America, time in prison should not be a sentence to death, torture or rape.
*  We can't turn a blind eye to the wretched conditions and wanton violence unfolding in
*  these institutions.
*  The people incarcerated in these jails and prisons are our neighbors, siblings, children,
*  parents, family members and friends.
*  The Justice Department has announced a federal investigation in the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre
*  after Oklahoma's Supreme Court in June dismissed a lawsuit brought by two elderly survivors.
*  No one's ever been charged over the murders of an estimated 300 black people who were
*  killed when a white mob burned down what was known as Black Wall Street, the thriving African-American
*  neighborhood of Greenwood.
*  The Justice Department will probe the killings under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights
*  Crime Act, which gives the federal government the power to reopen civil rights-related cold
*  cases.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
