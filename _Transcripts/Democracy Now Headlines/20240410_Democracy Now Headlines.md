# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” April 10, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8ENB42okvM)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In an historic ruling, Arizona's conservative Supreme Court has reinstated an 1864 law barring
*  almost all abortions in the state.
*  In its ruling, the court wrote, quote, "'Physicians are now on notice that all abortions, except
*  those necessary to save a woman's life, are illegal,'' unquote.
*  The 160-year-old law predates Arizona becoming a state and was passed decades before women
*  could even vote.
*  While the court stayed its decision for 14 days, the ruling sent shockwaves across Arizona
*  and the nation.
*  President Biden slammed the ruling as extreme and dangerous.
*  Arizona's Attorney General Chris Mays said she will not enforce it, saying, quote, "'No
*  woman or doctor will be prosecuted under the Strickconian law.'"
*  Arizona's Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs vowed to protect abortion rights.
*  Arizona's 2022 abortion ban is extreme and hurts women.
*  And the near-total Civil War-era ban that continues to hang over our heads only serves
*  to create more chaos for women and doctors in our state.
*  As governor, I promised I would do everything in my power to protect our reproductive freedoms.
*  Last week, the group Arizona for Abortion Access said it had collected enough signatures,
*  over half a million, to put a measure on the ballot in November to enshrine abortion rights
*  in Arizona.
*  Reproductive rights will also play a key role in Arizona's closely watched Senate race.
*  Republican candidate Carrie Lake criticized the court's ruling Tuesday, even though
*  just two years ago she called it a, quote, "'great law.'"
*  The Arizona ruling came just a day after Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump said
*  abortion should be decided by the states.
*  We'll have more on Arizona after headlines.
*  President Biden's leveled some of his harshest criticism of Israel yet, as the death toll
*  in Gaza tops 33,300.
*  In an interview with Univision, Biden directly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*  Netanyahu and Israel's killing of seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen last week.
*  Biden's comments were made a week ago, but only aired on Univision on Tuesday.
*  Palestinians in Gaza are making the end of Ramadan as Israel continues its assault.
*  Officials in Gaza say at least 14 Palestinians, including four children, have died in Israeli
*  strikes on the Nusrat refugee camp.
*  On Monday, Israel assassinated the mayor of the Al-Maghazi refugee camp.
*  Hamas accused Israel of committing a war crime.
*  The Israeli Occupation's Army committed a crime yesterday with the assassination of
*  Al-Maghazi municipal chief Hatem Salah al-Ghomri.
*  He's known as a civilian, a municipal head, who provides municipal services since the
*  first day of this war, this genocide against civilians in civil sectors.
*  The Israeli Occupation's Army purposefully targeted al-Ghomri, even though they are fully
*  aware that he's a civil servant and only works within that framework at Al-Maghazi
*  refugee camp.
*  On Capitol Hill, about 50 protesters were arrested Tuesday when they blocked access
*  to the Senate cafeteria, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
*  Also, the protesters also disrupted Lloyd Austin during a Senate hearing, where the
*  defense secretary was questioned by Republican Senator Tom Carton of Arkansas.
*  I want to address what the protesters raised earlier.
*  Is Israel committing genocide in Gaza?
*  Senator Carton, we don't have any evidence of genocide being created.
*  So that's a no.
*  Israel is not committing genocide in Gaza.
*  We don't have evidence of that to my knowledge, yeah.
*  That was Lloyd Austin speaking with Arkansas's Republican Senator Tom Carton.
*  Turkey's announced it will restrict exports to Israel until Israel declares a ceasefire
*  in Gaza and allows in more aid.
*  Israel blasted Turkey's decision, accusing it of blackmail.
*  The first criminal trial of a former U.S. president appears set to begin Monday, after
*  Donald Trump lost his tenth attempt to delay the trial.
*  But Trump's appeal could still be heard by a full panel of five appellate court judges.
*  Trump's accused of falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to adult film
*  star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.
*  In 2018, Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to making the payments for
*  Trump and spent over a year in prison.
*  The state of Missouri executed Brian Dorsey Tuesday despite a rare call by 70 prison guards
*  and a former warden for his life to be spared.
*  Dorsey was convicted in 2006 for murdering his cousin and her husband while high on drugs.
*  He later turned himself in and pleaded guilty.
*  Prison guards at the Potosi Correctional Center recently wrote to Missouri Governor Mike Parson,
*  urging him to commute Dorsey's death sentence.
*  They cited his unblemished record in prison, during which time he became a popular barber
*  who cut the hair of both prisoners and staff.
*  The guards wrote, quote, "'He doesn't deserve to be executed.
*  We know that he was convicted of murder, but that is not the Brian Dorsey that we know,'
*  unquote.
*  In Michigan, the parents of Ethan Crumbly, who shot dead four classmates at Oxford High
*  School in 2021, have been sentenced to between 10 and 15 years in prison.
*  James and Jennifer Crumbly are the first parents to be held criminally responsible for a mass
*  school shooting committed by their child.
*  During the sentencing hearing, Nicole Bocelet, the mother of Madison Baldwin, who died in
*  the school shooting, addressed the Crumblies.
*  You say you wouldn't do anything different.
*  Well, that really says on what type of parents you are, because there's a lot of things
*  I would do different.
*  But the one thing I would have wanted to be different was to take that bullet that day
*  so she could continue to live the life she deserved.
*  New York City's reached a $28 million settlement in a lawsuit brought forward by the family
*  of a former Rikers prisoner who suffered severe bullet wounds.
*  The family of the former Rikers prisoner was arrested on charges of attempted murder
*  and attempted murder.

*  Newly released body cam video shows plainclothes Chicago police officers fired nearly 100 shots
*  in just 41 seconds.
*  It remains unclear why officers assigned to a tactical unit pulled over Reed, who was
*  black, or why they approached his car with guns drawn.

*  Police claimed the shoot-out began after Reed fired the first shot.
*  And the railroad giant Norfolk Southern has agreed to pay $600 million to settle a class
*  action lawsuit over last year's train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.
*  The disaster led to a massive explosion and the release of toxic chemicals,
*  including levels of dioxin hundreds of times higher than what's considered safe.
*  Many local residents say they fear the settlement will not come close to covering future health
*  care expenses.
*  East Palestine resident Chrissy Ferguson criticized the settlement, saying, quote,
*  I just feel like we've been victimized over and over and over again.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
