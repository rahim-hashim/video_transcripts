On Monday, Israeli strikes killed two Palestinian journalists: Al Jazeera's Hossam Shabat, who was 23 years old, and Palestine Today's Mohammed Mansour, who was killed in his apartment alongside his wife. This brings the total number of journalists that Israel has killed in Gaza over the past year and a half to 206. Just before his death, Shabat had shared news of Mansour's killing on social media and filed an article with _Drop Site News_ describing Israel's scorched-earth campaign in his hometown of Beit Hanoun. His editor Sharif Abdel Kouddous remembers Shabat as a "warm and funny person," dedicated to his job and his community. In recent months, he had been under increasing surveillance by the Israeli military, which labeled him a terrorist and placed him on a "hit list." Despite being "targeted and openly hunted," Shabat "continued nevertheless to cover the genocide of his people."

*  The report reports Israel is considering a major ground invasion of Gaza to reoccupy [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=29.64s)]
*  the entire territory. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=35.86s)]
*  The death toll in Gaza has now surpassed 50,000, and it's actually expected to be much higher. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=38.980000000000004s)]
*  On Monday, Israeli strikes killed two Palestinian journalists, Mohammed Mansour and Hussam Shabab. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=47.72s)]

*  in Gaza since October 2023. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  Mohammed Mansour worked for the Beirut-based Palestine Today TV. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=64.68s)]
*  He was killed in an Israeli airstrike on his home in Chanyounis. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  Soon after, Hussam Shabab was killed in an Israeli airstrike on his car in Bethlehia. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=75.36s)]
*  Shabab worked for Al Jazeera and also wrote for the online news site Dropsite. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=82.48s)]
*  In October, the Israeli military placed him and five other Palestinian journalists on [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=88.04s)]
*  a hit list. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=92.92s)]
*  Hours before his death, he filed his last article for Dropsite. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=94.2s)]
*  In the piece, he describes the resumption of Israel's scorched-earth campaign on his [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=98.84s)]
*  hometown of Beth-Hanoun. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=103.56s)]
*  In a moment, we'll be joined by Hussam Shabab's editor at Dropsite, Sharif Abdel-Khadoos. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  But first, let's hear Hussam in his own words. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=112.2s)]
*  — Are you not afraid for your life? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=115.4s)]
*  — As long as there are massacres and bombings, should we stop? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=119.48s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=122.8s)]
*  — So, despite the massacres, you keep going? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=123.8s)]
*  — There are massacres and bombings, so we must continue covering and spreading the truth. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=128.68s)]
*  The Israeli occupation is determined to chase down journalists, to prevent the exposure [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=134.88s)]
*  of their crimes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=138.76s)]
*  Yesterday, the horrors of the massacre hurt everyone and also disturbed the Israeli occupying [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=141.32s)]
*  forces. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=145.68s)]
*  That's why they issued threats against Enes El-Sharif and several other journalists. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=146.68s)]
*  But the coverage will continue, God willing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=151.64s)]
*  — Those were the words of 23-year-old Palestinian journalist Hussam Shabat, who was killed in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=155.12s)]
*  an Israeli airstrike on Monday. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  After his death, Shabat's friends posted a message he'd written. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  It began, quote, "'If you're reading this, it means I've been killed. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=166.16s)]
*  I was likely targeted by the Israeli occupation forces. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=171.0s)]
*  For the past 18 months, I've dedicated every moment of my life to my people. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=174.0s)]
*  I documented the horrors in northern Gaza minute by minute, determined to show the world [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  the truth they tried to bury. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=183.8s)]
*  I slept on pavements and schools and tents anywhere I could. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  Each day was a battle for survival. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=191.24s)]
*  I endured hunger for months, yet I never left my people's side." [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=193.36s)]
*  The words of Palestinian journalist Hussam Shabat. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=198.12s)]
*  We're joined right now by Sharif Abdel-Kaduz, the award-winning journalist and editor at [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=200.68s)]
*  Dropsite News, who are closely with Hussam Shabat, editing and translating his articles [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=205.36s)]
*  into English. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=212.08s)]
*  Sharif just won an RTS Television Journalism Award and an Overseas Press Club Award for [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=213.44s)]
*  his Al Jazeera Fault Lines documentary, The Night Won't End. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=222.0s)]
*  And we're going to talk about that in a moment, but first to your colleague, Hussam. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=226.32s)]
*  Tell us about him, Sharif. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=230.72s)]
*  A tremendous loss. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=232.68s)]
*  Hussam was an incredible journalist, 23 years old, from Beit Hanun, who was one of the very [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=235.32s)]
*  few journalists who remained in the north throughout Israel's 17-month genocidal assault. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=244.52s)]
*  His ability to cover one of the most brutal military campaigns in recent history was almost [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=254.28s)]
*  beyond comprehension. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=260.44s)]
*  He was witness to untold suffering and death almost every single day. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=262.36s)]
*  He was often hungry, didn't have enough food. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=268.34s)]
*  He told me he was displaced 20 times. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  He didn't have anywhere to sleep. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=274.68s)]
*  He was exhausted. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=276.88s)]
*  And he buried many friends and many of his journalist colleagues over this time. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=279.24s)]
*  He himself was wounded in an Israeli airstrike. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=284.84s)]
*  Despite all of this, he somehow managed to continue reporting relentlessly every single [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=287.64s)]
*  day. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  And as you mentioned, he was one of two journalists that was killed yesterday. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=294.36s)]
*  Mohammed Mansoor of Palestine today was killed. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=298.0s)]
*  Hussam's last social media post on his Instagram feed was a photo of the dead body of Mohammed [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=300.52s)]
*  saying that another journalist has been martyred. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=308.26s)]
*  Barely an hour later, Hussam is driving in his car in Beit Lahya, and the Israeli military [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=311.22s)]
*  bombed his car. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=318.02s)]
*  There's footage of his body lying prone on the ground, bloodied, and he was killed. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=319.02s)]
*  And I think we have to be very clear, Hussam was deliberately killed. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=324.22s)]
*  He was assassinated by the Israeli military. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=327.98s)]
*  The Israeli military has openly admitted to this. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=330.9s)]
*  They call him a terrorist, and they said, quote, don't let the press vest fool you. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=334.78s)]
*  OK? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=340.29999999999995s)]
*  This is what it's come to. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=341.46s)]
*  And Israel has a long history of killing journalists, especially Palestinian journalists, with impunity. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=342.46s)]
*  But often what we've seen in the past is either they deny that they're responsible for killing [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=349.41999999999996s)]
*  them, or they'll say there was some sort of collateral damage, they didn't mean it, or [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=353.46s)]
*  that the journalist, what we started to see was the journalist was a terrorist and a militant [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=360.38s)]
*  after the fact. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=365.94s)]
*  But what was different this time is that Hussam and five other journalists in October were [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=367.54s)]
*  placed on essentially a hit list by the Israeli military, calling them militants, calling [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=373.28s)]
*  them terrorists, and saying they were going to kill them, basically. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  Hussam at the time said that he felt like he was being hunted. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=382.3s)]
*  And this is, you know, part of a broad— [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=386.7s)]
*  He was getting calls. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=389.5s)]
*  And the spokesperson in Arabic for the Israeli military is calling him out by name, calling [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=390.5s)]
*  out Enes Shalif and other journalists, saying that we're going to get you. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=396.22s)]
*  And so, this is kind of new, like preemptively and openly targeting them. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=401.98s)]
*  And I think it's shameful, shameful that this is being met with something akin to silence [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=408.46000000000004s)]
*  by Western media institutions. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=412.98s)]
*  These are our colleagues that are being killed, they're being targeted and openly hunted [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=415.42s)]
*  by the Israeli military. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=419.46000000000004s)]
*  You know, and this silence was something Hussam was angry about as well. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=422.42s)]
*  When five journalists were killed in an Israeli airstrike in December, I messaged Hussam, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=426.46000000000004s)]
*  and just to check in on him, and he responded, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=433.78000000000003s)]
*  Our job is only to die. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=436.86s)]
*  I hate this world. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=438.94s)]
*  No one is doing anything. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=440.62s)]
*  I swear I've come to hate this job. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=442.18s)]
*  And he knew himself that he was most likely going to be killed, because he was being hunted [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=444.5s)]
*  in this way. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=450.06s)]
*  He continued, nevertheless, to cover the genocide of his people. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=451.06s)]
*  And as you mentioned, you know, this is a 23-year-old who wrote a letter knowing that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=456.22s)]
*  it would be published after his death that opened with, if you're reading this, it [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=461.82s)]
*  means I have been killed, most likely deliberately targeted by the Israeli occupation forces. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=465.86s)]
*  And it ends with these words, and I think they're important. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=469.66s)]
*  I ask you now, do not stop speaking about Gaza. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=472.42s)]
*  Do not let the world look away. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=476.46000000000004s)]
*  Keep fighting. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=478.6s)]
*  Keep telling our stories until Palestine is free. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=479.8s)]
*  And it's left to all of us to do just that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=482.74s)]
*  We'll not forget Hussam. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=485.1s)]
*  We will not let the world look away. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=486.1s)]
*  I mean, Sharif, you did the award-winning Al Jazeera documentary, The Killing of Shreen [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=487.58000000000004s)]
*  Abu Akhla. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=493.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, she was Palestinian-American. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=494.5s)]
*  What kind of response—and, of course, the U.S.'s funding and arming the Israeli military—came [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=498.02s)]
*  out of the very direct, we saw her killed, you analyzed with forensic architecture exactly [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=505.65999999999997s)]
*  what happened to her with an Israeli sniper killing her, the well-known face of Al Jazeera [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=512.66s)]
*  Arabic, May 11, 2022. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=517.62s)]
*  You even have the Senator Van Hollen demanding the investigation be public. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=522.2s)]
*  But— [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=526.96s)]
*  But, I mean, the U.S. essentially adopted the Israeli narrative of what happened, which [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=527.96s)]
*  only came after a lot of pressure. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=533.44s)]
*  They initially denied that they killed Shreen Abu Akhla, blaming it on a Palestinian militant, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=534.84s)]
*  which was an easily-debunked claim. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  And then they finally admitted, under a lot of pressure, that she—they did probably [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=540.2800000000001s)]
*  kill her, but that she was caught in crossfire, although that claim was directly contradicted [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=544.1600000000001s)]
*  video footage and eyewitness testimony. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=548.84s)]
*  But the U.S. essentially adopted that narrative. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=551.92s)]
*  I mean, it shouldn't matter that she had American citizenship, but that makes the U.S. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=553.8399999999999s)]
*  responsible for her. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=559.56s)]
*  And even then—for example, President Biden refused to meet with the families of Shreen [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=560.68s)]
*  Abu Akhla. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=565.88s)]
*  I mean, he met with the family of Austin Tice. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=566.88s)]
*  He met with the family of Evan Gershkovich, other U.S. journalists who either had been [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=570.0s)]
*  disappeared or were in prison, but he refused to meet with the family of an American journalist [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=574.8399999999999s)]
*  who was killed. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=580.56s)]
*  But to go back to Hussein, I don't know. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=582.16s)]
*  I think that—he was messaging me literally hours before this happened. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=587.1999999999999s)]
*  He was always eager to kind of get the story out. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=592.4s)]
*  We had agreed that he would write the story about witnessing the resumption of Israel's [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=595.3199999999999s)]
*  scorched earth campaign in Beit Hanun, where he's from. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=600.36s)]
*  He returned there, like so many people, after the so-called ceasefire, where, you know, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=603.86s)]
*  upwards of half a million people returned to the north, where Hussein was, but he was [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=610.5s)]
*  able to go to Beit Hanun. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=614.58s)]
*  And he was there when, exactly a week ago, Israel conducted one of the most brutal and [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=615.82s)]
*  vicious aerial bombardments of the 17-months genocidal assault, killing, I think, over [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=622.82s)]
*  200 children in a matter of hours, 200 children in a matter of hours. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=631.62s)]
*  And Hussein's article was about what he witnessed that day. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=635.94s)]
*  And I'll read to you what I translated yesterday, that I translated through tears, because he [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=639.7s)]
*  had just been killed. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=645.6600000000001s)]
*  He said he ends it with saying, There's no justification for this. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=647.26s)]
*  Everything is being crushed. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=652.12s)]
*  The lives of innocent people, their dignity and their hopes for a better future. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=653.5400000000001s)]
*  I wanted to cite what our colleague Jeremy Scahill of DropSite News posted, this video [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=658.7s)]
*  on social media with the words, This is Who Israel Murdered Today, our colleague, Hassan [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=666.22s)]
*  Shabat. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=671.42s)]
*  In the video, a child greets Hassan in his car and tells him she was scared he'd been [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=672.42s)]
*  killed and that he's her inspiration to become a journalist in the future. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=678.0600000000001s)]
*  I swear, I missed you. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=684.0600000000001s)]
*  They said you were martyred. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=686.78s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=687.78s)]
*  What do you mean why? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=688.78s)]
*  When the occupation entered the north? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=689.78s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=690.78s)]
*  We were about to mourn you, man. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=691.78s)]
*  I swear. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=693.14s)]
*  Was it bad? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=694.14s)]
*  We missed you. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=695.14s)]
*  What do you believe in? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=696.14s)]
*  That there's no God but Allah? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=697.14s)]
*  I swear to God that I came down to see you. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=699.02s)]
*  So you missed us. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=701.54s)]
*  I swear by Almighty God that I came down to see you. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=702.54s)]
*  You're a real champ. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=704.94s)]
*  What do you want to be when you grow up? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=705.94s)]
*  I swear I missed you all. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=707.74s)]
*  Why martyred then? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=709.58s)]
*  A journalist. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=710.58s)]
*  And I was thinking, How am I supposed to become a journalist if Hassan Shabat were martyred? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=711.58s)]
*  We'll make you a journalist, God willing. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=715.34s)]
*  How am I supposed to become a journalist then? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=717.06s)]
*  You want to become a journalist? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=718.7s)]
*  God willing, you'll become one. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=720.14s)]
*  I want to become a journalist. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=722.38s)]
*  How can I become a journalist? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=724.02s)]
*  I mean, he's such a warm and funny person also in our frequent messages and voice notes [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=725.62s)]
*  with each other. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=730.7s)]
*  Despite all the death and violence around him, he somehow still managed to be warm. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=732.9399999999999s)]
*  And I think it was this kind of rebellion against everything that was happening around [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=738.7s)]
*  him to maintain this attitude. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=742.06s)]
*  And like I said, you know, he's one of over 200 journalists that have been killed. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=745.38s)]
*  This is an unprecedented rate of killing of journalists. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=748.1400000000001s)]
*  And the journalists that are alive, I mean, so another drop-site contributor, Abu Bakr [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=751.3000000000001s)]
*  Abed, who's been on Democracy Now! [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=754.82s)]
*  many times, let's remember Israel has imposed a complete siege on Gaza since March 2nd. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=756.2600000000001s)]
*  So this is over three weeks, not a single truck of food, medicine, fuel. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=762.5400000000001s)]
*  Even before the bombing, they imposed this siege. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=768.6600000000001s)]
*  This is a reimposed forced starvation that is happening. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=772.1s)]
*  Abu Bakr is 22 years old. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=775.1s)]
*  He's suffering from malnutrition. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=777.58s)]
*  He just messaged me the other day. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=779.46s)]
*  He said he's completely worn out. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=781.82s)]
*  He can't get out of bed. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=783.58s)]
*  He's in pain. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=784.62s)]
*  His body aches. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=785.62s)]
*  He needs galvanized multivitamins and other medicines. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=786.74s)]
*  We're trying to get it to him. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=790.62s)]
*  I'm speaking to doctors that we know in Gaza. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=792.02s)]
*  They said there's no supplies. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=795.08s)]
*  They can't get anything to him. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=796.4200000000001s)]
*  Another journalist who also writes for Dropsite, Rasha Abu Jalal, she almost died last week [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=799.9s)]
*  when the Israeli military bombed. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=803.7399999999999s)]
*  She's in Gaza City, one of the many people who returned to the north. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=805.7399999999999s)]
*  They bombed the house right next to her. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=810.14s)]
*  The wall collapsed on the room where she usually sleeps with her husband and five children. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=812.14s)]
*  They just happened to be sleeping in the room next door because it was warmer. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=816.5s)]
*  And they managed to survive miraculously, although 11 people were killed, their neighbors, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=821.26s)]
*  including an 8-year-old girl. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=827.06s)]
*  I want to go to Abba Barkha Abed, speaking on Democracy Now! just in the last few weeks. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=828.6999999999999s)]
*  People have not yet recovered from the English trauma they have been through during the past [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=834.9399999999999s)]
*  15 months. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=841.26s)]
*  We haven't taken a breath from what we have been enduring. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=842.26s)]
*  And it just happened all out of a sudden. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=845.38s)]
*  We were harshly awakened. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=848.02s)]
*  We couldn't really understand what was happening. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=849.26s)]
*  I'm talking to you, and I'm literally shaking. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=851.86s)]
*  People have to understand that the people of Gaza cannot really go into any more seconds [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=854.46s)]
*  of this war. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=859.78s)]
*  This is just indiscriminate, unbearable, insurmountable, inconceivable. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=860.78s)]
*  I don't know what more words I can tell you to describe the scenes at the moment. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=864.78s)]
*  People don't know. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=869.3000000000001s)]
*  We have right now overpriced hanging, scarcity of food items. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=870.3000000000001s)]
*  People don't know. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=874.62s)]
*  People have spent their days, the past 24 hours, without a single meal at all. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=875.9s)]
*  I know families have been took to the family. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=881.3000000000001s)]
*  For me personally, I just had some bread along with some cheese. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=883.2199999999999s)]
*  The prices are insane. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=886.66s)]
*  Everything is going right now is absolutely insane. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=888.4599999999999s)]
*  It's just about like you're hearing your neighbors screaming in pain. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=892.14s)]
*  That kind of screams and that kind of several bombings that have happened over time has [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=898.9s)]
*  just revoked a lot of painful memories that I've been through and that I've had during [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=906.18s)]
*  the past 15 months. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=912.18s)]
*  That's Abubakar Abed speaking on Democracy Now!, 22 years old, and when we show him on [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=913.66s)]
*  video or showing him on video now, he's getting skinnier and skinnier. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=921.02s)]
*  I was with you, Sandej Sharif, when you were getting those texts where he said his whole [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=924.9399999999999s)]
*  body is aching. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=928.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he's suffering the way millions of Palestinians in Gaza are suffering because [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=930.5799999999999s)]
*  of the siege. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=937.02s)]
*  The Ministry of Health just put out, by the way, a report that's over a thousand pages [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=938.86s)]
*  with the names and ages and ID numbers of over 50,000 Palestinians that have been confirmed [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=944.54s)]
*  that these are just the ones that have passed through public hospitals, 50,000 Palestinians. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=950.86s)]
*  There's 400 pages that are just the names of children. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=956.9399999999999s)]
*  The first 27 pages, the age is listed as zero because those are children and babies under [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=960.18s)]
*  the age of one who were killed. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=966.64s)]
*  Sharif, you and your Al Jazeera team just won two major documentary awards, RTS, that's [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=969.16s)]
*  Royal Television Society, you picked up this award in London, and then the Overseas Press [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=977.16s)]
*  Club Award, much coveted award. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=982.5s)]
*  For your documentary, Andraza, the night won't end. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=985.32s)]
*  And if you can tell us where your title came from and also the fact and what you talked [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=988.88s)]
*  about when you came on Democracy Now!, the level which you depended on Palestinian journalists [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=993.8000000000001s)]
*  in Gaza to bring us the images of what is happening there. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1000.24s)]
*  Let's remember Israel forbids Western journalists from entering Gaza. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1004.16s)]
*  Yeah, these awards are a testament to the journalists in Gaza who really made this documentary. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1008.48s)]
*  They're the ones who filmed everything in Gaza. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1014.9200000000001s)]
*  They did the interviews. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1018.36s)]
*  The Overseas Press Club Award actually cites the cinematic shots of the documentary. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1020.84s)]
*  So this is an award that's a testament to them. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1028.12s)]
*  I need to say something about the Royal Television Society Awards, though. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1029.68s)]
*  At the award ceremony in London earlier this month, they were supposed to present a special [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1034.12s)]
*  award honoring Palestinian journalists in Gaza that was rescinded at the last minute. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1037.72s)]
*  I didn't know this at the time, because it said they didn't want to add fuel to the [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1042.4s)]
*  surrounding a BBC documentary that was titled Gaza, How to Survive a War Zone, because the [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1047.16s)]
*  child narrator's father was once a Hamas minister. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1052.24s)]
*  So instead of calling out the BBC... [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1056.8000000000002s)]
*  The BBC revoked that. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1058.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, pulled the documentary. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1060.4s)]
*  And instead of calling out the BBC for doing this under pressure, a documentary about children [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1061.5600000000002s)]
*  surviving a genocide and narrating it, the RTS pulled the award honoring Palestinian [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1066.0400000000002s)]
*  journalists because it was, quote, a political football. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1071.64s)]
*  But this caused outrage, and over 400 journalists and media workers signed a letter opposing [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1074.8799999999999s)]
*  this. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1080.24s)]
*  And actually, they will be reinstating that award today in London for Palestinian journalists [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1081.24s)]
*  who deserve, you know, all of our support. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1086.24s)]
*  And we have to fight for justice for them, because they're being killed at an unprecedented [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1088.96s)]
*  rate. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1092.4s)]
*  I want to thank you so much, Sharif, for all of your work in bringing out the voices and [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1094.4s)]
*  reports of people in Gaza. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1099.24s)]
*  Sharif Abdel-Kadous, award-winning journalist, editor at Dropsite News, correspondent on [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCCyawksdE&t=1101.2s)]
