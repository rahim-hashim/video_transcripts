We speak with NDN Collective founder and CEO Nick Tilsen, who was with Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier as he was released from a federal prison in Florida Monday after nearly half a century behind bars, and returned home with him to North Dakota. Peltier has always maintained his innocence for the 1975 killing of two FBI officers, and many activists have noted inconsistencies in his trial. In the final days of his presidency, former President Joe Biden granted Peltier clemency, commuting his life sentence. Peltier will remain on house arrest in the Turtle Mountain community in North Dakota. "Today I am finally free! They may have imprisoned me but they never took my spirit!" Peltier told supporters once he was released. "Thank you to all my supporters throughout the world who fought for my freedom." Tilsen said it was "absolute pure joy" seeing him out of prison. "The release of Leonard Peltier is something that touches all of us, because all of us see a little bit of ourselves in Leonard Peltier."

*  As it is right now, we've been united all through indigenous countries, and we're going [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=89.04s)]
*  to fight back. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=97.04s)]
*  We're going to continue until we are a free nation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=98.04s)]
*  I gave 50 years for that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=102.04s)]
*  I'm going to give the rest of my life. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=105.04s)]
*  They haven't broken me. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=108.04s)]
*  They have not broken me. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=109.04s)]
*  I am not broken. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=110.04s)]
*  After Leonard Peltier was released from the Coleman prison in Florida, he flew back to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=111.04s)]
*  North Dakota, where he'll live on the tribal homelands of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=118.04s)]
*  Indians. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=124.04s)]
*  Supporters greeted him as he landed in North Dakota. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=125.04s)]
*  Supporters of Leonard Peltier also gathered in Florida Tuesday morning to greet him after [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=138.04s)]
*  his release. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=144.04s)]
*  This is tracker Gina Marie Rangel-Kinone. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=145.04s)]
*  So, our relative Leonard Peltier has been incarcerated for 50 years in a draconian system. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=147.04s)]
*  And I am from Arizona. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=156.04s)]
*  We are First Nation people, and we are here to witness this as our relative walks out. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=157.04s)]
*  This is the most important day, because not only does it stand for the indigenous First [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=162.04s)]
*  Nation people here on Turtle Island, but it also stands for people internationally. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=167.04s)]
*  This represents—his incarceration represented not only other political prisoners, but people [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=173.04s)]
*  who stand for insolidarity for all humankind and humanity. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=179.04s)]
*  We go now to Bell Court, North Dakota, where we're joined by Nick Tilson, founder and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=184.04s)]
*  CEO of NDN Collective, which helped lead the push to free Leonard Peltier. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=189.04s)]
*  He accompanied Leonard home on Tuesday. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=195.04s)]
*  Nick is a citizen of the Oglala Lakota Nation. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=197.88s)]
*  Nick, it's great to have you back on with us. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=201.04s)]
*  Can you describe the moment, as we look at that picture, for the first time you have [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  Leonard Peltier in a traditional native ribbon shirt coming out of prison? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=209.84s)]
*  Where were you? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=215.64s)]
*  What did Leonard say? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=216.68s)]
*  And describe the whole scene back home. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=218.16s)]
*  Leonard Peltier walked out of the front doors of Coleman Prison, energetic and completely [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=224.12s)]
*  dignified. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  When he walked out, he shook the hands of all the corrections officers, and all of them [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  were happy to see him go. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=238.4s)]
*  They had deep respect for him. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=241.68s)]
*  He came walking out, and I stuck my hand out to shake his hand, and he just hugged me, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=243.24s)]
*  and he said, I'm free. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=249.52s)]
*  I'm finally, finally free. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=250.96s)]
*  And he was so excited to get out of the prison. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=254.4s)]
*  We hopped in the vehicle. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=259.64s)]
*  We got him into the vehicle, and we started listening to Redbone and music, and he was [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=260.88s)]
*  dancing in the back seat of the car. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=268.0s)]
*  And it was joy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=271.72s)]
*  It was absolute pure joy to watch him do that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=273.16s)]
*  And then we were able to do a ceremony for him, and to wipe him off, and to bless him, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=279.4s)]
*  and put prayers of protection over him, and wipe him off from the things that happened [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  there in prison. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=291.2s)]
*  And then when we came home, when he got him back to Turtle Mountain, the streets were [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=292.84s)]
*  lined with hundreds and hundreds of people welcoming him at home, holding up signs, cheering, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=298.44s)]
*  singing, war hooping. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  It was a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful sight. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=307.84s)]
*  I remember seeing the sign that said, Miigwech, Leonard Paltier, which in the Inishinaabe language, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=310.56s)]
*  Miigwech means thank you, and the amount of love and gratitude in which he was embraced [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=318.2s)]
*  by his community, his people, and his movement. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  It was an absolutely historic and moving day, and Leonard was absolutely joyous when we [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  rolled up to his home that we had got for him. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=334.16s)]
*  And this is the first home Leonard Paltier had had since he was nine years old, since [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=338.68s)]
*  he was taken away from Turtle Mountain to go off to boarding schools. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  And now he walked into this home that was prepared for him, and he loved it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=348.68s)]
*  And we prayed in that home, and we blessed out that home. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=354.08s)]
*  And Leonard sat down on the couch and said, here, I'm finally home. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=357.92s)]
*  He thanked everybody. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  And that's the thing he wants everybody to know, is he thanks everybody around the world [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  for fighting for him and standing up for him and never giving up on him. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=370.20000000000005s)]
*  And Nick, could you talk about the significance of his release for the First Nations peoples [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=376.92s)]
*  in this country and really throughout the world? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=383.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you know, throughout how Leonard Paltier was treated in his life, how he was treated [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=386.36s)]
*  in his overprosecution and how he was treated in his incarceration is one of grave injustice. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=392.2s)]
*  And that's pretty consistent of how this country has treated Indigenous people since the inception [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=398.68s)]
*  of this country. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=405.16s)]
*  And so the release of Leonard Paltier is something that touches all of us, because it's the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=406.44s)]
*  all of us, because all of us see a little bit of ourselves in Leonard Paltier, and we [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=415.0s)]
*  see a little bit of our struggle in Leonard Paltier. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=419.96000000000004s)]
*  And so Leonard Paltier's release is a day of victory and liberation for Indigenous people [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=422.44s)]
*  and human rights defenders everywhere because of the symbolism of how long this has gone [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  on and the injustice that exists in his life, but also in the world. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=435.88s)]
*  And so to us, it's an acknowledgement. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=440.68s)]
*  It's an acknowledgement that what they did to Leonard Paltier was wrong, what they did [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=442.68s)]
*  to Indigenous people was wrong. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=446.92s)]
*  And at that time in history, when Leonard and the American Indian movement were rising [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=448.84000000000003s)]
*  up, they were rising up at a time in which our ceremonies were outlawed, our languages [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=453.16s)]
*  were outlawed. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=458.84000000000003s)]
*  They were trying to terminate the tribes. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=459.8s)]
*  And that uprising created pride and brought back our languages and it brought back our [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=462.92s)]
*  culture and it brought back our ceremony. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=468.04s)]
*  And it was that very foundation that became the foundation that freed Leonard Paltier, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=470.2s)]
*  because this effort to free Leonard would have not been possible if it wasn't founded [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=475.0s)]
*  in prayer, if it wasn't founded in our belief system that he fought for and that movement [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=480.36s)]
*  fought for. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=485.96s)]
*  And so that's why this is full circle to us. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=487.0s)]
*  That's why this means so much to us as Indian people, that everything that this country [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=490.68s)]
*  did to try to kill us off and eradicate us. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=495.48s)]
*  Leonard Paltier being free, his liberation is a symbolism that no matter what they did [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=498.2s)]
*  to try to wipe us out, that they couldn't do so successfully because we continue to [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=505.15999999999997s)]
*  resist and rise up and be resilient people. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=509.47999999999996s)]
*  And Nick, I'm wondering in the conversations with him, did he talk at all about how he [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=513.3199999999999s)]
*  was treated while he was in prison, how his fellow inmates regarded him or the prison [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=519.24s)]
*  officials as well? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=524.4399999999999s)]
*  While he was in prison, he was treated, I mean, it was hell on earth all 49 years. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=526.76s)]
*  And he was revered and respected by the prisoners, but it was hell on earth. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=536.52s)]
*  He never had proper medical care. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=541.8s)]
*  He never had the medical attention that he needed and he was in maximum security the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=544.3599999999999s)]
*  entire time. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=550.92s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=553.16s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrIAyUgHaf0&t=554.6800000000001s)]
