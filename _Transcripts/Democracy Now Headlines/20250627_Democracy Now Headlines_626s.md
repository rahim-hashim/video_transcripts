# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” June 27, 2025
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=6.12s)]
*  Doctors in Gaza say Israeli attacks have killed at least 72 people over the past 24 hours, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=7.12s)]
*  among the dead six people killed by Israeli forces near an aid distribution point north [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=13.88s)]

*  from acute malnutrition and are at risk of death. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=32.68s)]
*  This is Mohamed Tabasha, a doctor in Gaza City who says Israel's blockade of humanitarian [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=36.0s)]
*  aid, including milk and infant formula, is causing babies to starve. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=41.6s)]
*  MOHAMMED TABASHA, Doctor, Gaza City [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=46.4s)]
*  The lack of milk affects the baby's weight. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=49.8s)]
*  The baby does not grow fast, and hunger may affect the immunity of the baby, whereby one [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=52.16s)]
*  could easily become infected. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=56.44s)]
*  And if his immunity is not strengthened, we may lose some babies due to a lack of available [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=58.0s)]
*  milk, especially the specialized formula that is no longer available from the Health Ministry. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=63.48s)]

*  Notably absent from the briefing was Trump's Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gavrid, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=80.92s)]
*  who told Congress in March the intelligence community, quote, continues to assess Iran [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=85.24s)]
*  is not building a nuclear weapon, unquote. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=89.88s)]

*  No matter how many scientists you kill, there are still people in Iran who know how to work [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=110.72s)]
*  centrifuges. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=115.12s)]
*  And if they still have enriched uranium and they still have the ability to use centrifuges, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=116.12s)]
*  then you're not setting back the program by years. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=122.24s)]
*  You're setting back the program by months. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=124.88s)]
*  The only path forward is diplomacy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=126.48s)]

*  by removing its health clinics from the state's Medicaid program. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=194.24s)]
*  Writing for the dissent, Justice Katanji Brown Jackson said the ruling is, quote, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=197.4s)]
*  likely to result in tangible harm to real people. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=201.84s)]

*  who were detaining a Latino janitor at the shopping center where Martinez worked at a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=324.24s)]
*  local Walmart. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=329.04s)]

*  for proof he was born in the United States. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=335.5s)]
*  Martinez has since been fired by Walmart. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=337.92s)]

*  They'll probably fight back. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoc8ExFZqg&t=386.2s)]
