The Social Security benefits of millions of people in the United States are at risk as the Trump administration institutes drastic changes billed as “anti-fraud” measures, but which critics say are aimed at weakening the popular program and potentially laying the groundwork to privatize it. The Social Security Administration has already shuttered dozens of offices across the country and is laying off thousands of workers. At the same time, the agency is demanding people make more in-office visits for routine business. The changes are part of government-wide efforts led by billionaire Elon Musk and DOGE, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.

“They are destabilizing the program,” says Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works and chair of the Strengthen Social Security Coalition. “It’s really hard to imagine what they have in mind, what their endgame is, other than destroying our Social Security system.”

We also speak with Jacobin staff writer Branko Marcetic, who says Trump’s nominee to head the Social Security Administration, financial services executive Frank Bisignano, has a reputation for slashing costs and pushing out staff. “All of that is a pretty grim portent” of his plans for the Social Security Administration, if Bisignano is confirmed, says Marcetic. “The people that are going to be hurt by it are the actual Social Security beneficiaries.”

# Hands Off Social Security: Drastic DOGE-Backed Changes Put Benefits for Millions at Risk
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ)
*  We begin today looking at how the Social Security administration is considering drastic new [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=0.0s)]
*  measures that could disrupt benefit payments to millions of Americans. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=5.66s)]
*  This is according to an internal memo first obtained by the political newsletter Popular [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=10.76s)]
*  Information. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=14.96s)]
*  Authored earlier this month by acting deputy Social Security Administration commissioner [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=15.96s)]
*  Doris Diaz, the changes proposed in the memo would force millions of customers to file [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=20.44s)]
*  at a field office rather than over the phone. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=26.84s)]
*  According to the memo, customers applying for retirement and disability benefits would [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=29.6s)]
*  be required for the first time to verify their identity through an online system. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=33.4s)]
*  If their identity can't be verified online, they would have to visit a field office in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  person. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=42.36s)]
*  A day before the memo was sent, the Washington Post reported Social Security Administration [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=43.36s)]
*  was considering ending telephone service for all claims under pressure from DOGE, the Department [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=48.04s)]
*  of Government Efficiency. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=54.36s)]
*  Hours after the Washington Post report came out, the agency issued a press release claiming [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  telephone services would not be eliminated. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=60.16s)]
*  The proposed changes to Social Security come as DOGE is targeting the agency for staff [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  cuts of more than 12 percent. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=67.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump's billionaire Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has sparked outrage after repeatedly [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=69.8s)]
*  suggesting only fraudsters would complain if Social Security checks don't go out on [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=77.76s)]
*  time. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  Let's say Social Security didn't send out their checks this month. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  My mother-in-law, who's 94, she wouldn't call and complain. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=91.12s)]
*  She just wouldn't. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=96.28s)]
*  She thinks something got messed up and she'll get it next month. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=97.28s)]
*  A fraudster always makes the loudest noise, screaming, yelling and complaining. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=100.96s)]
*  This comes as self-professed DOGE person, former corporate CEO Frank Bisignano, was [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=109.83999999999999s)]
*  grilled for more than two hours Tuesday by the Senate Finance Committee at his confirmation [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=118.16s)]
*  hearing to lead the Social Security agency. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=122.36s)]
*  This is one exchange with him and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  He's the same 65-year-old, calls the helpline to apply for Social Security, but he's told [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=130.56s)]
*  about the new DOGE rule. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=137.08s)]
*  So he has to go online or in person. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=138.88s)]
*  He can't drive, he has trouble with the website, so he waits until his niece can get [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=141.72s)]
*  a day off to take him to the local Social Security office. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=146.4s)]
*  But DOGE closed that office, so they have to drive two hours to get to the next closest [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=150.1s)]
*  office. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=154.8s)]
*  When they get there, there are only two people who are staffing a 50-person line, so he doesn't [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=155.96s)]
*  even make it to the front of the line before the office closes and he has to come back. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=161.44s)]
*  Now let's assume it takes our fellow three months to straighten this out and he misses [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  a total of $5,000 in benefits checks, which by law he will never get back. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=172.72s)]
*  So Mr. Bisignano, is that a benefit cut? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=181.16s)]
*  Well, first of all, Senator, I enjoyed it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=184.84s)]
*  Is that a benefit cut? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=190.56s)]
*  I enjoyed it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=191.56s)]
*  I'm sorry, my time is limited here. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=192.56s)]
*  That's an easy question, yes or no. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=193.92s)]
*  Is it a benefit cut? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=196.8s)]
*  I have no intent to have anything like that happen on my watch, ma'am. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=200.92s)]
*  Is it a benefit cut? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=202.18s)]
*  I'm not sure what to call it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=206.32s)]
*  It sounds like a horrible situation. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=208.0s)]
*  Is the person getting the $5,000 they were legally entitled to? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=209.88s)]
*  That was your scenario, and so— [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  So are they getting $5,000 they were legally entitled to? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=226.16s)]
*  Social security provides crucial economic security to more than 70 million people and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=227.96s)]
*  accounts for over half the income of most people over age 65. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=233.42s)]
*  One of many protests nationwide, dozens of mostly older adults protested Friday outside [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=238.76s)]
*  a Nashville, Tennessee field office they say is already understaffed with long wait times, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  is on a list of 47 field offices Doge plans to close. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=248.56s)]
*  We're being told, and everything that they say that they're trying not to do, and one [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=253.12s)]
*  of the things they're saying is that they're not going to attack Social Security, and yet [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=261.12s)]
*  all the actions they're taking is attacking Social Security. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=264.0s)]
*  For more, we're joined by two guests. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=267.66s)]
*  In Chicago, Bronco Marcha teaches with us, Jacob and staff writer, where his recent piece [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=269.46000000000004s)]
*  is headlined, Trump's nominated Social Security head knows how to cut. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=273.92s)]
*  But we begin in Washington, D.C., with Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=278.36s)]
*  chair of the Strengthened Social Security Coalition, the co-author with Eric Kingston [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=282.74s)]
*  of Social Security Works for Everyone, Protecting and Expanding the Insurance Americans' Love [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=287.6s)]
*  and Count On. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=293.42s)]
*  Altman has spent the last half century working on Social Security. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=295.18s)]
*  After our interview, she'll be at a rally near the Capitol about defending Social Security. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=299.24s)]
*  Nancy Altman, welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=303.76s)]
*  Let's begin with you before you go off to this rally. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=306.48s)]
*  It looks like the Commerce Secretary, the billionaire Lotnick, who says that his 94-year-old [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=310.04s)]
*  mother wouldn't complain if she didn't get her Social Security check. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=316.92s)]
*  She's the mother of a billionaire. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=320.64s)]
*  And then, finally, Fraudsters would. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=323.34s)]
*  Is laying the groundwork for people to start to expect, perhaps, that they won't get [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=324.34s)]
*  their checks. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=330.38s)]
*  Can you explain what's happening? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=331.38s)]
*  It's really outrageous. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=333.38s)]
*  Donald Trump has a problem. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=337.94s)]
*  He ran around the country, flooding the swing states, saying he would not cut Social Security, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=339.82s)]
*  Medicare or Medicaid. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=345.78s)]
*  But in his first term, he proposed cuts to those programs every single year. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=347.54s)]
*  Now, those cuts didn't go through. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=352.0s)]
*  So what's he doing now? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=353.92s)]
*  He's claiming that there's an enormous amount of fraud, which is a lie. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=355.56s)]
*  There's vanishingly small amounts of fraud. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=359.0s)]
*  So when he cuts your benefits, he'll be saying he's cutting fraud. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  He's not cutting the benefits that you have earned. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=364.96s)]
*  So, talk about what is happening at this point. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=368.84s)]
*  You have, first, the threats of phone service. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=375.24s)]
*  And who are the people who use Social Security and what it means not to be able to speak [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=377.36s)]
*  on the phone? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=381.9s)]
*  Then you have to go to a satellite office. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=382.9s)]
*  Perhaps that office is going to be closed or understaffed. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=385.26s)]
*  You have to wait maybe a month to be able to go in. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=387.18s)]
*  And the issue is they're closing these offices all over. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=391.62s)]
*  What's happening to Social Security as we speak? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=396.1s)]
*  You know, it's all being done behind closed doors. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=400.46s)]
*  And what's being done, because we're following it very closely and talking to the people [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=403.42s)]
*  who work at Social Security, is they are destabilizing the program. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=407.48s)]
*  The agency could wind up collapsing. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=414.04s)]
*  You've got the Doge minions, Elon Musk's 20-year-olds, running around Social Security. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=417.08000000000004s)]
*  They've been doing it since this new administration. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=424.16s)]
*  They've been forcing people out, firing people, hollowing it out. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=429.76000000000005s)]
*  And frighteningly, they have all of our most personal data, and no one knows what they [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=434.7s)]
*  have in store for that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=440.14s)]
*  But Nancy Altman, this is going to alienate, you know, MAGA Americans who get Social Security. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=444.02s)]
*  We're talking about tens of millions of Americans, as well as Democrats, Progressives, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=452.38s)]
*  Independents. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=457.97999999999996s)]
*  So, what is the response to, for example, your organizing? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=459.08000000000004s)]
*  Who's going out and protesting around the country right now at these over—understaffed, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=463.08000000000004s)]
*  overworked folks at these field offices and the possibility of them closing? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=470.88s)]
*  Yes, it's really hard to imagine what they have in mind, what their endgame is, other [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=475.92s)]
*  than destroying our Social Security system. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=483.8s)]
*  As you said, there are over 70 million Americans who receive monthly benefits that they have earned. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=486.65999999999997s)]
*  They tend to be—they are seniors, people with disabilities, it's the nation's largest [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=492.94s)]
*  children's program. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=498.21999999999997s)]
*  Many of them have mobility issues. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=499.94s)]
*  If they can't use the phone, they really are excluded from getting those benefits. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=503.41999999999996s)]
*  It's really an outrage. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=508.09999999999997s)]
*  And we're trying to get the word out, and I'm so appreciative that you're having this [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=510.34s)]
*  segment because it's really important. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=514.16s)]
*  I don't want to scare people because people are dependent on those benefits to pay their [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=515.88s)]
*  rent, to pay their food. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=521.28s)]
*  And I don't want to scare people, but I do want people alerted. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=524.24s)]
*  Everyone should be rising up and saying, hands off Social Security. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=528.64s)]
*  I want to go to Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=532.4s)]
*  Committee, grilling Frank Bisognano at his confirmation hearing to head the Social Security [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=537.16s)]
*  administration, Wyden citing a tip from a whistleblower and asking Bisognano if he was [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=543.62s)]
*  bringing on Doge team members who could access Social Security beneficiaries' personal information. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=549.5s)]
*  So, according to the whistleblower, you personally intervene to get key Doge officials installed [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=556.5s)]
*  at the agency who have mastermind this shipwreck that we're dealing today. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=565.8s)]
*  Did you talk to anyone at Social Security about these changes? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=572.8s)]
*  I have never talked to Mr. Dudek. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=577.72s)]
*  I have talked to Mike Russo, and I've said that to your staff when they asked me. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=581.88s)]
*  I know Mike Russo. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=589.4200000000001s)]
*  He was the CIO of Shift 4, and he was the CIO at Oracle for Mark Hurd, and I know him [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=591.2600000000001s)]
*  for 20 years. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=600.2600000000001s)]
*  I don't know him as a Doge person. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=601.2600000000001s)]
*  I know him as a CIO. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=603.2600000000001s)]
*  So Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, can you respond to what the nominated [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=606.1800000000001s)]
*  head of Social Security administration is saying, Frank Bisognano? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=612.34s)]
*  He is bobbing and weaving. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=617.04s)]
*  Here's the truth. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=619.04s)]
*  He is describing himself as a Doge guy. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=620.56s)]
*  What that means is, although it's the government of efficiency, it's bringing in inefficiency, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=624.52s)]
*  it's bringing in waste, and it's opening the possibility of massive fraud through identity [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=630.2399999999999s)]
*  theft and so forth. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=636.16s)]
*  He, from the very beginning, has been very aggressive. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=638.16s)]
*  He's still a private citizen. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=641.28s)]
*  He's been nominated. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=643.64s)]
*  He has no role in the government, but he has been all over the Social Security administration. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=645.1s)]
*  He's been working hand in glove with Elon Musk to hollow out the agency and to make [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=649.86s)]
*  these changes where you can't, where you no longer can change your rounding number and [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=656.14s)]
*  you can't finish your claims. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=663.3s)]
*  On by phone, you have to go into field offices, which of course they're trying to terminate [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=665.74s)]
*  all the field offices. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=671.66s)]
*  He is really a part of what is going on and is bobbing and weaving so he can get confirmed. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=674.7199999999999s)]
*  I want to bring in Branko Marchiteach into this conversation, the Jacobin staff writer. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=685.04s)]
*  Your recent piece, Branko, is Trump's nominated Social Security head knows how to cut. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=690.3599999999999s)]
*  Tell us who he is. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=695.3s)]
*  Bissignano was the CEO of Pfizer from 2020 to now. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=697.42s)]
*  Before that he was the CEO of a different payment processing company, First Data. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=705.3399999999999s)]
*  He was a credit card payment processor. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=709.74s)]
*  I think people will think he's being brought on because he has experience in terms of payments, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=711.9399999999999s)]
*  large amounts of payments every single day, every second being processed. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=720.06s)]
*  He'll be good for something like the Social Security Administration where that is so much [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=724.16s)]
*  of the responsibility. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=728.48s)]
*  The thing about Bissignano is that his record as CEO of these companies is relevant in another [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=729.64s)]
*  way. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=736.5600000000001s)]
*  He was responsible for massive cuts to staff levels, to offices, to benefits for workers [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=737.5600000000001s)]
*  at these companies. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=746.32s)]
*  Basically very much the same kind of thing that we've been seeing Doge doing at the Social [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=748.12s)]
*  Security Administration already. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=753.76s)]
*  So anyone who was thinking that if Bissignano is going to be brought in as the commissioner [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=756.38s)]
*  of the Social Security Administration, that there was going to be a change in direction [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=762.18s)]
*  from what we've seen, that the administration, the Trump administration, was going to make [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=766.8199999999999s)]
*  good on the president's promises to leave Social Security untouched, I think should [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=771.1s)]
*  be very worried by his appointment. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=776.26s)]
*  If you could talk about Bissignano's corporate time as CEO of Fiserv, you write, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=780.18s)]
*  Fiserv's glass door reviews are riddled with bitter personal animus. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=789.1999999999999s)]
*  To Bissignano specifically, the decision-making in the company has been extremely erratic [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=796.0s)]
*  since Frank Bissignano took over as CEO. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=801.38s)]
*  Another one, once Frank took over, it became a horrible place to work for. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=805.4599999999999s)]
*  Another said, Frank and his squad, not the greatest, to be H, to be honest. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=810.18s)]
*  Another one, the CEO is a micromanager, only cares about the stock price. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=815.3199999999999s)]
*  Another replaced Frank with a leader who listens. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=819.76s)]
*  Another CEO could care less about employees. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=823.04s)]
*  They're all a widget and an expense to him. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=825.8s)]
*  Mr. Scrooge, at his finest, concluded one. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=828.16s)]
*  And another said, Frank, please go buy an island and move there never to return. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=831.56s)]
*  Talk about the significance of this. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=836.4799999999999s)]
*  And then how it fits in, Branco, to being the head of the Social Security administration. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=838.28s)]
*  I mean, there is a deep, deep dislike, to put it mildly, for Bissignano among the workers [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=846.28s)]
*  of Fiserv. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=852.04s)]
*  I mean, what comes up in these glass door reviews, I would recommend people go and look [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=853.04s)]
*  at them. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=856.52s)]
*  There's thousands upon thousands, most of them well before anyone knew that he was going [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=857.52s)]
*  to get nominated for Trump's administration. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=860.52s)]
*  And they all paint a pretty similar picture. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=863.78s)]
*  Not only do they think that Bissignano is a terrible CEO, someone who has done these [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=865.68s)]
*  massive cuts so that he can just pour billions of dollars of profit back into stock buybacks—and, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=870.6s)]
*  by the way, he's a massive shareholder in Fiserv and actually sold $25 million worth [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=877.08s)]
*  of shares. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=883.72s)]
*  So he is the one profiting directly from this. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=884.72s)]
*  But they also talk about the kind of effect that these cuts have had on them as workers, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=887.6s)]
*  as people trying to make Fiserv do what it's meant to. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=894.92s)]
*  And what they say is that experienced people, some of the most capable workers, have either [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=899.7199999999999s)]
*  been fired because they didn't want to relocate when offices were closed and consolidated [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=904.56s)]
*  in places that were advantageous for tax incentives, or they left because they found that the working [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=909.68s)]
*  so inflexible and so inconvenient that they may as well just go somewhere else. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=920.12s)]
*  And so you have this massive brain drain from Fiserv, while at the same time people complained [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=926.12s)]
*  about their working conditions getting worse, their benefits being cut. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=931.96s)]
*  They talked about having to take on a much bigger workload and having to make that work, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=936.6s)]
*  even though they had now a far smaller staff. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=942.08s)]
*  All of that is a pretty grim portent, I would say, if this is what Pesignano is being brought [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=945.52s)]
*  into the Social Security administration to do, which I think he is. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=951.44s)]
*  It suggests that the people who are left, who are not fired from this massive cost-cutting [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=956.76s)]
*  operation by Doge, are going to be left trying to scramble and keep their heads above water, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=963.0s)]
*  despite the fact that they have far less capability to do so. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=971.44s)]
*  And the people that are going to be hurt by it are the actual Social Security beneficiaries. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP9eCaZPCQ&t=975.32s)]
