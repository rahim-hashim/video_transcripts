Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ordered the termination of all remaining overseas employees of USAID to complete the dismantling of the six-decade-old agency. USAID was an early target of Elon Musk and DOGE. We look at the dismantling of USAID and what it means for people around the world to lose this lifeline, as detailed in a new Amnesty International report. "We talked to somebody who actually saw IVs being ripped out of arms when the stop-work order came down," says Amnesty's Amanda Klasing, who describes the consequences of the U.S.'s retraction of critical aid to countries in the Global South and refutes the Trump administration's claims that no deaths can be traced to the cuts. Now, lacking funding from the wealthiest country in the world, aid workers like Jan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council are turning to other countries' governments to bridge the gap. Egeland says, "The U.S. is leaving international solidarity and compassion completely," even though, as Klasing notes, "It's been the leader of humanitarian aid, and it should remain so."

# "Millions of Lives at Risk": USAID Cuts Lead to Global Rise in Death, Hunger, Poverty and Disease

*  dismantling of the six-decade-old agency. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=24.8s)]
*  USAID was an early target of Elon Musk and Doge, the Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=28.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, the House voted Thursday to approve President Trump's request to claw back $8.3 [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=35.52s)]
*  billion in previously enacted funding for foreign assistance from USAID and the African [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=43.36s)]
*  Development Foundation. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=49.660000000000004s)]
*  The request seeks to make permanent the cuts to foreign aid already imposed by Elon Musk's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Doge. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=57.76s)]
*  Oxfam America warns those cuts could cause 23 million children to lose access to education, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=58.76s)]

*  over 3 million preventable deaths per year. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=73.56s)]
*  This comes as researchers at Boston University estimate that Trump Administration's massive [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development have already led to some 300,000 [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=83.08s)]
*  deaths. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  Billionaire Elon Musk called on Trump to shut down USAID earlier this year. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  And USAID is a ball of worms. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  There is no apple. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=100.92s)]
*  And when there is no apple, you've just got to basically get rid of the whole thing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=101.92s)]
*  For more on the dismantling of USAID and what it means for people around the world, we're [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=108.48s)]
*  joined now by two guests. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=112.0s)]
*  In Oslo, Jan Eglund is with us with the Norwegian Refugee Council. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=113.72s)]
*  He's just returned from a trip to Mozambique. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=117.84s)]
*  And here in New York, we're joined by Amanda Klaessing, National Director of Government [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=120.32s)]
*  Relations and Advocacy with Amnesty International USA, which has just released a report titled [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=124.6s)]
*  Lives at Risk. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=130.08s)]
*  Chaotic and Abrupt Cuts to Foreign Aid Put Millions of Lives at Risk. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=131.88s)]
*  Welcome to Democracy Now, Amanda Klaessing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=136.88s)]
*  Let's begin with you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=139.24s)]
*  If you could outline the main findings of your report, the effects of these USAID cuts. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=141.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=147.88000000000002s)]
*  So we wanted to make sure that there's a full accounting of the impact on lives around the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  world. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  And in the immediate term, we wanted to give a preview of case studies in 12 countries. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  What does it look like for there to be such chaotic and in many ways cruel cuts to programs? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=161.28s)]
*  We looked at programs in Haiti where services for children that have been victims of sexual [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  violence by their gangs, they're not able to access the funding that they were going [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  to provide for in particular girls. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=178.72s)]
*  Or they aren't able to continue the prevention and services for people living with HIV that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  are LGBT or sex workers that have been displaced by gangs. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=187.76s)]
*  We also looked in countries like Afghanistan where internally displaced services for internally [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=191.64s)]
*  displaced people have been cut dramatically and it's leading to women not having access [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=197.92s)]
*  to safe spaces, people losing jobs including women, very few jobs left for them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=202.45999999999998s)]
*  We looked at Yemen, which is one of the biggest humanitarian crises in the world, and looking [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=208.0s)]
*  at the different services for girls and survivors of sexual violence that have been cut and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=214.45999999999998s)]
*  impacted including again safe spaces, psychosocial support. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=220.14s)]
*  In Myanmar, we looked at the Thai-Burma border. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=224.73999999999998s)]
*  We talked to somebody who actually saw IVs being ripped out of arms when the stop work [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=227.14s)]
*  order came down and people having to leave hospitals. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=232.1s)]
*  It's just there's so much about the big data that is out there and speculation about what [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=235.73999999999998s)]
*  this will mean in the long term, but in the short term, the rollout of this policy had [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=242.45999999999998s)]
*  devastating impacts already on lives. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=247.5s)]
*  Secretary Rubio's defiant testimony that said that lives haven't been lost justifies logic. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=250.5s)]
*  Well, let's actually talk about exactly what he said, Secretary of State Rubio, and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=260.74s)]
*  I'd like to get your comment and also Jan Eglund, whose organization, Norwegian Refugee [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=266.7s)]
*  Council, works with aid groups and populations in need all over the world. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=273.53999999999996s)]
*  Exactly what Rubio said before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, claiming no one has died [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=279.82s)]
*  because of USAID cuts, the cutoff of billions of dollars of U.S. support for global health [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=284.97999999999996s)]
*  programs. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=290.65999999999997s)]
*  At another congressional hearing, he said, no children are dying on my watch. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=291.65999999999997s)]
*  Amanda, first you, then Jan Eglund. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=297.17999999999995s)]
*  Again, it just defies logic. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=299.38s)]
*  We have the estimates of the people that have been cut off from aid, cut off from life-saving [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=301.73999999999995s)]
*  care. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=307.34s)]
*  Let me talk to a program in Guatemala. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=308.34s)]
*  So you have to understand, Guatemala has extraordinarily high rates of sexual violence against girls. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=311.38s)]
*  Over 4,000 girls a year become pregnant and have very little access to abortion services, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=315.9s)]
*  and so almost all of them carry their pregnancies to term. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=322.85999999999996s)]
*  There was a program that provided safe nutrition and high quality food to these pregnant girls [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=325.85999999999996s)]
*  that got cut off. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=333.14s)]
*  Now, those numbers might not come in right now in front of Secretary Rubio, but certainly [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=334.46s)]
*  the lives of these girls have been impacted. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=340.41999999999996s)]
*  We have individual stories that when you put them all together, you see that it just is, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=342.38s)]
*  at best, it is a lack of faith to the truth. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=348.97999999999996s)]
*  At worst, it's just outright lies. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=353.17999999999995s)]
*  So Jan Eglund, how would you characterize what the U.S. Secretary of State said, Marco [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=357.9s)]
*  Rubio, when he said, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=363.62s)]
*  Give us a global view. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=364.62s)]
*  And then you just came from Mozambique. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=368.7s)]
*  Talk about what's happening there. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=371.62s)]
*  My organization, the Norwegian Refugee Council, works in 40 countries that are stricken by [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=375.02s)]
*  war and disasters. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=381.02s)]
*  We're a frontline organization. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=383.02s)]
*  And I'll say I and my frontline humanitarian works have all been very impressed with U.S. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=385.86s)]
*  aid, the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance, their work and the very timely aid they have [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=392.5s)]
*  given us and multiple other organizations that are saving lives. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=400.98s)]
*  We in our case give emergency relief to nearly 10 million displaced people. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=405.74s)]
*  In northern Mozambique, which is the emergency that the world forgot, hundreds of thousands [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=412.7s)]
*  of fleeing violence from the Islamic State of Mozambique. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=420.3s)]
*  I mean, Islamic State is defined by the U.S. and other Western countries as a very bad [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=424.14s)]
*  terror organization. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=430.78s)]
*  On top of that, they had three cyclones in the beginning of the year, all climate induced [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=432.94s)]
*  climate ribbon. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=440.02s)]
*  And these are very poor people. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=441.14s)]
*  They did nothing to cause climate change. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=442.58s)]
*  What they see, however, is that companies from North America and from Europe are pumping [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=446.14000000000004s)]
*  gas and oil and taking precious materials, minerals from their soil. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=452.5s)]
*  So when I then also see that the aid cuts that are going most abruptly from the U.S., [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=462.5s)]
*  but also other donors. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=470.94s)]
*  But the U.S. was 60 percent of humanitarian aid in this region, 60 percent. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=472.02s)]
*  And then to go from 60 percent to zero means that the water towers in the camp I was had [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=477.62s)]
*  not been filled. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=486.09999999999997s)]
*  This was an infrastructure paid for by American taxpayers, saving lives because clean drinking [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=487.5s)]
*  water is life saving. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=494.09999999999997s)]
*  It is empty now. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=496.41999999999996s)]
*  The latrines are overflowing. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=497.62s)]
*  People have to relieve themselves around the camp. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=499.22s)]
*  It would lead to epidemic disease. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=502.42s)]
*  Some of it may spread outside of the camp to the nation, to the region, to the world. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=505.06s)]
*  No, it's not the way to build a railroad to take away the biggest aid program in the world. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=512.02s)]
*  Overnight, we're working to get other nations to fill these gaps. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=519.0600000000001s)]
*  We get aid from 40 different donor nations and international organizations. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=525.14s)]
*  But when the biggest one leaves overnight, it really leaves a gaping hole in life saving aid. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=534.54s)]
*  And what about your response, Jan Eglund, to the fact that the Trump administration [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=542.02s)]
*  maintains that life saving aid is exempt from these cuts? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=545.7s)]
*  What is happening in practice, though, on the ground? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=550.9s)]
*  Well, what is happening in reality is that they have left completely Mozambique. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=554.94s)]
*  They have left completely Afghanistan. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=562.22s)]
*  They have left nearly completely the Democratic Republic of Congo, where they were also the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=564.3000000000001s)]
*  largest donor. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=569.4200000000001s)]
*  And what we're then asking is others to step up. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=573.34s)]
*  But again, Norway has five and a half million inhabitants. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=578.14s)]
*  We pay five times more per taxpayer and foreign assistance, five times more. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=583.18s)]
*  It's more than one percent of gross national income goes to foreign aid, 0.2 percent from the US. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=589.18s)]
*  So it's an average nation, the US, in terms of what one is giving per taxpayer. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=597.5s)]
*  And now if the US is leaving international solidarity and compassion completely, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=604.9399999999999s)]
*  they will violate every Christian ideal, every humanist ideal, every ideal of every [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=611.58s)]
*  philosophy and religion. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=618.38s)]
*  I don't think it will happen. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=620.62s)]
*  US has traditionally been one of the more generous nations when children around the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=622.78s)]
*  world are starving. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=629.1s)]
*  Well, precisely, Jan Eglund, I would like to get both of you to respond to this, the fact [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=630.78s)]
*  monumental improvements in both child and maternal health as a direct consequence of [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=636.06s)]
*  humanitarian aid delivered by the US over the last 30 years. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=643.02s)]
*  If you could talk about that. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=647.98s)]
*  And then, Amanda, we'd like to get your response as well. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=649.18s)]
*  No, I mean, it's fantastic what the US has achieved, limiting the spread of AIDS, limiting [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=653.1s)]
*  the spread of epidemic disease, making education there for youth that have left, that had no hope [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=661.02s)]
*  and get hope. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=670.3s)]
*  Yeah, one other example as well. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=671.42s)]
*  I mean, I saw that the US were giving through the Norwegian Refugee Council business grants [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=672.78s)]
*  to displaced families. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=679.1s)]
*  A business grant was $260, not a very large sum, but it led the baker, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=681.18s)]
*  who had fled from Islamic State terror to a camp. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=690.62s)]
*  He could resume becoming a baker. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=695.98s)]
*  He has now a business. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=698.54s)]
*  He sells 300 breads every morning and he has employed a widow and another very poor family [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=700.7s)]
*  man to work with him. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=709.26s)]
*  The US has a lot to be proud of because of its aid. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=712.0600000000001s)]
*  It has traditionally been in the fourth, it's been the leader of humanitarian aid and it [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=716.54s)]
*  should remain so. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=721.9s)]
*  We're not giving up hope to see the US again coming back to the ideals that has been there [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=723.18s)]
*  for all Republican and Democratic administrations since the Second World War. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=729.5s)]
*  And Amanda, placing your response to, in particular, this issue of maternal and child health. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=736.86s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=742.78s)]
*  What's incredible is that the US has also funded the wraparound services and programs [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=743.66s)]
*  that are required to really address the drivers of maternal health. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=748.86s)]
*  And so there have been programs in safe spaces, programs to address gender-based violence, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=752.78s)]
*  programs to increase gender equality, programs to increase girls' education, programs to [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=757.26s)]
*  support women leaders and women human rights defenders. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=763.1s)]
*  All of these programs that aren't necessarily health programs have led to addressing the [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=766.2199999999999s)]
*  very stubborn reasons why there continues to be high rates of maternal death in countries [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=772.06s)]
*  around the world or infant mortality. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=777.8199999999999s)]
*  So increasing all of the quality of life issues and women's rights issues in countries around [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=779.9s)]
*  the world also address maternal mortality. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=786.14s)]
*  And that, for sure, are the types of programs that there is no interest in returning to. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=788.8599999999999s)]
*  And that is part of why we're so concerned that that's not going to be included. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_ZMkkExhk&t=794.14s)]
