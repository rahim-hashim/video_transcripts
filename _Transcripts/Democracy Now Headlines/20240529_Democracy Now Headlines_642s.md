**Democracy Now Headlines:** [May 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffbNanJUvP8)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, Democracy Now!
*  dot org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The White House said Tuesday Israel's devastating airstrike on a tent camp for displaced Palestinians
*  in Ra'a does not cross President Biden's so-called red line in Gaza.
*  Sunday's attack, which set off a fire in the camp, killed 45 Palestinians and injured
*  over 200, mostly women and children.
*  A CNN investigation found Israel attacked the camp using munitions made in the United
*  States by Boeing.
*  White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby was questioned Tuesday by Ed O'Keefe
*  of CBS News.
*  How does this not violate the red line that the president laid out?
*  As I said, we don't want to see Israel.
*  We don't want to see a major ground operation.
*  We haven't seen that at this point.
*  How many more charred corpses does he have to see before the president considers a change
*  in policy?
*  We don't want to see a single more innocent life taken.
*  And I kind of take a little offense at the question.
*  No civilian casualties is the right number of civilian casualties.
*  And this is not something that we've turned a blind eye to, nor has it been something
*  we've ignored or neglected to raise with our Israeli counterparts, including Ed, this
*  weekend as a result of this particular strike.
*  Now, they're investigating it, so let them investigate it and see what they come up with.
*  At the United Nations, Algeria has proposed a new resolution to demand Israel halt its
*  offensive in Ra'afah.
*  Meanwhile, Mexico has become the latest country to join South Africa's genocide case against
*  Israel.
*  Despite the growing international condemnation, Israel is continuing to attack Gaza.
*  On Tuesday, Palestinian medical officials said at least 21 people were killed in an
*  Israeli air attack on a tent camp in Al-Mawasi, in an area Israel has designated as a humanitarian
*  safe zone.
*  The dead included at least 12 women.
*  Over 60 Palestinians were injured.
*  front, aid shipments to Gaza by sea have been halted after a new U.S.-made pier broke apart
*  in rough seas.
*  The temporary $320 million pier had only become operational less than two weeks ago.
*  It's expected to take at least a week to fix.

*  A joint investigation by The Guardian and the Israeli news outlet 972 has revealed Israel
*  has run an almost decade-long secret war against the International Criminal Court in an attempt
*  to derail the court from filing war crimes charges against Israeli officials.
*  The report details how Israel surveilled, hacked, smeared and threatened top ICC officials,
*  including the current chief prosecutor Kareem Khan and his predecessor Fatou Bensouda.
*  The news outlet's report, the former head of the Israeli Mossad, Yossi Cohen, personally
*  threatened Yossouda, telling her, quote,
*  You should help us and let us take care of you.
*  You don't want to be getting into things that could compromise your security or that
*  of your family," unquote, despite the threats by Israel.
*  The ICC's Kareem Khan announced earlier this month he's seeking arrest warrants for
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant,
*  as well as three Hamas leaders.
*  Another senior official at the State Department has resigned to protest President Biden's
*  policies on Gaza.
*  The official, Stacey Gilbert, served in the State Department's Bureau of Population,
*  Refugees and Migration.
*  The Washington Post reports Gilbert sent an email to staff Tuesday criticizing a recent
*  State Department report that concluded Israel's not obstructing U.S. humanitarian assistance
*  to Gaza.
*  Protests over Israel's war on Gaza continue across the globe.
*  In London, police arrested 40 pro-Palestinian protesters Tuesday night after about 10,000
*  people rallied to call on Israel to halt its attacks on Ra'a.
*  In Mexico City, police fired tear gas at protesters outside the Israeli embassy Tuesday.
*  Meanwhile, in Paris, France's lower house of parliament has suspended a lawmaker for

*  school officials sought a court injunction to clear a student pro-Palestinian encampment.
*  Jury deliberations are beginning today in Donald Trump's hush money and election interference
*  trial.
*  During closing arguments Tuesday, prosecutors accused the former president of trying to
*  subvert democracy and quote, hoodwink the American voter.
*  Meanwhile, Trump's legal team attempted to discredit Trump's former fixer Michael
*  testified against his former boss.
*  Trump attorney Todd Blanch called Cohen, quote, the greatest liar of all time, the gloat.
*  Prosecutors reminded jurors that the case rests on the documentary evidence and not just on
*  Cohen's testimony.
*  Trump's lawyer Todd Blanch also told jurors Trump could go to jail if convicted.
*  This led to Judge Juan Marchand admonishing him for making what the judge called a, quote,
*  rages and highly inappropriate remark.
*  Outside the courthouse, the Biden campaign held a press conference featuring two police
*  officers who worked during the January 6th insurrection, as well as actor Robert De Niro,
*  who warned against another Trump presidency.
*  This is the time to stop him by voting him out once and for all.

*  My God.
*  What the hell have we done?
*  We can't have that happen again.
*  In other Trump legal news, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who's hearing Trump's classified

*  The hearings come after historic floods in Brazil displaced hundreds of thousands of
*  people and killed over 150.
*  This is Luisa Tucha of the Tucha people in northeastern Brazil.
*  This is the moment we want the Inter-American Court to hear us hear our cry, hear our call,
*  hear our anguish, feel some of the pain that the indigenous peoples of Brazil have been
*  going through for thousands of years.
*  In Papua New Guinea, rescue efforts are continuing after a landslide killed as many as 2,000
*  people.
*  Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Morapé said the changing climate is devastating
*  his country.
*  In this year we had extraordinary rainfall that has caused flooding in river areas, sea-level
