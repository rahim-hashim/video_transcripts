# Top U.S. & World Headlines — September 12, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [September 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFC1BJ_n_j4)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In Gaza, another Israeli strike on a U.N. school being used to shelter displaced Palestinians
*  has killed at least 18 people, including six UNRWA employees, making it the deadliest single
*  day for the U.N. agency, UNRWA's history.
*  Wednesday's bombing of Central Gaza's Al-Jawuni school led to chaotic scenes, with survivors
*  seen gathering scattered body parts.
*  It's the fifth time the same school has been hit by Israel since October 7th.
*  The Palestinian Foreign Ministry is demanding international protection against the, quote,
*  war of extermination and displacement on our people, unquote.
*  On Wednesday, Hamas reiterated it's prepared to implement the U.S.-proposed UN-backed ceasefire
*  plan announced by President Biden in June without any new conditions.
*  Israel's military has killed four more Palestinians in the occupied West Bank as its deadly and
*  wide-ranging incursion enters its third week.
*  Since August 28th, Israel has killed at least 50 people across the West Bank.
*  In Tulkarim, residents were forced to abandon their homes, taking shelter in a mosque as
*  Israeli forces destroyed houses and businesses.
*  They destroyed our houses.
*  They displaced us.
*  All the people in the camp left.
*  My house was exploded.
*  The army put explosives inside my house and exploded it.
*  The bulldozers swept the house and the rubble covered my neighbor's house.
*  They forced us to leave the houses.
*  President Biden Wednesday called Israel's killing of 26-year-old U.S. activist, University
*  graduate, Ayshidut Ezgi-Igi, in the West Bank totally unacceptable.
*  This comes after Biden received backlash for his previous loopwarm remarks about her killing,
*  which he dismissed as apparently an accident.
*  Biden, however, has not called for an independent probe into her death.
*  Turkey says it's opened its own investigation into the killing of the dual U.S.-Turkish
*  citizen.
*  Russia's military has launched a major counteroffensive to retake territory seized by Ukraine.
*  On Wednesday, the head of Russia's forces in Kursk said troops had liberated 10 settlements
*  in the region.
*  Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has departed Ukraine after committing
*  to keep sending aid to Kyiv.
*  Blinken, however, did not greenlight the use of U.S.-made long-range missiles against Russia
*  sought by Kyiv.
*  This is Ukraine's foreign minister.
*  To defend our people, brave steps from all of our partners are necessary.
*  It's important to lift all restrictions on the use of American and British weapons
*  against lawful targets on Russian territory.
*  We need decisiveness, also in regards to shooting down Russian missiles and drones in Ukrainian
*  airspace.
*  The further Ukraine can strike, the closer a just peace will be.
*  Moscow vowed a, quote, appropriate response if Ukraine used U.S. Atacom's missiles to
*  strike deep inside Russia.
*  In India, authorities have declared a curfew and shut down internet access across the northeastern
*  state of Manipur amidst a surge in violence between the majority METE and minority Kuki
*  communities.
*  At least 11 people have been killed in recent fighting.
*  That includes weaponized drone attacks on civilians launched by suspected Kuki fighters.
*  More than 200 people have been killed since the violence broke out last year.
*  Tens of thousands have fled the region.
*  On Wednesday, student protesters marched to demand an end to the violence.
*  Should we choose war or should we study?
*  Which side should we choose?
*  Governor, respected chief minister, respected president, etc.
*  Please provide the means to stop violence in our small state of Manipur.
*  The U.N. reports 3.2 million children across Afghanistan face acute malnutrition nearly
*  23 years after the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in the wake of the 9-11 attacks.
*  Nearly half of Afghan children are stunted, meaning they aren't growing to their full
*  potential due to hunger.
*  The BBC recently profiled a hospital in eastern Nangarhar province, which said 700 children
*  died in the past six months of hunger and largely preventable diseases.
*  In related news, Australia's military says it will strip several senior commanders of
*  distinguished service medals after a 2020 report revealed Australian Special Forces
*  members committed war crimes during their operations in Afghanistan, unlawfully killing
*  at least 39 prisoners and civilians.
*  Australia's defence minister says prosecutors are also considering charges.
*  In Venezuela, the government of Nicolás Maduro is threatening to cut ties with Spain after
*  the Spanish Congress voted Wednesday to recognize opposition leader and former presidential
*  candidate Edmundo González as president-elect of Venezuela days after he was granted asylum
*  in Spain.
*  But Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who reportedly is meeting with González today,
*  said he will not recognize González as Venezuela's president.
*  This comes as Human Rights Watch warns Venezuelans who have attempted to flee the country,
*  including during the post-election crackdown on protests, have few options for asylum or
*  protection in neighbouring countries, leading them to attempt to cross the treacherous
*  Darien Gap.
*  This is Human Rights Watch chief Tarana Hassan.
*  Cases of asylum seekers and migrants we spoke to at the border, they said that they had
*  actually watched the security forces open fire and shoot and kill protesters.
*  They had watched the collectivas searching for those who participated in the protests.
*  Peru's former authoritarian president Alberto Fujimori died Wednesday at the age of 86.
*  Last year, a Peruvian court released him from prison on humanitarian grounds.
*  Fujimori had been serving a 25-year sentence since 2009 for human rights abuses, including
*  kidnapping, bribery and ordering massacres by death squads.
*  Back in the United States, the father of an 11-year-old Ohio boy who died in a traffic
*  accident involving a driver from Haiti is demanding Donald Trump, J.D. Vance and other
*  Republican leaders stop using his son for political gain.
*  Using Aiden as a political tool is, to say the least, reprehensible for any political purpose.
*  And speaking of morally bankrupt, politicians Bernie Moreno, Chip Roy, J.D. Vance and Donald
*  Trump, they have spoken my son's name and used his death for political gain.
*  This needs to stop now.
*  They can vomit all the hate they want about illegal immigrants, the border crisis, and even
*  untrue claims about fluffy pets being ravaged and eaten by community members.
*  However, they are not allowed, nor have they ever been allowed, to mention Aiden Clark from
*  Springfield, Ohio. I will listen to them one more time to hear their apologies.
*  A new report tracking nearly one million births in New Jersey found doctors are far more likely
*  to submit black birthing patients for cesarean sections over white patients with similar
*  medical histories. The study, published in the National Bureau of Economic Research,
*  found unplanned c-sections on black patients are more likely to happen when hospital surgery rooms
*  were empty, suggesting a financial motivation since surgical births result in higher medical
*  bills. Harvard's revealed the percentage of incoming students who identify as African-American
*  or black dropped to 14 percent this year after the Supreme Court rolled back affirmative action at
*  college campuses. That's down from 18 percent the prior year. Brown, MIT and Amherst also reported
*  dips in black enrollment, though other universities, including Princeton and Yale, did not notice
*  significant changes. Analysts say it could take a while to understand the full effect of the
*  Supreme Court's ruling, which was widely condemned by colleges and civil rights groups.
*  An Amnesty International is calling on President Biden to grant clemency to indigenous leader and
*  political prisoner Leonard Peltier, who turns 80 years old today after nearly a half century in
*  prison for a crime he says he did not commit. Leonard Peltier has always maintained his
*  innocence over the 1975 killing of two FBI agents in a shootout on the Pine Ridge Reservation.
*  His conviction was riddled with irregularities and prosecutorial misconduct. In a letter to
*  President Biden, Amnesty International USA wrote, quote, You have the opportunity to rectify a case
*  that has long troubled human rights advocates and indigenous peoples worldwide, unquote.
*  Vigils and other actions are being held today in Washington, D.C. and around the country.
*  And those are some of the headlines. This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org,
*  the War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman.
