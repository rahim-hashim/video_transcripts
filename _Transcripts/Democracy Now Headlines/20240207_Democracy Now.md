**Democracy Now!:** [February 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX1QXFns4rA)
*  NERMEEN SHAIKH, WEDNESDAY REPORTING, DEMOCRACY NOW, DEMOCRACYNOW.ORG.
*  The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Nermeen Shaikh.
*  A federal appeals court has unanimously rejected Donald Trump's claim that he's immune from
*  federal prosecution for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
*  In its ruling, the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit
*  wrote, quote, we cannot accept former President Trump's claim that a president has unbounded
*  authority to commit crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power,
*  the recognition and implementation of election results.
*  The judges went on to write, quote, nor can we sanction his apparent contention that the
*  executive has carte blanche to violate the rights of individual citizens to vote and
*  to have their votes count.
*  Trump has vowed to appeal the ruling, possibly to the Supreme Court.
*  During oral arguments last month, Trump's legal team claimed the former president should
*  have full immunity to do anything, even assassinate political opponents.
*  In a chaotic day on Capitol Hill, the Republican effort to impeach Homeland Security Secretary
*  Alejandro Mayorkas failed after Republicans fell one vote short.
*  Democratic Congressmember Al Green cast the deciding vote while wearing a hospital gown.
*  Green came to the Capitol directly from a hospital where he was recovering from a recent
*  surgery.
*  Republicans are vowing to hold another impeachment vote on Mayorkas, who they accuse of failing
*  to uphold immigration laws at the U.S.-Mexico border.
*  In a second setback for House Speaker Mike Johnson, Republicans also failed to pass a
*  standalone bill to send $17.6 billion in military assistance to Israel.
*  Meanwhile, in the Senate, a bipartisan $118 billion immigration and foreign aid bill appears
*  to be dead after Republican lawmakers revolted against the very bill they had been pushing
*  for.
*  On Tuesday, President Biden accused Donald Trump of blowing up the plan, which included
*  harsh new border measures as well as new military aid for Ukraine, Israel and allies in the
*  Pacific.
*  Now, all indications are this bill won't even move forward to the Senate floor.
*  Why?
*  A simple reason.
*  Donald Trump.
*  Donald Trump thinks it's bad for him politically.
*  Therefore, he doesn't even know it helps the country.
*  He's not for it.
*  He'd rather weaponize this issue than actually solve it.
*  The ACLU has warned the bipartisan deal would have eviscerated longstanding asylum protections
*  and forced the government to summarily expel people from the southern border without due
*  process.
*  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Israel as negotiations continue
*  over a possible truce and hostage deal that could end Israel's assault on Gaza, at least
*  temporarily.
*  On Tuesday, Qatar said Hamas had given a quote positive response to a proposed deal, but
*  President Biden described Hamas' response as over the top.
*  In its counteroffer, Hamas proposed a three-phased ceasefire over 135 days where Hamas would
*  release all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
*  Hamas is also calling for a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from
*  Gaza demands Israel has so far opposed.
*  As the negotiations continue, the New York Times is reporting Israel now believes a fifth
*  of the hostages held in Gaza may already be dead.
*  The paper cited a confidential Israeli assessment that estimated at least 30 of the remaining
*  136 hostages captured on October 7th have died.
*  Meanwhile, the United Nations is urging Israel to halt plans for a ground invasion of the
*  southern Gaza city of Ra'afa, warning it will lead to a quote large-scale loss of life.
*  Some displaced Palestinians are living in cemeteries in Ra'afa.
*  People were forced to come here to this safe place, which is the cemetery among the dead,
*  which is better than living in residential areas where the houses could collapse over
*  our heads.
*  We come here to live among the dead because of fear and horror.
*  I envy the dead people for their current situation.
*  They are dead, but in fact they are alive with God, well provided for.
*  I envy them because they are better than us now.
*  We live every second in horror.
*  Every minute passing we are in horror, pain, torture, suffering and confusion because we
*  don't know when the war will end.
*  It's a very painful situation.
*  The Israeli newspaper Haaretz has revealed the Israeli military has begun investigating
*  the actions of its own forces during the October 7th Hamas attack.
*  Part of the probe is focused on Kibbutz Bedi, where an Israeli Brigadier General has admitted
*  that he ordered an Israeli tank commander to fire on a home where Hamas fighters were
*  holding Israelis hostage.
*  Brigadier General Barak Haram told the New York Times that he'd ordered the tank commander
*  to quote break-in even at the cost of civilian casualties.
*  Only two of the 15 Israeli hostages survived.
*  We'll have more on this story later in the show.
*  The U.S. Department of Education has opened an investigation into Harvard University after
*  a group of Muslim and Palestinian students filed a federal civil rights complaint alleging
*  the school had failed to protect them from harassment and intimidation.
*  In other education news, two students at Northwestern University in Illinois have been criminally
*  charged after they published a mock version of the school's newspaper.
*  The mock paper included a front-page article accusing Northwestern's administration of
*  being complicit in the genocide of Palestinians.
*  The intercept reports that the students, who are both black, are being charged under a
*  little-known statute written to prevent the Ku Klux Klan from distributing recruitment
*  materials in newspapers.
*  The students face up to a year in prison and a $2,500 fine.
*  In election news, Nikki Haley lost the nonbinding Republican presidential primary in Nevada Tuesday,
*  even though Donald Trump was not even on the ballot.
*  Over 60 percent of Republican primary voters in Nevada selected a box that said, none of
*  these candidates.
*  About 30 percent of voters picked Haley, the former South Carolina governor who served
*  as Trump's U.N. ambassador.
*  On Thursday, Republicans in Nevada will also hold a caucus.
*  Trump is competing in the caucus, but Haley is not.
*  Meanwhile, Joe Biden easily won Nevada's Democratic primary, with about 89 percent
*  of the vote.
*  In other political news, the chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel,
*  has reportedly agreed to resign after coming under intense pressure from Donald Trump.
*  McDaniel plans to step down after the South Carolina primary.
*  Trump is reportedly pushing for Michael Watley, the chair of the North Carolina Republican
*  Party, to become the new head of the RNC.
*  Watley is a prominent election denier who endorsed Trump's false claims about the
*  2020 election being stolen.
*  In California, at least nine people have died as the state continues to be pummeled with
*  record-breaking rainfall from a deadly atmospheric river storm.
*  Some areas of Southern California recorded over 13 inches of rain in recent days, triggering
*  mass, flooding and hundreds of mudslides.
*  This is the actor and filmmaker Deborah Puhet speaking in Studio City as a river of water
*  flowed down the street.
*  We are having these record highs in the summertime and then these incredible storms that we've
*  never had before that they're calling, you know, once every 100-year storms, and we've
*  had two of them since August.
*  So that's my belief is, of course, it's climate change.
*  In Michigan, a jury has convicted Jennifer Crumbly of four counts of involuntary manslaughter
*  for a deadly school shooting carried out by her 15-year-old son at Oxford High School
*  in 2021.
*  Prosecutors argued Crumbly had a duty to prevent her son from going on the rampage, which killed
*  students in what was Michigan's deadliest school shooting.
*  This is Mark Keast, assistant prosecuting attorney in Oakland County, speaking during
*  the trial.
*  Jennifer Crumbly didn't pull the trigger that day, but she is responsible for those deaths.
*  These kids were gunned down inside Oxford High School with this gun.
*  It's a six-hour, nine-millimeter handgun purchased four days before the shooting by James Crumbly.
*  Jennifer's husband and father were the school shooter.

*  These are her works.

*  Hernandez was arrested in February 2022, less than a month after his presidential term ended.
*  He was a longtime U.S. ally who received backing during his entire eight-year term despite
