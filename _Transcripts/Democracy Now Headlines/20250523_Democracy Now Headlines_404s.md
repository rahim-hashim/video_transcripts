Historian Jeanne Theoharis’s new book, King of the North: Martin Luther King Jr.’s Life of Struggle Outside the South, is a major reexamination of the civil rights leader that offers a different picture of both King’s own experiences of police brutality and his sustained critique of police brutality and the criminal legal system in the North as well as the South.

*  Welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Can you start off with another viral moment, an image of police brutality that you describe [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=49.78s)]
*  in your book? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=57.58s)]
*  I watched you talk about it last night at the Brooklyn Public Library, the photo of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=58.58s)]
*  Reverend Martin Luther King being arrested in 1958. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=64.34s)]
*  So, Dr. King, thank you for having me back. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=67.82s)]
*  It's so great to be here. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=72.82s)]
*  So this is 1958. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=74.42s)]
*  Dr. King and Coretta Scott King have gone to see Ralph Abernathy in court. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=76.06s)]
*  The court doesn't want him there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  The police then start to harass him at the courthouse and then decide they're going [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=82.42s)]
*  to arrest him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=86.54s)]
*  They push her away, she's objecting, and they basically march him down the street. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=87.74000000000001s)]
*  But there happens to be a photographer, and so as they're marching him down the street [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  and into the police station, this photographer's taking pictures. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=97.02000000000001s)]
*  And what they do when they get to the police station is they half-nilce him. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=101.14s)]
*  As we see in this photo, onto the counter, they're grabbing his arm and twisting it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=104.42s)]
*  You can tell he's in pain. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=110.26s)]
*  And then once they get out of sight, because as you might imagine, they're mad, the police [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=113.02s)]
*  are mad that Dr. King, that somebody's been taking this picture. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=116.86s)]
*  So once they get him in the cell, they kick him, they choke him, they try to break his [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=120.94s)]
*  arm. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=125.1s)]
*  But this photo goes in the terms of 1958. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=126.46000000000001s)]
*  It goes out over the news wires. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=131.17999999999998s)]
*  And it may be the first, it's certainly one of the first images of police brutality that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=133.42s)]
*  make it into the mainstream news. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=138.54s)]
*  Most mainstream news organizations did not cover police brutality, so this image is outrageous [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=142.17999999999998s)]
*  and it's outraging. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=149.73999999999998s)]
*  And two weeks later, he comes to Harlem and he's doing a nighttime rally on 125th Street [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=151.42s)]
*  right down from Malcolm X's speaker corner, right down from where Johnson Hinton had been [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=157.74s)]
*  brutalized by police, and Dr. King talks about— [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=161.46s)]
*  This is what year? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=164.26s)]
*  This is two weeks after. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=165.26s)]
*  This is 1958. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=166.82s)]
*  And he's there with thousands of New Yorkers and he's talking about his own experience [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=168.36s)]
*  with police brutality. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=173.4s)]
*  And Harlemites are angry and they see themselves in him. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=174.7s)]
*  And I think we often miss this as a key issue throughout the civil rights movement. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=180.1s)]
*  We often put it in the South when Dr. King and many others are calling attention and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=185.84s)]
*  protesting this across the country. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=190.48s)]
*  He said he was more scared in Chicago than he'd ever been in the South. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=192.24s)]
*  But you talk about in 1964 in Harlem also, King decrying the police killing of an unarmed [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=195.68s)]
*  teenager was sued by the New York police officer who killed the young man. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=201.38s)]
*  And there was a march there that actually dwarfed the march on Washington in 63? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=206.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=210.84s)]
*  There were huge marches that what you're referring to is he calls for this officer, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=211.84s)]
*  Thomas Gilligan, he calls what he does a murder, just like you were just doing about George [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=216.46s)]
*  Floyd, the police murder. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=221.2s)]
*  Oh, he was convicted. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=222.56s)]
*  And the cop sues him for damage to his reputation. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=224.22s)]
*  And one of the—you know, in all the newspapers then let the cop launder his reputation. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=227.24s)]
*  So King comes to New York. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  Mayor Wagner invites King, thinking King is going to maybe help quiet down these protests. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=236.32s)]
*  They're massive protests for days. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=240.8s)]
*  And instead, King, in a series of meetings with the mayor, says you need to have—you [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  need to fire the cop. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=248.36s)]
*  You need to have real civilian complaint review board. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=249.52s)]
*  You need to have a jobs program. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=254.4s)]
*  You need to desegregate. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  Mayor Wagner rejects it all. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=258.0s)]
*  And basically, King has like almost run out of town for the notion that he's calling [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=259.76s)]
*  for a kind of real civilian oversight of the police. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  And this is 1964 here, right here in New York City. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=267.6s)]
*  Professor Thea Harris, we just have a minute, and we're going to do a post show and post [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=270.8s)]
*  it at democracynow.org to talk about the revelations in this book. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  How could we be talking about revelations about Dr. King, because he's been written [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=278.44s)]
*  about so thoroughly, yet it's this radical history, especially around police killings [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=282.72s)]
*  of black men and women, that you say has really not been thoroughly documented? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I think we've southernized Dr. King. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  And so his critique of police brutality outside the South, his longstanding critique of school [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=300.64s)]
*  segregation, of housing segregation, of job discrimination, King sees these as national, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=306.4s)]
*  not local. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=312.08s)]
*  But again, we've told a story where King is in the South until 1965, and somehow then, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  when Watts erupts, then he discovers the North, when in fact Dr. King had been in L.A. more [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=319.76s)]
*  than 15 times before the Watts uprising, had been protesting around police brutality [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=326.72s)]
*  for years, joined a movement in 1962 protesting the police killing of the Nation of Islam [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=332.72s)]
*  Secretary Ron Stokes, had talked about this is King, no compromise on this issue in L.A. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  in 1962. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=344.8s)]
*  In 1963, calling L.A. as segregated as Birmingham, even while he's engaged in the movement in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=346.32000000000005s)]
*  Birmingham. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=352.64s)]
*  But we tend to see that as a southern story when King is talking about everywhere. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=353.12s)]
*  And that's why you titled the book King of the North. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=359.36s)]
*  We're going to talk more about it at democracynow.org. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=362.0s)]
*  Gene Theoharis' historian, new book, King of the North, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Life of [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q8pWZg_5w&t=365.03999999999996s)]
