Israel has shattered the Gaza ceasefire agreement with Hamas, launching a massive wave of airstrikes overnight that killed hundreds of people across the Palestinian territory and wounded many others. The surprise attacks came amid stalled talks on how to extend the ceasefire signed in January, though Israel has signaled for weeks that it wanted to resume the war on Gaza. Dr. Feroze Sidhwa, an American trauma surgeon volunteering at Nasser Hospital, describes some of the horrific injuries he has treated, and says it’s “heartbreaking” for Palestinians to suffer more bloodshed. “It’s all because we provide the funding, the diplomatic, the economic and the military support. And we don’t have to,” he tells Democracy Now! “We didn’t have to under Biden. We certainly don’t have to under Trump.”

We also speak with Palestinian journalist Abubaker Abed in Deir al-Balah, and Palestinian human rights attorney Diana Buttu.

# “Another Round of Senseless Mass Killing”: Report from Gaza Hospital as Israeli Strikes Kill 400+
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs)
*  Israel's UNO laterally ended the two-month-old Gaza ceasefire agreement, launching a massive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=0.0s)]
*  wave of airstrikes overnight that killed at least 400 people and wounded more than 560 [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=5.04s)]
*  others, numbers that are expected to rise, with scores of victims still trapped in the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=10.4s)]
*  rubble. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=14.76s)]
*  Palestinian health officials say many of the dead are children. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=15.76s)]
*  The attacks began without warning, though earlier today Israel's military warned residents [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=20.1s)]
*  of several parts of Gaza to evacuate immediately after declaring their neighborhoods to be [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=24.36s)]
*  dangerous combat zones. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=28.76s)]
*  This is a survivor of an Israeli attack on Al Mawasi area of Khan Yunis. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  We woke up and got out of our tents to the streets. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=36.04s)]
*  They fired a missile here near us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  We looked around and found fire coming from the strike. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  While we ran to see what happened, we found a second missile that had been fired. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=46.8s)]
*  The tents were on fire. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  The women started to scream, and the children were terrified. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Of course, everything escalated suddenly. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=56.12s)]
*  We ran towards the scream. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  Then we came here and started to pull out the injured people and those who had been [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=60.76s)]
*  martyred. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  The White House said Israel gave the U.S. advance warning about its renewed assault [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=66.24s)]
*  on Gaza. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=72.32s)]
*  Even before the airstrikes, Palestinians were suffering for more than two weeks of an Israeli-imposed [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=73.62s)]
*  blockade on all humanitarian and fuel aid to Gaza. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=78.08s)]
*  On Sunday, UNICEF reported a third of young children in northern Gaza are suffering from [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=84.56s)]
*  acute malnutrition, adding, quote, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=88.04s)]
*  "...one million children are living without the very basics they need to survive yet again." [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=90.48s)]
*  Unquote. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=96.2s)]
*  Already strained from 15 months of war and a two-week siege, hospitals in Gaza are struggling [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=97.2s)]
*  to keep pace with this new wave of deadly attacks. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=103.38s)]
*  Just before today's broadcast, we reached Dr. Feroz Sidwa, an American trauma surgeon [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=107.64s)]
*  volunteering at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Yunis, Gaza. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=113.0s)]
*  This is Feroz Sidwa. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=118.44s)]
*  I'm a trauma surgeon in California currently volunteering at the Nasser Medical Complex [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=119.44s)]
*  in Khan Yunis on the western side of Khan Yunis in Gaza. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=124.1s)]
*  Overnight, the Israelis resumed bombardment of Gaza. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=129.6s)]
*  The latest reports are that about 400 people were killed. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=134.88s)]
*  I know at least 40 arrived dead at our own hospital. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=138.28s)]
*  Certainly many more went on to die and many more will die in the future. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=143.68s)]
*  Overnight, I think it's hard to remember now, but I think I did six operations. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=148.4s)]
*  I'm about to do a seventh one right now, which is why I can't join you live. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=153.08s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, half of them were children. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  Half of the patients I saw in the ER were also children, just like last time when I [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=161.28s)]
*  was at Gaza European Hospital. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=165.0s)]
*  About a year ago, half the victims were children. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=168.36s)]
*  Half the operations I did were children. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=170.88000000000002s)]
*  Probably a good third of them will go on to die despite us being able to take care of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  them properly just because we really, we can do the initial operations, but we don't have [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  the facilities or the ability to take care of them properly after that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=182.52s)]
*  And on top of that, they're all coming in malnourished. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  They're all dehydrated. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=189.88000000000002s)]
*  They've all had gastroenteritis constantly for the past 15 months. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=190.88000000000002s)]
*  The whole human society here is just devastated, and that results in bad health outcomes, as [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=196.0s)]
*  you can imagine, especially when you get your intestines torn open. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=201.96s)]
*  One of my Palestinian colleagues, his father-in-law has been killed just a few hours ago. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=206.88s)]
*  He was actually running the triage in the emergency room, so keeping people outside, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=213.4s)]
*  making sure that people could access the hospital who actually needed it, and the kind of what [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=220.56s)]
*  we call walking wounded, people who were injured but could wait to be seen were kept in a separate [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=224.72s)]
*  place. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=231.16s)]
*  His father-in-law was killed, and he found out about that like an hour into the process [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=232.16s)]
*  of the mass casualty event. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=235.28s)]
*  Just kept working. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  Didn't go to see him until he'd already been buried this morning because he had to take [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  care of his patients. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=244.12s)]
*  One of the women who I operated on, 29-year-old woman, her sacrum, lowest bone on your spine, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=245.12s)]
*  between your spine and your pelvis, has a tennis ball-sized hole in it, which is basically [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=251.24s)]
*  the whole sacrum. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=258.24s)]
*  Her rectum was torn in half. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=261.24s)]
*  Her bladder is injured. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=263.04s)]
*  Her vagina is injured. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=264.04s)]
*  She's a 29-year-old woman. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=267.04s)]
*  She's actually the sister of one of the doctors who works at the hospital. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=268.24s)]
*  I didn't find that out until after I operated on her. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=271.16s)]
*  It's obviously quite devastating. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=278.48s)]
*  I suspected that the war would restart while I was here, while I was volunteering on this [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=282.04s)]
*  trip, because the Israelis basically announced that they would restart it while I was here. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=287.56s)]
*  But nevertheless, it's kind of heartbreaking to see a return to that same bare level of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=293.44s)]
*  anything to survive that the Palestinians have been forced to do for the past 15, 16 [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=305.04s)]
*  months. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  They got about a month and a half break from a little bit of normalcy with the ability [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  to eat with their families during Ramadan, even if it wasn't a tent. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  The ability to drink water that was at least desalinated, if not clean, and fit for human [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=323.08000000000004s)]
*  consumption. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=329.16s)]
*  That's all gone again. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=331.12s)]
*  It's all because we provide the funding, the diplomatic, the economic, and the military [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=333.12s)]
*  support. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=337.28s)]
*  And we don't have to. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=338.28s)]
*  We didn't have to under Biden. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=339.84s)]
*  We certainly don't have to under Trump. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=340.84s)]
*  Trump says he wants to end the endless wars. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  So, okay, do it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=344.91999999999996s)]
*  It's not that hard. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  All you have to do is stop providing the arms for them. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=346.91999999999996s)]
*  But yeah, Americans, I just hope people will do something about this and not let this happen [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  again. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=356.32s)]
*  Another round of just extreme senseless mass killing, mostly of children, mostly of refugees, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=357.32s)]
*  and mostly of people who are literally barred from leaving this concentration camp that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=364.92s)]
*  they were born into. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=369.48s)]
*  That's Dr. Feroz Sidwa, trauma surgeon, volunteering at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Yunis, Gaza, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=371.48s)]
*  with Medglobal. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=378.6s)]
*  Last year, he volunteered at the European Hospital in Khan Yunis to see our interview [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=380.24s)]
*  with him last week when he just arrived at Nasser Hospital. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=384.44s)]
*  Go to democracynow.org. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=388.12s)]
*  For more, we are going right now to Gaza. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=390.5s)]
*  We are joined right now by Abu Bakr Abed. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=396.76s)]
*  He is in Deir Ebalah, which has been hit hard. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=403.1s)]
*  We'll see if we can keep this connection going. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=405.96s)]
*  Abu Bakr, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=408.88s)]
*  Abu Bakr is a 22-year-old journalist. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  He used to be a soccer commentator, but now, as he says, he's an accidental war correspondent. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  Describe the scene in Deir Ebalah, Abu Bakr. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there are very chaotic and hectic scenes coming out from every place. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=423.15999999999997s)]
*  We're talking about several bombings that have happened since the very, very early morning, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=431.0s)]
*  particularly here in this place. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=435.88s)]
*  And we talk about the casualties, how we were hearing people's screams, people's wails. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=440.12s)]
*  I could hear my neighbors wailing in pain over their loved ones and over their children. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=446.32s)]
*  It was— [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=453.92s)]
*  We're having trouble keeping that line going, but we absolutely thought it was worth attempting. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=454.92s)]
*  It's something we've never imagined. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=465.8s)]
*  And it can tell, to me, this being—that the attacks started to happen. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=466.8s)]
*  We're going to try to reconnect with him. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=473.92s)]
*  You can see it's extremely difficult. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=479.08000000000004s)]
*  Israel has shattered the ceasefire, is bombing all through Gaza. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=482.04s)]
*  But we're going to turn right now to Deanna Butu, Palestinian human rights attorney, former [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=486.24s)]
*  negotiating team of the Palestine Liberation Organization. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=492.44s)]
*  Deanna, you heard a moment, Abu Bakr. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=495.88s)]
*  Before that, you heard Dr. Feroz. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=498.92s)]
*  And, of course, you're getting reports since the Israel shattered the ceasefire. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=500.28s)]
*  Can you describe what has taken place, the shattering of these negotiations and what [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=506.04s)]
*  it means? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=512.16s)]
*  It's really important, Amy, to keep in mind that what Israel's doing is it's actually [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=513.16s)]
*  just uniformly bombing Palestinians because it can. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=519.28s)]
*  Over 90 percent of the buildings in the Gaza Strip have already been bombed. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=525.04s)]
*  And so what Israel claims that it's doing is that it's targeting structures, and yet [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=529.76s)]
*  there's nothing there any longer. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=535.84s)]
*  So this is not—it's not at all surprising that we've seen the death toll reach 413, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=537.84s)]
*  with over 560 Palestinians who are injured. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=543.88s)]
*  We're expecting that this death toll is going to rise substantially over the next few hours. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=547.48s)]
*  And it's because Israel used over 100 airplanes to attack all throughout the Gaza Strip. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=553.64s)]
*  And the reason that they're doing so is because there's been nobody that has stopped Israel. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=561.24s)]
*  All that we've seen over the course of the past 15 months is a demand that Palestinians [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=565.96s)]
*  somehow negotiate with the Israelis. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  And there's been absolutely no guarantee that Israel's going to stop the bombing, that it's [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=576.4599999999999s)]
*  going to allow humanitarian aid, that it's going to rebuild Gaza, and that it's going [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=580.5799999999999s)]
*  to have Palestinians lead a normal life. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=584.8199999999999s)]
*  And so we're seeing this because Israel knows that it can get away with it, and it knows [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=587.66s)]
*  that it can get away with it because it got away with it during the previous administration, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=592.66s)]
*  and it's certainly going to get away with it under the Trump administration. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=596.78s)]
*  Diana, what kind of a notice did the residents of Gaza receive before these attacks happened? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=601.38s)]
*  Israel is claiming that the negotiations reached a dead end, but did they really negotiate [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=610.1800000000001s)]
*  it all? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=615.7800000000001s)]
*  No, they never negotiated it all. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=616.7800000000001s)]
*  That was also another one of the problems. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=619.94s)]
*  We had the first phase of the negotiations, which Israel both halted and as well was violating. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=622.36s)]
*  And then it never entered into any earnest negotiations over the second phase, and that [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=629.02s)]
*  second phase was going to lead to Israeli withdrawal and, of course, reconstruction [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=633.54s)]
*  and so on. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=638.4200000000001s)]
*  So much so that the Israelis failed to send their negotiators most of the times. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=639.86s)]
*  So it was clear that what Israel wanted was that it wanted to continue to resume the attacks [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=644.5s)]
*  on the Gaza Strip, that this pause was simply a pause in order to change the different U.S. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=650.38s)]
*  administrations. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=656.3000000000001s)]
*  But then that's it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=657.62s)]
*  And once again, it goes back to this issue of whether it is that Israel can get away [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=658.62s)]
*  with committing these massive war crimes. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=663.66s)]
*  And it's clear to Israelis and to Israel that it can, unless there is some international [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=667.2199999999999s)]
*  action to actually bring Israel to a halt, to stop the weapons flow, to put sanctions [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=672.9799999999999s)]
*  on Israel, to hold these criminals to account. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=677.8599999999999s)]
*  I'm afraid we're going to continue to see this, and we knew this when the ceasefire [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=680.54s)]
*  agreement was signed. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=684.5s)]
*  Diana, I want to try once again, because it is so rare. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=687.3s)]
*  As people who watch corporate media know, they almost get nothing out of Gaza directly. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=690.62s)]
*  We spoke to Dr. Feroz Sidwa. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=696.02s)]
*  We are continuing to try to get a comprehensible line to Abu Bakr Abed, journalist and Dhar al-Bala. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=699.22s)]
*  Abu Bakr, what is it most important for people to understand? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=706.66s)]
*  And were you surprised by these airstrikes right now? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=711.62s)]
*  People have to understand, Amy, that the Corbusier people are now boiled up in the wounds of [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=717.3399999999999s)]
*  the hospitals. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=724.9799999999999s)]
*  Here at the Laxmata hospital, we've been seeing children, babies, killed and taken [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=725.9799999999999s)]
*  to the hospital, and mothers willing over the bodies of their loved ones. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=731.54s)]
*  People have not yet recovered from the endless trauma they have been through during the past [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=735.0999999999999s)]
*  15 months. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=740.14s)]
*  We haven't taken a breath from what we have been enduring. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=741.14s)]
*  It just happened all of a sudden. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=744.26s)]
*  We were harshly awakened. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=746.9s)]
*  We couldn't really understand what was happening. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=748.22s)]
*  I'm talking to you and I'm literally shaking. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=750.74s)]
*  People have to understand that the people of Gaza cannot really go into any more seconds [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=753.1s)]
*  of this war. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=758.6600000000001s)]
*  This is just indiscriminate, unbearable, insurmountable, inconceivable. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=759.6600000000001s)]
*  I don't know what more I can tell you to describe the scenes at the moment. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=763.6600000000001s)]
*  People don't know. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=768.1800000000001s)]
*  We have right now overpricing and scarcity of food items. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=769.54s)]
*  People don't know. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=774.0999999999999s)]
*  People have spent their days the past 24 hours without a single meal at all. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=775.0999999999999s)]
*  I know families have been to good families. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=780.2199999999999s)]
*  And for me personally, I just had some bread along with some cheese. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=782.0999999999999s)]
*  The prices are insane. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=785.54s)]
*  Everything is going right now is absolutely insane. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=787.38s)]
*  It's just about, like, you're hearing your neighbors screaming in pain. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=791.06s)]
*  That kind of screams and that kind of several bombings that have happened over time has [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=797.8199999999999s)]
*  just revoked a lot of painful memories that I've been through and that I've had during [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=805.1s)]
*  the past 15 months. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=811.06s)]
*  We needed our time to take some rest. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=812.66s)]
*  We said that the ceasefire would secure some peace for us or some tranquility, some rest [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=815.1s)]
*  from what we have been enduring. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=821.02s)]
*  But unfortunately, it seems otherwise. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=822.8199999999999s)]
*  Now we're getting back to it. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=824.22s)]
*  We're talking about more than 400 people have been killed, mostly children. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=825.62s)]
*  Here in Dari Al-Balah, at least 20 people have been killed. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=829.94s)]
*  We're talking about a family that lives near us that has been wiped out, more than [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=832.98s)]
*  seven people, and another family almost wiped out with more than five members. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=836.22s)]
*  That is literally unbearable. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=841.26s)]
*  We cannot really have a genocide rolling back again. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=843.34s)]
*  We cannot really allow the word—I don't know why the word. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=846.34s)]
*  We wanted the word to do us a favor and left to blockade, the current to blockade. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=850.3000000000001s)]
*  But the word allowed Israel to continue to resume the genocide. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=854.86s)]
*  This is literally unbearable. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=859.34s)]
*  I can't tell you how we're feeling, how the children are feeling. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=860.7800000000001s)]
*  Now in Dari Al-Balah, we've gone away right now. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=864.62s)]
*  We visited one of the nearby centers, the desalination appliance, and they've told [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=868.82s)]
*  us that they don't have a single drop of potable water. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=872.7800000000001s)]
*  So Dari Al-Balah is devoid of a single drop of water, of potable water for the population. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=877.46s)]
*  So how can we cope? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=882.9000000000001s)]
*  We cannot really brace ourselves for starvation again, for bombardment again. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=884.14s)]
*  We cannot really blot out our pain because we don't have the means to live. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=889.38s)]
*  I wanted to ask Diana Buto, the reports from the AP, press reports in recent days that [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=893.34s)]
*  the United States and Israel have reached out to three African governments, Sudan, Somalia, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=901.34s)]
*  and Somaliland for possibly hosting Palestinians who would be removed from Gaza. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=907.74s)]
*  Your reaction to that? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=914.4599999999999s)]
*  It's not at all surprising. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=916.26s)]
*  This is exactly what Israel has been wanting to do, which is to commit genocide as well [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=918.54s)]
*  as ethnically cleanse Gaza. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=923.36s)]
*  And the fact that we're seeing these plans go ahead, despite the fact that both of them [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=925.3399999999999s)]
*  are illegal under international law, shows you the state of the world. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=930.14s)]
*  And so it's not at all surprising that they have been doing this, because from the beginning [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=934.38s)]
*  of the genocide, since October of 2023, Netanyahu made it clear that he wanted the Gaza Strip [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=939.18s)]
*  to be smaller in size and thinner in population. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=945.42s)]
*  What that means is that he wants to see ethnic cleansing, he wants to see genocide, and he [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=949.26s)]
*  wants to see the takeover of the land of the Gaza Strip. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=953.5s)]
*  And with President Trump, this is precisely what they're implementing. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=957.42s)]
*  And I wanted to ask you, Dionne Butu, about Israeli prosecutors agreeing to cancel a planned [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=961.1800000000001s)]
*  hearing today in the prime minister, in Netanyahu's corruption trial, due to his launching this [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=967.1s)]
*  major assault on Gaza. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=973.82s)]
*  Do you think that's what's motivating it? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=975.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=978.0600000000001s)]
*  Look, a lot of what Israel has been doing lately and what Netanyahu has been doing lately [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=979.0600000000001s)]
*  is in order to save his own political career. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=983.1800000000001s)]
*  He's a deeply unpopular prime minister. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=987.1800000000001s)]
*  Israelis are looking at him and blaming him for not only corruption, but for everything [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=990.9s)]
*  that's going on in the country. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=996.02s)]
*  And in order to save his hide, to prevent himself from going into prison, he's been [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=998.5s)]
*  doing everything to try to prolong this genocide. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1005.3s)]
*  He's been doing everything so that Palestinians are the ones who are paying the price with [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1009.4599999999999s)]
*  their bodies, literally, in order to prevent Netanyahu from going into prison. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1014.38s)]
*  The breaking news— [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1020.74s)]
*  I want to— [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1021.74s)]
*  The breaking news, Juan, the Uttamah Yehudit Jewish Power Party, led by the far-right lawmaker [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1022.74s)]
*  Itamar Ben-Ghavir, is returning to Netanyahu's coalition government. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1027.98s)]
*  The hardline party, which opposed a ceasefire with Hamas and pressed for Israel to cut off [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1032.66s)]
*  aid to Gaza, had left the coalition in January. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1036.98s)]
*  Now the return strengthens Netanyahu's position before a crucial budget vote expected next [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1040.06s)]
*  week. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1047.1000000000001s)]
*  Your response to that, Diana? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1048.1000000000001s)]
*  Yes, this was also not at all surprising, because what Ben-Ghavir—this is a man who's [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1050.4199999999998s)]
*  racist, fascist, who's called for the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians—what he was saying [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1055.54s)]
*  at the beginning was that he never wanted to see a ceasefire, that he wants to see Palestinians [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1060.1399999999999s)]
*  from Gaza ethnically cleansed from Gaza. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1064.86s)]
*  He withdrew from the coalition over the idea of a ceasefire agreement. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1067.62s)]
*  And now that Israel has resumed the genocide, he's come back into the fray in order to [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1072.86s)]
*  make Netanyahu's coalition even stronger, so that he can then not only pass the budget, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1078.1399999999999s)]
*  but continue to be able to put into place these genocidal policies. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1083.5s)]
*  One thing that's important to keep in mind is that Ben-Ghavir is also the person who's [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1088.8999999999999s)]
*  been pushing for Israeli settlers to come and take over the Gaza Strip. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1092.02s)]
*  So what we're now seeing is a combination of the continuation of genocide, as well as [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1096.82s)]
*  pushing forward—we're probably going to see pushing forward plans for Israeli settlers [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1102.02s)]
*  to take over the Gaza Strip, something that they were talking about from the very beginning. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1106.5s)]
*  And Abu Bakr Abed, if you could still hear us, I wanted to know what the—even before [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1110.1000000000001s)]
*  Israel resumed bombing, what was the situation in terms of receiving aid or water for the [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1116.78s)]
*  people in Gaza? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1123.66s)]
*  For 16 days, consecutive 16 days, there hasn't been a single aid truck allowed into the territory [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1124.66s)]
*  and has exacerbated the situation. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1133.46s)]
*  And even during the ceasefire, we're talking about more than 150 that have been killed. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1135.98s)]
*  Now, Israel, in just seven hours, has killed double this number, over the double—over [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1139.78s)]
*  double this number, in fact. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1145.74s)]
*  And we're now just seeing markets running out of food. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1147.54s)]
*  Like, I've gone out to see if markets have food items at the moment, but they don't [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1150.58s)]
*  have. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1155.42s)]
*  And now, what is the situation? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1156.42s)]
*  We need to talk about the hospitals here. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1158.02s)]
*  They are calling out people to come and donate blood, because they don't have blood. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1160.06s)]
*  Units have talked to a doctor from—the hospital must say right. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1163.42s)]
*  And he told me that the hospital is void of literally every basic necessity to deal with [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1166.42s)]
*  the bare minimum there at hand, the least and the bare minimum there at hand. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1172.3s)]
*  They're trying to treat patients with almost nothing. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1175.42s)]
*  That is absolutely barbaric, because Israel hasn't been allowing aid into Gaza, hasn't [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1178.18s)]
*  been allowing medical supplies, the need of medical supplies, to treat the influx of injuries [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1182.78s)]
*  that have been left because of the war, because of the genocide. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1186.82s)]
*  Now, more than 600, 700 have been wounded in the past 10 hours. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1189.82s)]
*  Well, 400 have been killed. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1199.82s)]
*  More than 400 have been killed. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1201.82s)]
*  I don't know when this will end, but we are hearing about Israeli helicopters in the [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1203.82s)]
*  field along the eastern coast, quite a few meters away, having to sleep all night, until [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1207.82s)]
*  now. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1215.34s)]
*  When can we have this kind of relief? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1216.8999999999999s)]
*  When can we stay, like, calm and have our rights as a human? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1221.1399999999999s)]
*  We're still in the same bubble. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1226.98s)]
*  Palestinians dream to left. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1228.82s)]
*  The whole world dream. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1230.62s)]
*  We want to go out of that zone and have dreams, no dreams, even the dream that we want to [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1232.3799999999999s)]
*  left is no longer visible. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1237.5s)]
*  That is the peak of the humanization. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1240.26s)]
*  That is millions, many dreams in Gaza have been destroyed. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1242.6999999999998s)]
*  Many dreams have been crushed. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1246.46s)]
*  Many families are still under the rubble. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1247.98s)]
*  We haven't even recovered the bodies from under the rubble because Israel hasn't been [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1249.5s)]
*  allowing the vehicles into Gaza. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1253.1s)]
*  The Boldoz and the Qatar bills, people wanted to build a new life. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1255.26s)]
*  Israel didn't allow that. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1258.78s)]
*  Israel wants clearly to erase every sign of hope inside Gaza, but we continue to hope, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1260.06s)]
*  we continue to carry that. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1267.02s)]
*  And even if we, it's not our time, the next generations will carry that hope until we [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1268.86s)]
*  make sure that we live the life we want because we are humans and we deserve to live and we [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1274.3000000000002s)]

*  Abu Bakr Abed speaking to us from Gaza from Deir Abul Ah, which has been very hard hit. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1279.26s)]
*  He also reports for Dropsite News. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1286.0600000000002s)]
*  Deanna Butuh, we want to thank you for being with us, Palestinian human rights attorney, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nf-6InPuxs&t=1288.7800000000002s)]
