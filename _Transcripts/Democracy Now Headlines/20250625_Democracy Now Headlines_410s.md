At the NATO summit in the Hague, almost all European nations reached an agreement to raise military spending to 5% of each county’s GDP. This comes as President Trump said the U.S. would not come to the defense of other NATO nations unless they hit 5% in military spending. “Trump wants to move towards a much, much more instrumental and crudely material, transactional politics,” says Richard Seymour, writer, broadcaster and activist. “I think this is a version of imperial decline that Trump is trying to manage.”

# "Imperial Decline": NATO Nations Boost War Spending at Trump's Urging as He Defends Iran Bombing
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González speaking at the NATO summit. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=3.36s)]
*  President Trump has defended the U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, claiming the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  attack set back Iran's nuclear program by decades. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Trump made the comment today after a number of news outlets reported a classified Defense [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=17.36s)]
*  Intelligence Agency assessment found the strikes likely set back Iran's program by a few [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=21.8s)]
*  months. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=27.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump's praised other NATO nations for agreeing to drastically ramp up military [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=28.16s)]
*  spending to 5 percent of GDP within a decade. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=32.72s)]
*  Spain, however, pushed back, saying the goal was unreasonable. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=36.0s)]
*  Trump spoke earlier today. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=39.44s)]
*  I've been asking them to go up to 5 percent for a number of years, and they're going [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=40.92s)]
*  up to 5 percent. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=46.44s)]
*  That's a big—from 2 percent. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=47.44s)]
*  And a lot of people didn't even pay the 2 percent. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=48.44s)]
*  So I think it's going to be very big news. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  NATO is going to become very strong with us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=55.96s)]
*  To talk more about Iran, the NATO summit, we're joined by Richard Seymour, writer, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=58.4s)]
*  broadcaster, activist based in London, his latest book titled Disaster Nationalism, The [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=63.36s)]
*  Downfall of Liberal Civilization. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=68.76s)]
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, Richard. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=71.64s)]
*  It's great to have you with us. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=73.12s)]
*  Can you respond to what has so far transpired at the NATO summit? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=74.92s)]
*  Well, it seems that they've reached an agreement to raise military spending to 5 percent. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=81.2s)]
*  That was controversial. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=88.92s)]
*  You mentioned earlier in your broadcast the protests in Slovenia. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=90.68s)]
*  But there are a number of European states that really don't want to spend that much [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=96.16s)]
*  money. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  Spain, for example. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  In the UK, they have talked about increasing military spending to 5 percent of GDP. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=103.68s)]
*  At the same time, that they're cutting welfare by 7 billion pounds and creating a massive [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=110.0s)]
*  political crisis for the government. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=116.12s)]
*  So it seems there's a real guns and butter dynamic going on here. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=119.04s)]
*  It would be interesting to figure out why Donald Trump has insisted so much on this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=123.16s)]
*  In the past, when Americans have wanted Europeans to spend more on defense, it's been so that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=128.56s)]
*  America could range further abroad and concentrate its efforts outside of the European theater. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=134.92s)]
*  That doesn't seem to be the logic here with Trump. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  Richard Seymour, I wanted to ask you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=147.92s)]
*  The Peterson Institute recently put out a report saying that the United States itself [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=151.44s)]
*  only spends about currently 2.9 percent of its GDP on military spending. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=157.04s)]
*  And over the last 50 years, it's only averaged about 4.2 percent of GDP. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  So Trump is pushing Europeans to spend a greater percentage on the military than even the United [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  States, the military power of the world, is doing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  Who benefits from this other than the weapons manufacturers? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, it seems that the European elites are very much in favor of it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=187.11999999999998s)]
*  This is one thing that Mark Rutte, head of NATO, was very keen to praise Donald Trump [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  for in his very Trumpian missive, talking about how Europe would pay, it would pay bigly, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=200.2s)]
*  not exactly his words, and it would be a great victory for Trump. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=208.12s)]
*  Actually, it seems that part of what's going on here, the logic of it, is that they can [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  achieve through militarization a certain kind of industrial policy, an expenditure aimed [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=217.28s)]
*  at modernizing their economies, that they weren't able to achieve by other means. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  For example, Germany in the last few years has made an effort to overturn a clause in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=229.88s)]
*  the constitution which says, you know, you can't incur debt as a state. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=237.84s)]
*  And they wanted to do that in order to invest in the climate transition. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=243.88s)]
*  The courts struck it down, but now they can spend 100 billion euro on military investment. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=247.32s)]
*  So this is military Keynesianism, and I think that that's a big part of the appeal for [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  governments across Europe, where essentially the project of some form of left social democracy [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=261.48s)]
*  has hit the buffers, has been thwarted in many instances. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=269.4s)]
*  Modernization of the economy by other means is part of it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=275.92s)]
*  But I also think a part of this is political consensus and political management. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=278.12s)]
*  A number of reports have been coming out in recent years talking about how European states [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=284.72s)]
*  need to prepare themselves for war on the unlikely prospectus that there would be a [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=288.88s)]
*  direct confrontation with Russia, and that this feeds into a general sort of counter-subversive [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=293.84s)]
*  thrust, talking about hybrid warfare, about informational politics, implicating the domestic [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=300.76s)]
*  terrain. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=307.84s)]
*  In the U.K. recently, the counterterrorism adviser Jonathan Hall argued that such matters [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=309.4s)]
*  as what he called gender ideology, you know, trans rights, that sort of thing, could in [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=317.68s)]
*  fact be evidence of Russian subversion, and that therefore the U.K. could need counter-subversion [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=321.72s)]
*  laws. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=327.72s)]
*  So there is a logic on the one hand of domestic political economy and on the other hand of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=328.72s)]
*  domestic political management. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=334.2s)]
*  And I think that's as much to do with this as any putative geopolitical sticks with Russia. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=336.8s)]
*  We just have 30 seconds, but President Trump, the first term, was going after NATO, saying [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=345.56s)]
*  they wouldn't support Article 5, the U.S. coming to the defense of another NATO nation. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=350.2s)]
*  But now playing around with that and saying only if they hit 5 percent military spending [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=356.04s)]
*  might the U.S. support them. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=364.2s)]
*  Twenty seconds, Richard Seymour. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=366.16s)]
*  Yeah, briefly, I think the U.S. is abandoning hegemony, hegemony meaning, you know, universal [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=368.36s)]
*  values, multilateral systems that everybody's supposed to benefit from. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=374.32s)]
*  Trump wants to move towards a much more instrumental and crudely material transactional politics. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=378.12s)]
*  So I think this is a version of imperial decline that Trump is trying to manage. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN9E8MOY1os&t=384.64s)]
