# I Was Detained, Deported From LAX for My Reporting on Gaza Campus Protests: Australian Writer
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI)
*  An Australian writer was recently detained for some 15 hours, then deported from a U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=0.0s)]
*  airport for his writings about pro-Palestine protests at Columbia University. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=8.02s)]
*  Alistair Kitchen was detained by border agents after he'd flown from Melbourne, Australia, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=12.96s)]
*  to Los Angeles. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=18.04s)]
*  He reports a border agent told him, quote, "'Look, we both know why you're here.'" [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=19.7s)]
*  When Kitchen said he didn't know why, the agent reportedly said, quote, "'It's because [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=24.54s)]
*  of what you wrote online about the protests at Columbia University.'" [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=28.04s)]
*  Alistair had graduated from a master's program at Columbia last year when the protests against [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  Israel's war in Gaza began. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=36.4s)]
*  He'd written about the student encampments on his Substack page. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=38.16s)]
*  Pena America said, "'Kitchen's detention and deportation was, quote, gravely concerning.'" [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=42.6s)]
*  Jonathan Friedman of Pena America said, quote, "'Kitchen's account fits a disturbing pattern [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=48.84s)]
*  in which border agents appear to be screening visitors to the U.S. for their viewpoints. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=54.28s)]
*  That is anti-democratic and it must be halted,' unquote. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=60.16s)]
*  We go now to Australia, where we're joined by Alistair Kitchen. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=64.16s)]
*  The New Yorker magazine recently published his account of what happened in a piece headlined [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  "'How My Reporting on the Columbia Protests Led to My Deportation.'" [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=72.92s)]
*  Alistair, thanks so much for staying up late to talk to us. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=79.0s)]
*  Tell us the day this all happened, where you were and just what took place. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=83.28s)]
*  Well, I had flown the 15 hours all the way to LAX, and frankly, I was prepared for something [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  to go wrong. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=100.64s)]
*  There's been plenty of media here in Australia about tourists getting detained at U.S. airports [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=101.64s)]
*  for all range of reasons. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=108.8s)]
*  I've written about the protests and I've written critically about the Trump administration. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=111.48s)]
*  So I went ahead and scrubbed my phone, scrubbed my social media feed. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=115.84s)]
*  But just as I got to get into the passport queue for my ESTA, my visa waiver, I was detained [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=122.88s)]
*  and interrogated and told that the reason was, as you say, what I had written online. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=130.68s)]
*  So explain what happened. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=138.28s)]
*  You come off your plane and were people waiting for you there? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, this is crucial. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=147.6s)]
*  They were waiting for me when I got off the plane. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=148.6s)]
*  I didn't even make it into the queue for passport processing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=151.32s)]
*  Instead, the intercom went over, the last speaker, and my name was called. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=154.88s)]
*  I was asked to meet an officer at the back of the room, and he immediately took me away, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  immediately asked for my phone, and then immediately asked for the passcode of that phone. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=166.72s)]
*  I said I'd rather not hand over my passcode. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=173.04s)]
*  He said, that's fine. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=176.2s)]
*  We will immediately deny you entry and deport you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=177.2s)]
*  And that's when I made the wrong choice to hand over the passcode to my phone, believing [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  hoping wrongly that they would see that I'm a writer, that I was writing about the protests [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=191.92s)]
*  in the capacity as a journalist, and that I certainly pose no threat to the country [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  and that I have many loved ones in the U.S. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=204.16s)]
*  Well, describe the scene where you were brought to. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  Who else was there? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  Both detainees like you, how long they'd been there? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, the questioning took place over hours, is that right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=218.72s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=224.04s)]
*  I was first taken to this back room. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  I was sat down. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=230.0s)]
*  The questioning began immediately with this opening gambit about Israel and Palestine. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  I was asked questions about what my thoughts were on the conflict, how I would solve it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  Do I know any Jews? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  Do I know any Muslims? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=247.92s)]
*  I was asked to hand over the names of students, student groups I was involved with, WhatsApp [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=249.39999999999998s)]
*  groups with other protesters, all of which I refused to do. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=254.32s)]
*  And then after some time, after he was satisfied, he then began the process of downloading the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=260.32s)]
*  contents of my phone. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=267.84s)]
*  He went away, disappeared for some time, came back out. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  That was when I really knew I was in trouble because he said to me, Mr. Kitchen, we've [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  found evidence on your phone of prior drug use on your ESTA visa waiver form you represented [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=282.0s)]
*  to us that you had not consumed drugs before. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=290.08s)]
*  That misrepresentation is grounds for denial of entry and deputation. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=293.12s)]
*  That was maybe one to two hours in of a 12-hour process. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  I was interviewed at that point. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=304.88s)]
*  I was interviewed again maybe six hours later in a Groundhog Day moment where all of the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=306.88s)]
*  same questions were asked. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  And in the meantime, I was held in a detention room withâ€”there were five women in there. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  I was the only man when I arrived. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=320.16s)]
*  Can I just interrupt? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=322.48s)]
*  Yes, Amy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=323.6s)]
*  On the issue of drugs, in New York State, you can consume marijuana. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  Can you explain what they were talking about? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=331.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=334.8s)]
*  So previously, they identified that I had consumed and I admitted to having bought [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  marijuana in New York State. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=343.44s)]
*  This is very important for any international listeners of yours. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  If you buy marijuana in California, in New York, you are doing so legally by state law, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  but you're doing so illegally by federal law. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=356.0s)]
*  Therefore, in the eyes of Customs and Border Protection, you are breaking the law and you [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=359.68s)]
*  are misrepresenting your behavior when you said that you have consumed illicit drugs. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=366.24s)]
*  So if you can respond to what the U.S. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=374.4s)]
*  government is now saying to various media outlets, a spokesperson for the U.S. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=377.36s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security said, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=383.44s)]
*  Yes, it is a privilege and I write, and only those who respect our laws and follow the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=385.52s)]
*  proper procedures will be welcomed. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  And they deny thatâ€”DHS said that they denied that they were targeting you for your political [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=391.76s)]
*  beliefs. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  That seems to run counter to what you were told when you were being interrogated. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  Tell us how much into the conversation, into the interrogation you were questioned and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=409.44s)]
*  what the agent said to you about your political writing. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=416.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's contrary explicitly to what they told me as soon as I arrived. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=425.12s)]
*  To this extent, I'm lucky. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=431.12s)]
*  I'm lucky that they were so forthcoming in the moment and so brazen. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=433.44s)]
*  As to say, look, we both know why you're here. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=437.84s)]
*  It's because of what you've written online. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=441.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm going to interrogate you now about what you've written online. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=443.2s)]
*  Now, the DHS now wants to come out and deny that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=447.35999999999996s)]
*  Of course they do. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=452.0s)]
*  And of course they want to focus on the drug case as grounds for deportation. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=454.23999999999995s)]
*  I'm not disputing that at all. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=460.79999999999995s)]
*  Of course, what I'm here to say is that Customs and Border Protection are using the immense [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=462.64s)]
*  power and discretion that they have to search and then to deny entry under politically motivated [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=469.76s)]
*  grounds and politically motivated reasons. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=477.84s)]
*  They're doing so clearly and explicitly in their own words because they disagree with [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=480.24s)]
*  some people's speech. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=485.68s)]
*  They didn't like what I said, so they went looking for a reason to deport me. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=486.96s)]
*  Your final takeaway from this detention and deportation, what you felt you would warn [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=492.64s)]
*  people about? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=502.0s)]
*  Yeah, the first is this might sound severe, but if you don't have a great reason to go to the United [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=506.08s)]
*  States and you're a tourist, this might not be the time. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=511.36s)]
*  The second is that if you have anything sensitive on your phone, do not take that phone. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=514.56s)]
*  Take a burner phone, buy it early, populate it with some content so that it doesn't look suspicious. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=520.32s)]
*  The third thing is if all that fails and you end up in the position that I was in and you were [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=526.88s)]
*  offered, after getting off a 15-hour flight, a choice between deportation and having your phone [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=531.9200000000001s)]
*  searched and downloaded, my view is accept immediate deportation, spend the 12 hours in [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=540.0s)]
*  detention and go home because by the time they're ready to look through your phone, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=546.88s)]
*  they're never going to let you in anyway. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYwdVt3rhI&t=552.4s)]
