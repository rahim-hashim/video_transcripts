# Top U.S. & World Headlines — August 12, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubjRr1UnJ8o)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Officials in Gaza say more than 100 people were killed Saturday in an Israeli attack
*  on a school in Mosque, where thousands of displaced Palestinians had sought shelter.
*  The attack on the El Pabin school in Gaza City was one of the deadliest individual attacks
*  since Israel's war on Gaza began over 10 months ago.
*  Rescue workers said they did not find a single full body among the dead, just body parts
*  often destroyed beyond recognition.
*  Survivors said Israel attacked the school during morning prayers.
*  It's a mosque inside a school.
*  People were praying the dawn prayer.
*  They struck three missiles, and one didn't explode.
*  It's on the rooftop.
*  Remains of people, children and women, the elderly were here.
*  What did they do?
*  Look, these are remains everywhere.
*  They are from the displaced people who fled here.
*  Without a warning or anything, what can I say?
*  I'm speechless.
*  More than 100 were killed.
*  There are still bodies under the rubble even now.
*  Children are missing, and some were injured.
*  What can I say?
*  Israel claimed Hamas was using the school as a command center.
*  CNN's confirmed a U.S.-made GBU-39 small-diameter bomb was used in the Israeli strike on the
*  school.
*  The attack came just two days after the Biden administration notified Congress it's preparing
*  to provide Israel with an additional $3.5 billion to spend on U.S. weapons and military
*  equipment.
*  Congress had approved the money as part of a $14 billion package for Israel in April.
*  Zatea reports part of the new U.S. package includes a direct sale of 6,500 joint direct-action
*  munitions to Israel.
*  In related news, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered a guided-missile submarine to
*  head to the Middle East and for a strike group of fighter jets and Navy warships to sail
*  more quickly to the region as Israel's bracing for possible retaliatory strikes from Iran
*  and Hezbollah after Israel assassinated Hamas leader Ismail Khania in Tehran and a top Hezbollah
*  commander in Beirut.
*  On Friday, Israel continued its assassination campaign by killing a Hamas commander in the
*  Lebanese city of Sidon.
*  Meanwhile, the U.S., Qatar and Egypt have called on Israel and Hamas to resume ceasefire
*  talks on Thursday in Cairo.
*  Hamas responded by saying it supports the ceasefire proposal put forward by President
*  Biden rather than any new plan.
*  Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim
*  Walls, spoke before a crowd of over 15,000 in Arizona Friday in their largest rally to
*  date.
*  During Harris' speech, a group of protesters began chanting, Free, Free Palestine.
*  The vice president paused to respond.
*  And let me just say this on topic of what I think I'm hearing over there.
*  Let me just speak to that for a moment, and then I'm going to get back to the business
*  at hand.
*  So, let me say, I have been clear.
*  Now is the time to get a ceasefire deal and get the hostage deal done.
*  Harris' response to the pro-Palestinian protesters in Arizona marked a notable shift in tone
*  from how she reacted to protesters in Michigan.
*  In other campaign news, Donald Trump has falsely accused Kamala Harris of using artificial
*  intelligence to fabricate photos showing large crowds at her rallies.
*  Last week, Harris spoke in front of 15,000 supporters at an airport hangar in Detroit,
*  but Trump falsely claimed the massive crowd didn't actually exist despite extensive
*  photographic and video evidence.
*  Trump wrote, quote, There was nobody at the plane, and that the massive crowd, quote,
*  didn't exist.
*  This comes as numerous reports emerge that Trump has been shocked by the early strength
*  of Harris' campaign as new polls show her leading in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
*  The New York Times reports the former president has repeatedly called Harris a bitch in private.
*  Russia's ordered residents in parts of the Belgrade region to evacuate as Ukraine expands
*  its attacks inside Russian territory.
*  Thousands of Ukrainian troops are now pushing into both the Kursk and Belgarod regions of
*  Russia in a surprise offensive that began six days ago.
*  Meanwhile, a Russian missile hit a supermarket in eastern Ukraine Friday, killing at least
*  14 people, injuring 43 others.
*  In other news from the region, Ukraine and Russia are blaming each other after a major
*  fire broke out Sunday at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been occupied
*  by Russian forces for two years.
*  Russia accused Ukraine of shelling the plant, while Ukraine blamed Russia for starting the
*  fire which occurred in the plant's cooling towers.
*  In Bangladesh, interim leader Mohammed Yunus has appealed for unity amidst ongoing turmoil
*  and religious tensions as Bangladesh transitions to a new government after the student-led
*  ouster of longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
*  Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, met with and embraced the weeping mother of Abu Sayyid,
*  the first student to have been killed in the unrest last month.
*  On Saturday, Bangladesh's chief justice and central bank governor resigned as protesters
*  encircled the Supreme Court.
*  Students are now focused on unseating officials they say abetted Sheikh Hasina's repressive
*  rule.
*  She's fled to India.
*  The Biden administration's decided to resume sending offensive arms to Saudi Arabia, lifting
*  a ban that had been in place since 2021.
*  The U.S. had halted offensive arms sales three years ago amidst public outcry over
*  Saudi Arabia's role in the devastating war in Yemen.
*  U.S.-led peace talks between warring parties in Sudan are set to proceed in Geneva this
*  week, even as Sudanese officials say they have not yet agreed to send a delegation.
*  Sudan says the U.S. failed to ensure the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, first commit
*  to respecting an existing agreement, the Jeddah Declaration.
*  Sudan also objects to including the United Arab Emirates as an observer in the negotiations
*  as they accuse the UAE of supporting the RSF.
*  This comes amidst a spiraling humanitarian disaster in Sudan, where the U.N.'s declared
*  famine in a North Darfur camp and ongoing heavy flooding has led to even more displacement
*  and deaths.
*  In the Philippines, the independent news website, Rappler, has won an eight-year-long legal
*  will continue its operations after a court voided a shutdown order issued under former
*  President Rodrigo Duterte.
*  Rappler and its Nobel Peace Prize-winning co-founder, Maria Ressa, were consistently
*  persecuted by Duterte for their critical coverage of his authoritarian rule and his deadly
*  war on drugs.
*  Maria Ressa spoke after the court ruling.
*  This court decision, the latest in a string of court victories for Rappler, is a much-needed
*  reminder that the mission of journalism can thrive, even in the line of fire, to speak
*  truth to power, to hold the line, to build a better world.
*  The Wall Street Journal is reporting the Biden administration has been pushing to arrange
*  for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to leave office in exchange for amnesty for him
*  and other top Venezuelan officials.
*  The report comes two weeks after Venezuela held a contested election where both Maduro
*  and the opposition have claimed victory.
*  Peru has passed a bill that bars the prosecution of crimes against humanity committed before
*  2002.
*  If signed into law by President Dina Baluarte, it could benefit convicted former President
*  Alberto Fujimori and hundreds of others who carried out crimes during Peru's internal
*  conflict from 1980 to 2000.
*  The U.N. slammed the legislation, saying it, quote, "...risks endangering the rights to
*  justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence for thousands of victims of grave violations
*  in Peru."
*  In Brazil, authorities are investigating after a plane crash in Sao Paulo killed all 62 people
*  on board.
*  Among the dead were eight doctors who were headed to an oncology conference.
*  Another victim was a lawyer who represented clients in cases against airlines.
*  And a federal appeals court extended a block on the Biden administration's student debt
*  relief plan known as SAVE, which lowers monthly payments for millions and accelerates debt
*  cancellation for some borrowers who had taken out smaller loans before it was put on hold.
*  The SAVE program had already canceled $5.5 billion for over 400,000 borrowers.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
