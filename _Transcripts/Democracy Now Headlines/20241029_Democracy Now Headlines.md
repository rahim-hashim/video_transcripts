*  in Bethlehia.
*  Dozens of wounded people were rushed to the Kamel Adwan hospital, only to be denied care.
*  Just one doctor and a few exhausted medical workers remain at the hospital after Israeli
*  forces in recent days raided the facility, separated men and women, arrested much of

*  U.N. Human Rights Chief Oka Turk has called Israel's ongoing siege of northern Gaza
*  the darkest moment of the conflict.

*  Works Agency for Palestine from operating inside Israel and the occupied Palestinian
*  territories.
*  The U.N. agency, known as UNRWA, is tasked with providing food, health care and social
*  services to Palestinians as a critical lifeline to Gaza's surviving 2.3 million residents
*  who face widespread famine and malnutrition due to Israel's unrelenting year-long assault.
*  The ban on UNRWA was approved in a 92 to 10 vote with the full support of the Israeli
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling Likud party.
*  Israeli lawmaker Sharon Haskell co-authored the legislation.
*  If the United Nations is not willing to clean this organization from terrorism, from Hamas
*  activists, then we have to take measures to make sure that they cannot harm our people
*  ever again.
*  Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, called the bill's passage a dangerous precedent,
*  collective punishment and a violation of the U.N. charter and international law.
*  U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called it unacceptable and said the ban would have
*  devastating consequences for Palestinian refugees.
*  Its passage has increased support for a Palestinian Authority initiative to expel Israel from
*  the United Nations General Assembly.
*  Lebanon's health ministry says at least 60 people were killed as Israeli strikes pounded
*  the eastern Beqaa Valley, including the city of Baalbek.
*  At least two of the dead were children.
*  The killings bring the death toll from Israeli attacks on Lebanon to over 2,700.
*  Meanwhile, multiple Israeli airstrikes on Monday collapsed entire residential buildings
*  and sparked fires in the southern port city of Tyre.
*  A survivor said the attacks were aimed at civilians.
*  What do you expect us to do?
*  They fired at random.

*  and that the group's military structure remains intact.
*  South Africa Monday filed over 750 pages of evidence in its genocide case against Israel
*  at the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
*  South Africa says the documents lay out how Israel is, quote, promoting the destruction
*  of Palestinians living in Gaza, physically killing them with an assortment of destructive
*  weapons, depriving them access to humanitarian assistance, causing conditions of life which
*  are aimed at their physical destruction and using starvation as a weapon of war and to
*  further Israel's aims to depopulate Gaza through mass death and forced displacement
*  of Palestinians, unquote.
*  Over 30 countries and regional blocs are supporting South Africa's case at the International
*  Court of Justice.
*  In Jerusalem, hundreds of protesters rallied outside Israel's Knesset Monday to demand
*  a Gaza ceasefire deal in exchange of hostages.
*  Israeli police arrested nine of the protesters as they nonviolently blocked a road near the
*  residence of Prime Minister Netanyahu.
*  It's solidarity with the hostages.
*  We want our prime minister to make a deal, to cut a deal.
*  We want the war to stop.
*  We want the stop of killing and everything.

*  Israeli cultural institutions often working directly with the state have been crucial
*  in obfuscating, disguising and artwashing the dispossession and oppression of millions
*  of Palestinians for decades, unquote.
*  Donald Trump is appearing before supporters in Allentown, Pennsylvania today, as fallout
*  mounts over his racist Madison Square Garden rally, which included this now viral so-called
*  joke from the right-wing so-called comic Tony Hinchcliffe.
*  There's a lot going on.
*  Like, I don't know if you guys know this, but there's literally a floating island
*  of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now.

*  The FBI says it's investigating three separate but related arson attacks on ballot boxes
*  in the Pacific Northwest.

*  Police in Portland have identified a suspect vehicle in the case.
*  Oregon's secretary of state condemned the arson as, quote, an attack on our democracy,
*  unquote.
*  And the World Meteorological Association warned Monday the world is falling miles short on
*  action to stave off the worst impacts of climate change, with carbon dioxide concentrations
*  soaring to a record high of 420 parts per million last year.
*  The WMO says the last time the Earth's atmosphere held so much carbon dioxide was three to five
*  million years ago, when global temperatures were up to 4 degrees Celsius warmer and sea
*  levels were 10 to 20 meters higher.
*  Co Barrett is the WMO's deputy secretary general.
*  Co Barrett, WMO, WMO, WMO
*  Carbon dioxide is accumulating in the atmosphere faster than at any time experienced during
*  human existence.

*  to rising temperatures for many, many years to come.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
