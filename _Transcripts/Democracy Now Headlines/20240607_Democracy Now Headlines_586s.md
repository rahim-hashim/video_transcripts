*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel struck another U.N. school in Gaza, where displaced Palestinians had sought shelter.
*  Al Jazeera reports several people were killed in today's attack on the Unirwa school in
*  the Shati refugee camp west of Gaza City.
*  This comes a day after an Israeli strike on a U.N. school in the Nusrat refugee camp
*  killed at least 40 Palestinians.
*  Video footage has confirmed U.S. munitions were used in Thursday's strike.
*  The New York Times reports remnants of the Boeing-made GBU-39 bomb were uncovered.
*  Al Jazeera also published photographs of a missile fragment made by Honeywell.
*  The U.N. school had been turned into a shelter for displaced Palestinians.
*  At least 14 children were reportedly killed in Thursday's attack.
*  A number of other children were injured, including Imad Al-Makadme, who spoke to a reporter as
*  he lay on the floor of Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital in Dara Bala.
*  Why did they bomb us?
*  Why?
*  I want to know why.
*  Why?
*  We are all children in the school.
*  There are no armed people.
*  I don't know why they bombed it.
*  Where should we go?
*  Where?
*  Where should we go?
*  Here or there?
*  Israel claims Thursday's strike on the U.N. school targeted Hamas militants, but Israel's
*  presented no evidence to back up the claim.
*  In other news, the U.N.'s warning of a possible cholera outbreak in Gaza this summer due to
*  a severe lack of clean water.
*  In Washington, D.C., congressional leaders have confirmed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*  Netanyahu will address a joint session of Congress July 24th.
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, along with Senate Republican
*  Leader Mitch McConnell and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries joined together to
*  invite Netanyahu.
*  In a letter, they wrote, quote,
*  We invite you to share the Israeli government's vision for defending democracy, combating
*  terror and establishing a just and lasting peace in the region.
*  Unquote.
*  The invitation comes just weeks after the head prosecutor at the International Criminal
*  Court, Kareem Khan, announced he's seeking an arrest warrant for Netanyahu for committing
*  war crimes.
*  A number of lawmakers have vowed to boycott the speech, including Independent Senator
*  Bernie Sanders.
*  In related news, CNN is reporting the CIA has circulated a new assessment that concludes
*  Netanyahu will likely defy pressure from the Biden administration to end the war on Gaza
*  and set a postwar plan.
*  This comes as the Israeli military has announced it's signed a $3 billion deal with the United
*  States to buy 25 F-35 stealth fighter jets built by Lockheed Martin.
*  Israeli officials say the warplanes will be financed by U.S. military aid to Israel.
*  This comes despite growing calls for the U.S. to cut off arms sales to Israel.
*  On Thursday, the NAACP called on President Biden to draw a red line and halt arms shipments
*  citing the mounting death toll in Gaza, where over 36,700 Palestinians have been killed
*  in the past eight months.
*  This is NAACP CEO Derek Johnson.
*  We witnessed individuals in Gaza who are civilians being attacked, and they went to what was
*  supposed to be the safe zones.
*  These are things that are avoidable.
*  The United States must take a moral stand to protect civilian innocent children and
*  lives.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians and wounded at least
*  13 in a raid on the city of Jenin on Thursday.
*  The group Defense for Children International reports the dead included a 16-year-old named
*  Isanafis Musa Jalad, who sustained gunshot wounds to his leg, back and back of the head.
*  The Biden administration has announced it will send another $225 million in military
*  aid to Ukraine, including munitions that could be used to strike targets inside Russia.
*  Earlier today, President Biden met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris and
*  apologized for the months-long holdup in new U.S. assistance for Ukraine.
*  On Thursday, President Biden spoke about Ukraine during a speech in Normandy, France, to mark
*  the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when 150,000 Allied soldiers invaded France to drive out
*  the Nazis.
*  And make no mistake, the autocrats of the world are watching closely to see what happens
*  in Ukraine, to see if we let this illegal aggression go unchecked.
*  We cannot let that happen.
*  The surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable.
*  In related news, Russian President Vladimir Putin is threatening to send long-range missiles
*  to allies of Moscow that could be used against nations sending similar weapons to Ukraine.
*  We think that if someone thinks that it's possible to supply such weapons to a combat
*  zone to strike at our territory and create problems for us, why do we not have the right
*  to supply our weapons at the same class to those regions of the world where there will
*  be strikes on the sensitive facilities of those countries that are doing this against
*  Russia?
*  In a major legal victory for Donald Trump, an appeals court in Georgia has indefinitely
*  paused the election subversion conspiracy case against the former president.
*  The decision means the trial, if it even happens, will likely be delayed until after the election.
*  The appeals court put the case on hold as judges review a lower court's decision not
*  to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fannie Willis.
*  A federal judge has ordered former Trump adviser Steve Bannon to report to prison July 1 to
*  serve a four-month sentence for contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena
*  issued by the House January 6 Committee.
*  In Sudan, over 100 people, including dozens of children, were killed after rapid support
*  forces fighters stormed a village in the Al Jazeera state Wednesday, indiscriminately firing
*  at civilians.
*  Survivors of the massacre described the carnage saying over 40 armed RSF vehicles raided the
*  village of Wadalnu, unleashing heavy weaponry.
*  The RSF has claimed it was targeting the Sudanese army, but village residents say there's
*  no military presence in the region.
*  The U.N.'s condemned the attack, while the International Organization for Migration warns
*  the number of displaced people over the intensifying conflict in Sudan could soon reach 10 million.
*  This comes as the European Union is expected to impose sanctions on six members of the
*  Sudanese military and the RSF over accusations of war crimes as both sides fight for control
*  of Sudan's Darfur region.
*  In South Korea, thousands of workers at Samsung Electronics went on strike today for the first
*  time in the company's history.
*  Some 28,000 union members have joined the one-day action.
*  That's nearly a quarter of Samsung's entire workforce in South Korea.
*  They're demanding salary increases and bonuses as Samsung, which produces smartphones, electronics
*  and memory chips, has reported billions of dollars in profits.
*  This is Samsung Workers Union leader Son Woollimok.
*  We're approaching the fifth year since the labor union was founded, but the management
*  still refuses to recognize the union and continues to neglect it, ignoring the voices of the
*  employees or the labor union without any communication.
*  New York Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul is facing growing criticism after she abruptly
*  halted a plan to charge drivers $15 to enter parts of Manhattan.
*  Up until this week, Hochul had advocated for congestion pricing as a way to raise money
*  for public transit and to reduce car emissions in the city.
*  Climate advocate Bill McKibben described Hochul's abandonment of the program as one of the
*  most aggressive anti-environmental actions ever undertaken by a Democratic governor.
*  In media news, the Washington-based news outlet The Hill has fired Breonna Joy Gray, the co-host
*  of Rising, The Hill's daily morning show.
*  Gray has been a vocal critic of Israel's war on Gaza.
*  Last year, The Hill also fired the political commentator Katie Halper after she called Israel
*  an apartheid state.
*  The Columbia Law Review website is back online after its board of directors took down the
*  site Monday when student editors refused a request from the board to halt the publication
*  of an academic legal article written by Palestinian human rights lawyer Rabia Akhbariya titled
*  Toward Nakba as a Legal State.
*  But the controversy has not ended.
*  Student editors at the Law Review have voted to go on strike after the board added a disclaimer
*  statement about the Nakba article on the review's website.
*  Visit DemocracyNow.org to see our interview with Rabia Akhbariya.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
