# Top U.S. & World Headlines — November 19, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnytVoN9pmk)
*  AMY GOODMAN, The War and Peace Report.
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  We are broadcasting from Baku, Azerbaijan, from the UN Climate Summit.
*  In northern Gaza, at least 17 Palestinians were killed Monday when Israel's military
*  bombed a home near the hospital in Beit Lehiya.
*  The dead were members of the family of Dr. Hani Badran, one of the few remaining medical
*  workers at Kamal Adwan Hospital.
*  Video shows hospital director Dr. Hussam Abu Safiyah, who lost his own son to an Israeli
*  airstrike last month, comforting Dr. Badran after delivering the news.
*  The hospital has since come under fresh attacks by Israeli forces who shelled and fired on
*  the building, including right outside Dr. Abu Safiyah's office.
*  Dr. Abu Safiyah reports wounded patients are dying daily due to a severe lack of doctors
*  and medical supplies.
*  Elsewhere, an Israeli airstrike on a house in Gaza City Monday killed seven Palestinians
*  and wounded 10 others.
*  Survivors said the strike came without warning.
*  DR.
*  HADIB ABDEL-SHAHID, Palestinian Survivor We were at home having breakfast.
*  I went out and suddenly heard the sound of a bombing.
*  I returned back, thinking it was another house that was hit.
*  I saw the whole house was damaged.
*  I started searching and discovered all of the martyrs were kids.
*  All of those who were at home were elderly children and infants.
*  They were all women.
*  Who else would be there?
*  All of the men were at work.
*  We were recovering them in pieces.
*  On Monday, the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process warned the
*  Security Council that conditions in Gaza are, quote,
*  among the worst we've seen during the entire war and are not set to improve, unquote.
*  The warning came as Sri Lanka's U.N. ambassador delivered an annual report by the U.N. Special
*  Committee on Palestinian Human Rights.
*  DR.
*  ABDEL-SHAHID, Palestinian Survivor This year's report examines the mass civilian
*  casualties and life-threatening conditions intentionally imposed on Palestinians in Gaza.
*  Our findings conclude that Israel's methods of war align with the characteristics of Genocide.
*  AMY GOODMAN, The Washington Post In Lebanon, at least five people were
*  killed and 31 others wounded in an Israeli attack in a densely populated neighborhood
*  in central Beirut.
*  The airstrike tore through an apartment building near Lebanon's parliament and close to a
*  U.N. building in several embassies.
*  This is survivor Hussein Zahwa, whose family had fled earlier Israeli attacks on southern
*  Lebanon.
*  HUSSEIN ZAHWA, Survivor At the time of the explosion, there was a
*  lot of screaming, I mean, to the point that I could hear my little daughter, who was seven
*  years old, calling me, dad, dad, dad.
*  Because of the smoke, they could not breathe.
*  I don't know how I went up.
*  The gate that I was opening was on fire.
*  It was burning.
*  I don't know how I opened it.
*  I went up and pulled them from the rubble.
*  Thank God it went well.
*  AMY GOODMAN, The Washington Post Unicef warns two months of Israeli attacks
*  on Lebanon have killed more than 200 children and injured over 1,100.
*  UNICEF spokesperson James Elder warned nations not to remain silent in the face of what he
*  called the quote, normalization of horror in Lebanon.
*  Meanwhile, a rocket fire by Hezbollah from Lebanon injured at least six Israelis and
*  sparked a fire in Tel Aviv on Monday night.
*  In diplomatic news, U.S. Envoy Amos Hoxstein said a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon is
*  quote, now within our grasp, unquote, after meeting with Lebanon's parliament and caretaker,
*  Prime Minister Najib Makati, in Beirut today.
*  U.S. senators will vote Wednesday on whether the U.S. should halt $20 billion of arms sales
*  to Israel.
*  Senator Bernie Sanders introduced the joint resolutions of disapproval as the Biden
*  administration has continued to violate U.S. laws that prohibit the transfer of weapons to
*  governments committing human rights violations.
*  Six senators have publicly backed the resolutions thus far—Jeff Merkley, Brian Schatz,
*  Elizabeth Warren, Peter Welch, Chris Van Hollen and Bernie Sanders.
*  Meanwhile, the rights group Al Haq and Global Legal Action Network have taken the U.K.
*  government to court for continuing to supply F-35 fighter jet parts and other weapons to Israel,
*  despite saying it would suspend Israeli export licenses over international humanitarian law
*  violations.
*  The U.K. said it exempted F-35 parts from its arms suspension to avoid, quote,
*  undermining U.S. confidence in the U.K., unquote.
*  In related news, activists in Canada have blockaded the entrances to Collins Aerospace
*  in Oakville and Honeywell Aerospace in North Vancouver, both of which supply parts for
*  F-35 jets used by Israel to kill Palestinians.
*  Moscow says Ukraine fired six U.S.-supplied long-range missiles into Russia for the first
*  time today.
*  The Russian Ministry of Defense says Ukraine used the Army Tactical Missile System, known
*  as ATTACOMS, in the strike on Russia's Bryansk region.
*  This comes after President Biden gave Ukraine the green light to begin striking inside Russia,
*  and as Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree lowering the threshold for the use
*  of nuclear weapons.
*  The revised nuclear doctrine states any attack on Russia by a nation backed by a nuclear
*  power will be considered a joint attack on Russia.
*  It also allows for Russia's use of nuclear weapons in response to aggression against
*  allies, including Belarus.
*  On Monday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also signaled Britain will supply long-range
*  storm shadow cruise missiles to Ukraine for attacks on Russian soil.
*  Separately, a Russian missile attack on Ukraine's Black Sea port city of Odessa Monday killed
*  10 people and wounded 44.
*  Four children are among the wounded in the attack, which struck a residential neighborhood.
*  President-elect Trump has nominated Fox News personality Sean Duffy as secretary of transportation.
*  In the 1990s, Duffy starred in MTV reality TV shows including The Real World, Boston
*  and Road Rules.
*  Duffy served five terms as a Republican congressman representing northern Wisconsin until 2019
*  when he resigned from Congress.
*  In 2016, he authored the PROMESA Act, which created an unelected federally appointed control
*  board with sweeping powers to run Puerto Rico's economy.
*  Duffy has a 2 percent lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters.
*  He's previously blamed the sun rather than human activity for global heating and has
*  promoted what he called alternative science challenging the overwhelming scientific consensus
*  on the climate crisis.
*  Meanwhile, a lawyer representing two women who testified that Trump's nominee for
*  Attorney General Matt Gaetz paid them for sex has revealed new details about their
*  testimony to the House Ethics Committee.
*  The lawyer, Joel Leppard, on Monday told CNN one of his clients was an eyewitness to Gaetz
*  having sex with a minor.
*  Joel Leppard, Attorney General for the United States of America, Jr.
*  She was invited to a party in July of 2017.
*  She testified to the House that as she was walking out to the pool area, she turned to
*  her right and she witnessed her client, I'm sorry, her friend having sex with Representative
*  Gaetz and her friend at that time was 17.
*  Attorney Leppard has called on the House Ethics Committee to release its report on Gaetz,
*  who resigned from Congress last week, even as President Trump tapped him to lead the
*  Department of Justice.
*  So far, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has refused calls to release the report on
*  Gaetz.
*  Donald Trump confirmed Monday he plans to declare a national emergency and deploy the
*  military to enact mass deportations when he returns to office.
*  The ACLU has filed a lawsuit against immigration and customs enforcement seeking more information
*  on Trump's plans, including ICE's use of privately chartered flights.
*  The ACLU's director warned of an unprecedented attack on immigrants, writing,
*  As we ready litigation and create firewalls for freedom across blue states, we must also
*  sound the alarm that what's on the horizon will change the very nature of American life
*  for tens of millions of Americans.
*  The FBI is investigating what appears to be a new campaign of abusive text messages, this
*  time targeting Latinx and LGBTQ people.
*  Some recipients received messages telling them they were selected for deportation.
*  Other messages said recipients should report to a re-education camp.
*  This comes on the heels of a text message campaign targeting black people in the wake
*  of Trump's election victory, in which recipients were told to report to plantations for slavery.
*  On Capitol Hill, House Republicans are considering spending caps and new work requirements
*  for recipients of Medicaid, SNAP, nutrition assistance and other social programs.
*  That's according to the Washington Post, which reports the changes would impact at least 70
*  million low-income people.
*  The proposed cuts come after Trump promised to slash the corporate tax rate from 21 percent
*  to 15 percent, an annual tax cut worth $48 billion to the 100 largest U.S. corporations.
*  Here in Azerbaijan, the U.N. COP29 climate summit has entered its final stretch,
*  with negotiators from nearly 200 nations still far apart and a new climate finance commitment.
*  One major source of debate is a proposed U.N.-backed carbon market, which proponents say
*  could help offset an extra 5 billion metric tons of carbon emissions annually.
*  Opponents say carbon markets allow major polluters to greenwash their emissions while
*  devastating the environment and front-line communities.
*  This is Ariel Derangier, director of Indigenous Climate Action.
*  These carbon markets are literally putting our lands and territories up for land grabs
*  and to allow the sanctioning of multinational corporations to have a system to sort of simply
*  buy themselves out of continuing to pollute.
*  A recent study in Nature Communications looked at the use of carbon credits in more than 2,000
*  projects. It found less than 16 percent of carbon credits issued constituted real emission
*  reductions. After headlines, we'll have more on the COP29 U.N. climate summit here in Baku,
*  Azerbaijan, speaking with Colombia's environment minister, Susana Mohammed.
*  A Hong Kong court has sentenced 45 pro-democracy activists to up to 10 years in prison for their
*  involvement in an unofficial primary election in 2020. It was the largest trial yet under the
*  Beijing-imposed national security law. Among those convicted were prominent activists Benny Tai
*  and Joshua Wong. This is a pro-democracy activist Chen Poying, whose husband,
*  Liang Kwok-hung, received a sentence of nearly seven years.
*  Actually, the situation is quite clear. All these people are peaceful. They have always only called
*  for people to vote, which is the most peaceful and legal method. It's shocking that the court
*  has given such harsh sentences. And in New Zealand, 42,000 people gathered in front of
*  the parliament building in Wellington earlier today after taking part in a historic march to oppose a
*  bill that would roll back indigenous Maori rights established in the Treaty of Waitangi,
*  considered New Zealand's founding document. This is one of the protesters.
*  We just want to make sure that we're not giving away what was taken away from us, you know,
*  what's left of what we have in our culture and in our people, you know.
*  And those are some of the headlines. This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org,
*  The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman.
