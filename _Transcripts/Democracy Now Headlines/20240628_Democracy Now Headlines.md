# Top U.S. & World Headlines — June 28, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnjeHm8r5hw)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In the Gaza Strip, at least 11 Palestinians were killed and 40 others wounded today when
*  Israeli forces bombed Al-Mawasi, an area sheltering displaced families near Gaza's southern
*  city of Ra'afa.
*  Separately, Gaza's civil defense agency said three of its medics were killed and a
*  dozen others wounded by Israeli airstrikes as they searched for survivors of Israel's
*  assault on the Barrej refugee camp.
*  The attack on medical workers came as Israeli authorities continue to bar many Palestinians
*  from leaving Gaza to seek medical treatment.
*  This is Kamala Abu-Kuayq, mother to five-year-old Fayez, who urgently needs treatment for cancer
*  after lumps spread throughout his body.
*  On Thursday, the boy finally granted permission to leave Gaza for treatment in Egypt, but
*  his parents were not allowed to travel with him.
*  Why is there suffering like this?
*  Are people's hearts blind?
*  Are they blind or deaf that they don't hear or see?
*  Have they lost their feelings?
*  Is it OK for them to see us suffering like this?
*  Do they not feel for these children?
*  Malnourishment, lack of food, no capabilities, no treatments, no medication.
*  There's no milk.
*  There's nothing.
*  There's nothing.
*  Do they want to kill us slowly?
*  Why?
*  The Biden administration is defending the pace of its arms shipments to Israel after
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the U.S. of slow-rolling military assistance.
*  This week, the White House boasted it supplied Israel with $6.5 billion in military aid since
*  last October.
*  The disclosure came as senior U.S. officials held talks with an Israel delegation headed
*  by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant, who on Wednesday told reporters in Washington,
*  D.C., Israel is prepared to bomb Lebanon, quote, back to the Stone Age.
*  Unless, says Bala, halts cross-border attacks.
*  On Wednesday, Galant was confronted by a peace activist with code pink after meeting with
*  key members of Congress on Capitol Hill.
*  — Galant, you are a war criminal!
*  How dare you enter our city and our country?
*  You are a war criminal!
*  You have literally killed thousands of Palestinians carrying out the genocide in Palestine!
*  Shame on you!
*  And shame on you for letting them in here!
*  Shame on all of you for protecting a war criminal!
*  In more news from Capitol Hill, lawmakers have barred the U.S. State Department from
*  citing death toll figures provided by Gaza Ministry of Health ahead of Thursday's vote.
*  Congress's lone Palestinian-American lawmaker, Democrat Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, read into
*  the congressional record the toll of Palestinians killed during Israel's assault on Gaza, more
*  than 37,700 dead, 15,000 of them children.
*  But Palestinians are not just numbers.
*  Behind these numbers are real people, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, who have had their
*  lives stolen from them and their families torn apart.
*  And we should not be trying to hide it.
*  These are innocent children and babies who have been bombed in their tents, burned alive,
*  dismembered and deliberately starved to death.
*  Where is our shared humanity in this chamber?
*  There is so much anti-Palestinian racism in this chamber that my colleagues don't even
*  want to acknowledge that Palestinians exist at all, not when they're alive and now not
*  even when they're dead.
*  It's absolutely disgusting.
*  This is genocide denial.
*  President Biden and former President Trump took to the stage Thursday night for their
*  first debate of the 2024 election, hosted by CNN and its Atlanta headquarters over the
*  90-minute debate.
*  Trump repeatedly lied, referenced misinformation as he blasted Biden's immigration policies
*  and accurately linking asylum seekers and immigrants to rising crime.
*  Trump also falsely asserted Democrats have advocated for abortion legislation that would
*  allow doctors to kill newborn babies.
*  CNN moderators Jake Tapper and Dan Bash failed to challenge or fact-track Trump during the
*  debate.
*  President Biden was halting and disjointed, muffled his lines, often appeared to lose
*  his train of thought.
*  We'll play excerpts of the debate and get commentary for the rest of the broadcast after
*  headlines.
*  The United States Supreme Court has rejected a bankruptcy settlement that would have protected
*  members of the Sackler family from lawsuits related to the opioid epidemic.
*  In a 5-4 ruling, justices found the settlement between Purdue Pharma and states, tribes and
*  local governments violates U.S. bankruptcy law by exempting the Sacklers from future
*  litigation.
*  Meanwhile, the Supreme Court's right-wing supermajority ruled in a 6-3 decision that
*  the Securities and Exchange Commission cannot use administrative law judges to assign penalties
*  to violators who must instead be granted a jury trial.
*  The ruling sets a precedent that severely curtails the power of the federal government
*  to impose fines for violations across a range of agencies.
*  In a scathing dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the ruling a power grab that will have
*  momentous consequences.
*  She wrote, quote,
*  "...the constitutionality of hundreds of statutes may now be in peril, and dozens of
*  agencies could be stripped of their power to enforce laws enacted by Congress," she
*  said.
*  Also on Thursday, justices voted 5-4 to block the Environmental Protection Agency's Good
*  Neighbor Plan, which allows the EPA to regulate air pollution that drifts across state lines.
*  In a statement, Earth Justice wrote, quote,
*  The court's order puts thousands of lives at risk, forces downwind states to regulate
*  their industries more tightly and tells big polluters that it's open season on our environmental
*  laws, Earth Justice said.
*  In Texas, the former Uvalde School's police chief and another former officer have been
*  indicted over their role in the botched response to the 2022 massacre at Robb Elementary School.
*  Pete Arradondo, the former Uvalde School's police chief, and Adrian Gonzalez, a former
*  officer, were charged Thursday with multiple counts of felony child endangerment and abandonment.
*  Arradondo was fired three months after the mass shooting.
*  376 law enforcement officers responded to the mass shooting that day.
*  But it took 77 minutes, well over an hour, for anyone to enter the classroom where the
*  gunman was slaughtering children.
*  Nineteen children were killed, as well as two teachers.
*  Polls have opened in Iran, where voters will select a new president one month after Ibrahim
*  Raisi died in a helicopter crash.
*  There are four candidates on the ballot, all of them men qualified to run by Iran's Guardian
*  Council.
*  Some polls suggest voter turnout could be at a record low, below 50 percent, with voters
*  still reeling from violent crackdown and widespread anti-government protests in 2022.
*  The European Union has agreed to a long-term security agreement with Ukraine to provide
*  military, financial, diplomatic and humanitarian assistance.
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed the deal Thursday during a visit to Brussels,
*  where he met with European leaders Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen.
*  Zelensky's trip came one day after the European Union formally opened accession talks with
*  Ukraine and Moldova.
*  The process of joining the EU could take years or even decades.
*  Meanwhile, CNN's reporting the Biden administration is preparing to lift a de facto ban on Pentagon
*  contractors deploying to Ukraine that's been in place since Russia's 2022 invasion.
*  The policy shift would bring U.S. military personnel closer to a direct confrontation
*  with Russia while speeding the work of technicians who maintain and repair U.S.-provided weapons,
*  including F-16 fighter jets.
*  And the United States Pacific Fleet played host Thursday as the world's largest maritime
*  war games kicked off in Honolulu, Hawaii.
*  The Rim of the Pacific, or RIMPAC, International Maritime Exercise brings together 25,000 military
*  personnel from 29 countries, including Australia, Canada, South Korea, Japan, India, Brazil,
*  Chile, Mexico and seven European nations.
*  Israel will also be participating.
*  Israel's inclusion is further angered peace activists who say there's a direct connection
*  between Israel's assault on Gaza and the exploitation of Hawaiian lands by U.S. military.
*  Rose Elevitz is with Jewish Voice for Peace, Hawaii.
*  Palestine is a weapons testing ground for Israeli weapons that are exported throughout
*  the world to buyers like Japan, France, Brazil, Australia and more, all of whom are active
*  participants in this year's RIMPAC.
*  Like Gaza, Hawaii, too, is a testing ground for weapons and trainings.
*  The bombs that are tested in the sacred Makua Valley are the same bombs dropped in Gaza.
*  The white phosphorus responsible for choking and burning innocent Palestinians to death
*  is the same white phosphorus discharged in Makua.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
