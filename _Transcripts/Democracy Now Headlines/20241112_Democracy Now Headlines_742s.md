# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” November 12, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBuLc4SdVe0)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, War, Peace and the Presidency.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Dozens of Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip.
*  On Monday, at least 10 civilians were killed when a pair of Israeli missiles struck a crowded
*  tent cafe west of Qanyunis, an area Israel had designated as a so-called safe zone.
*  That followed Israeli attacks on the Nusadat refugee camp that killed 20 people, some of
*  whom were reportedly shot as they tried to flee the onslaught.
*  Meanwhile, Palestinian health workers say three medical staffers were injured in an
*  Israeli attack near the Besiege, Canal Adwan Hospital near Beit Lahiya.
*  It's been just over 400 days since Israel began its assault on Gaza.
*  For thousands of displaced Palestinians forced to live in makeshift camps, life has become
*  a daily struggle for survival.
*  The 400 days that have passed feel like 400 years, maybe even more.
*  If there was no war, we wouldn't have known such hunger and displacement.
*  Before we were living decently.
*  We were fine and happy, receiving aid packages twice a month.
*  Now there is no food, no water, no medicine.
*  There's nothing.
*  We are deprived of everything, even the air we breathe.
*  Israel's failed to meet a 30-day deadline set by the Biden administration to end its
*  starvation campaign in northern Gaza, where the U.N. says a famine is imminent.
*  Despite the deadline, the Biden administration still has not triggered U.S. laws requiring
*  it withhold military support for Israel over gross human rights abuses.
*  In a report co-signed by Oxfam, Refugees International and Save the Children relief groups write
*  that Israel entirely failed to meet 15 of 19 U.S. demands, warning the situation in
*  northern Gaza is, quote,
*  in an even more dire state today than a month ago, unquote.
*  Israel's military's bomb Beirut's southern suburb of Harat Rik, after warning residents
*  to flee the area.
*  Today's attacks came after Lebanese officials reported one person was killed and four injured
*  after an Israeli airstrike targeted the town of Hermel in the eastern Baalbek Hermel government.
*  On Monday, Israel's newly appointed defense minister Israel Katz ruled out even a temporary
*  peace deal, declaring, quote,
*  there will be no ceasefire and no pause, unquote.
*  Israel's far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrych told Israeli lawmakers he's ordered
*  work to begin so that Israel connects the occupied West Bank.
*  The year 2025 will be, with God's help, the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria.
*  Smotrych, who's himself a resident of an illegal Israeli settlement in the West Bank,
*  said he hopes the incoming Trump administration will back his plans, which violate international
*  law.
*  Here in the United States, decision desk HQ is projecting Republicans will retain control
*  of the House of Representatives, cementing their party's control of both houses of
*  Congress and all three branches of government.
*  Other major news organizations have not yet called the House contest for either party.
*  On Monday, Democrats flipped a congressional seat in Louisiana, where State Senator Cleo
*  Rubio-Fields won the recently redrawn 6th congressional district, which is Louisiana's
*  second majority black district.
*  That district is under review by the U.S. Supreme Court, which said a day before the
*  election it'll review a lower court ruling striking down Louisiana's new congressional
*  district map.
*  President-elect Donald Trump will nominate Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio as
*  secretary of state, according to multiple news outlets.
*  Rubio is the son of Cuban immigrants who's fought to maintain the U.S. embargo on Cuba.
*  He's a staunch supporter of Israel's assault on Gaza, called for the, quote,
*  complete eradication of Hamas, unquote.
*  Rubio's also called for U.S. military action against Iran.
*  If Rubio is confirmed as secretary of state, Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis will
*  name a temporary replacement to fill his Senate seat until a 2026 special election.
*  Trump has chosen New York Republican Congressmember Lisa Fannik to serve as his ambassador to
*  the United Nations.
*  She's a Trump loyalist, the only woman in the House Republican leadership.
*  She recently joined congressional hearings over free speech and support for Palestinian
*  rights on campus, where her grilling of two Ivy League presidents over allegations of
*  campus anti-Semitism led to their resignations.
*  President-elect Trump has nominated South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as secretary of
*  Homeland Security.
*  Noem supports new oil and gas developments on federal lands, has refused federal funding
*  for energy efficiency and environmental programs, and infamously sent the South Dakota National
*  Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border.
*  Last year, she signed legislation banning gender-affirming treatment for young South
*  Dakotans.
*  Trump has selected Florida Congressmember Mike Walz to serve as national security adviser.
*  He's a former Green Beret and active colonel in the U.S. Army National Guard, who served
*  multiple tours in Afghanistan.
*  Walz, known as a foreign policy hawk on China and Iran, and supported Trump's efforts
*  to overturn the 2020 election.
*  Walz regularly appears as a pundit on Fox News and has attacked the U.S. military for
*  teaching critical race theory to officers.
*  Former Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie will lead Trump's transition efforts
*  for the Pentagon.
*  In 2020, a whistleblower's report found then-Secretary Wilkie discredited and smeared
*  a house aide who reported a sexual assault at work.
*  Despite calls he resigned by 20 veterans groups and more than two dozen Democratic lawmakers,
*  Wilkie only left office after Trump's first term expired and after the Orlando Sentinel
*  revoked its endorsement of Wilkie.
*  Trump has named Stephen Miller as White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy.
*  Miller's The Architect of Trump's Zero-Tolerance Immigration Policies, including family separations,
*  has a well-documented history of promoting white nationalist theories.
*  Miller co-authored President Trump's 2017 inaugural address, which painted a dark picture
*  of American carnage.
*  Just ahead of the election, Miller declared at a Madison Square Garden rally for Trump,
*  quote,
*  Trump has nominated former Congressmember
*  Lee Zeldin to head the Environmental Protection Agency.
*  The Long Island Republicans served four terms in the House of Representatives, where he
*  earned a score of just 14 out of 100 from the League of Conservation Voters after consistently
*  voting against critical environmental protections and clean energy job investments.
*  Zeldin's nomination came after The New York Times reported Trump's transition team is
*  discussing moving EPA headquarters outside Washington, D.C.
*  Nate James of the American Federation of Government Employees told Politico many career EPA members
*  would leave the agency if it moves, adding, quote,
*  Donald Trump still hasn't signed an ethics agreement required for presidential transition
*  teams.
*  On Monday, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote, quote,
*  This is what illegal corruption looks like, Warren said.
*  Meanwhile, congressional Republicans have proposed legislation to grant Trump sweeping
*  powers to crush his political enemies.
*  The so-called Stop Terror Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act would give
*  the Treasury Department unilateral authority to revoke the tax-exempt status of any nonprofit
*  deemed to be a terrorist-supporting organization, unquote.
*  Haiti shut down its Port-au-Prince airport after gangs opened fire at Landing Plains
*  Monday.
*  A flight attendant aboard a Spirit Airlines aircraft was struck and suffered minor injuries.
*  A JetBlue plane was also hit.
*  Spirit, JetBlue and American Airlines have temporarily suspended flights to and from
*  Haiti.
*  A new interim prime minister businessman, Alex Didier Fils-Aime, was sworn in Monday
*  after Haiti's transitional council ousted his predecessor, Gary Conneal.
*  Fils-Aime, a son of a prominent activist, vowed to restore security in Haiti and usher
*  in long-awaited elections for a new president.
*  We are reminding all Haitians, men and women, from the country within and from abroad, business
*  people, big and small.
*  The duty of the government is to organize elections that will not be contested.
*  Everybody has to help.
*  The U.N. Human Rights Office said nearly 4,000 people have been killed and another 1,800
*  injured in Haiti this year due to gang violence.
*  Back in the United States, wildfires are raging on both the West and East Coast, as recent
*  data shows all but two states are facing historic drought conditions.
*  An 18-year-old firefighter, Darrell Vasquez, died Saturday while battling the Jennings
*  Creek fire in New York and New Jersey.
*  Air quality alerts were issued in New York City over the weekend as smoke and haze from
*  multiple fires filled the skies, including a brush fire in Brooklyn's Prospect Park.
*  Fire crews have also been battling flames in Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Massachusetts.
*  U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned the clock is ticking as he took the stage
*  earlier today at the COP29 climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan.
*  This is almost certain to be the hottest year on record and the master class in climate
*  destruction.
*  Families running for their lives before the next hurricane strikes, biodiversity destroyed
*  in sweltering seas, workers and pilgrims collapsing in insufferable heat, floods tearing
*  through communities and tearing down infrastructure, children going to bed hungry as droughts ravage
*  crops.
*  And all these disasters and more are being supercharged by human-made climate change.
*  And no country is spared.
*  As talks get underway at COP29, activists at the summit held a silent protest Monday
*  after organizers barred them from chanting or making speeches on the streets outside
*  the conference halls.
*  After taking part in the protest, Filipino climate activist Liddy Nakhpil addressed the
*  challenges of the incoming U.S. administration.
*  The U.S. is more of a problem than helping in any solution.
*  This is going to get worse under Trump.
*  We've seen it in his first presidency.
*  So I think the rest of the world needs to step up even more if we're going to have
*  this very uncooperative United States.
*  Democracy Now! will be broadcasting live from the U.N. climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan,
*  all next week.
*  And a Dutch court dealt a devastating blow to climate activists today as it ruled in
*  favor of Shell, which had appealed a landmark decision that forced the oil company to cut
*  its carbon emissions by 45 percent by 2030.
*  The U.S. has vowed to continue their fight to protect the planet.
*  This is Donald Poles, director of Friends of the Earth Netherlands, one of the groups
*  which brought the case against Shell.
*  It's too early to announce new steps.
*  We're going to take the time to read the court judgment.
*  But it's clear in the summary that the judge stated that the more than 800 oil and gas
*  projects that are planned by Shell, that they are contradictory to the responsibility of
*  CO2 emissions in accordance with international climate agreements and contributes to human
*  rights violations.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, War, Peace and the Presidency.
