We speak with acclaimed director Ryan Coogler about his latest film Sinners, which is set to be one of the biggest box office hits of the year. Starring Michael B. Jordan, the genre-bending horror film is set in the Mississippi Delta during Jim Crow and is a “cinematic gumbo” of various influences and themes, Coogler tells Democracy Now!

“I wanted to make a film that was kind of raging against the concept of genre and making the audience constantly question it, even while they were watching it,” he says. In particular, the film celebrates Delta blues, music made by Black artists “living under a back-breaking form of American apartheid,” and what Coogler describes as “our country’s most important contribution to global popular culture.”

Coogler also discusses his family connection to Mississippi, producing the film with his wife Zinzi Coogler, his highly publicized contract with Warner Bros. and more. Coogler’s previous films include Black Panther, Creed and Fruitvale Station.

*  than a decade ago. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=196.5s)]
*  This is an astounding film. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=198.04s)]
*  Thank you, Amy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=201.1s)]
*  It's good to see you as well. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=203.1s)]
*  And I appreciate the kind words about it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=205.06s)]
*  We worked really hard on it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=207.1s)]
*  Me and my wife is Ainsley Coogler, our partner Sevak Ohanian, and all of us at Proximity [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=209.02s)]
*  Media. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=215.02s)]
*  We, you know, this film meant everything to us. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=216.02s)]
*  And it's been a joy to share it with the world and to have time to talk about it with [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=220.02s)]
*  people like you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=225.02s)]
*  Well, talk about how you developed the idea for this and wrote it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=226.02s)]
*  Horror film, this film about everything from Jim Crow to slavery, the magnificent music, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=233.02s)]
*  and the fact that you made it a vampire film. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=242.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=245.02s)]
*  I mean, it's such a great group of questions. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=246.02s)]
*  You know, I'd like to be honest with you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=253.02s)]
*  My family is like many families in California. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=255.02s)]
*  We probably are the second wave of the great migration, meaning that, you know, before [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=259.02s)]
*  California, my family was in the South, in the Gulf States primarily, but also some of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=264.02s)]
*  them were in Mississippi. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=269.02s)]
*  And it's ironic because my grandmother and her mom before her and my mom are known for [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=271.02s)]
*  is their gumbo. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=279.02s)]
*  They cook a style of gumbo that comes from Port Arthur, Texas. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=281.02s)]
*  And as you know, that the dish is probably most famous in Louisiana, but it's combining [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=284.02s)]
*  a lot of different elements into one uniform dish that's beloved. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=290.02s)]
*  My family is known for making some of the best gumbo. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=295.02s)]
*  And this was my opportunity to make some cinematic gumbo. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=298.02s)]
*  You know, I took some things that might seem disparate, you know, in a description, but [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=302.02s)]
*  I think they go very well together. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=307.02s)]
*  You know, I grew up in Oakland, and one of the most important people in my life was my [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=309.02s)]
*  Uncle James Edmondson, who was a Mississippi man who married my grandmother's younger [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=314.02s)]
*  sister, Sammy, who the main character in the film is named after. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=318.02s)]
*  But for a considerable amount of time, he was the oldest male member of my family, and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=322.02s)]
*  I just really loved spending time with him. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=329.02s)]
*  And all he wanted to do when he was off from work was listen to blues music, drink old [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=331.02s)]
*  Taylor whiskey, and maybe catch a game of San Francisco Giants on the radio. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=336.02s)]
*  You know, and I associated that music with him. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=341.02s)]
*  You know, I never felt like it belonged to me. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=344.02s)]
*  It felt like it was music for older people. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=346.02s)]
*  But he passed away in 2015, and I was devastated. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=349.02s)]
*  I was away from home, as I normally was, making a film called Creed when I got the news. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=353.02s)]
*  And after he passed, I started to listen to old blues records to kind of remind myself [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=360.02s)]
*  of him. And if I did it enough, I would feel like he was there with me, almost like I was [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=365.02s)]
*  conjuring his spirit. And the base of the idea started with that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=369.02s)]
*  And when I started to do my research on blues music, specifically the Delta blues music [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=373.02s)]
*  that came out of that Mississippi Delta, I discovered that, you know, there's a firm [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=378.02s)]
*  argument to be made that this art form, the Delta blues, is our country's most important [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=383.02s)]
*  contribution to global popular culture. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=390.02s)]
*  You know, I think it's probably our most important artistic contribution to the world. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=393.02s)]
*  And it was such a profound discovery that, you know, this music made by people who were, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=396.02s)]
*  you know, for all intents and purposes, living under a backbreaking form of American apartheid, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=404.02s)]
*  you know, denied that humanity on a daily basis would create something so artistically [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=409.02s)]
*  excellent that it would affect global culture from that time forward. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=417.02s)]
*  And that was what I saw it to make. I saw it to make something personal and true, but also [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=423.02s)]
*  epic and mythical. You know, I grew up loving horror stories in literature and in cinema. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=429.02s)]
*  You know, so I combined that as well. You know, I had an appetite for showing more of myself, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=435.02s)]
*  you know, after having over a decade working in franchise filmmaking, you know, if that makes [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=442.02s)]
*  sense. I was very passionate about those projects, but those projects weren't completely my [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=449.02s)]
*  own. So I was excited to incorporate some elements of genres and styles that I was interested [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=454.02s)]
*  in. But also, the last thing I'll tell you, Amy, was through my research into the music, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=461.02s)]
*  I learned more about the music industry and the music business as it was built out and how [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=467.02s)]
*  much the concept of genre is related to racism. You know, the classification of different [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=471.02s)]
*  types of music. You have a song sung by a black artist and a white artist can sing that [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=479.02s)]
*  same song in homage to that artist. And the industry would say, hey, this black person's [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=485.02s)]
*  song, we're going to put that in one category. Back then, it might have been called Race [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=491.02s)]
*  Records. And then this other white musician will invent a new genre to keep a separation [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=494.02s)]
*  here of these groups of people. Maybe we'll call that Bluegrass or we'll call it Country [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=500.02s)]
*  or we'll call it Rock and Roll. You know, even though it was the same song sung the same [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=504.02s)]
*  way, they were looking at the color of the skin of the person who was singing it and [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=508.02s)]
*  enforcing that apartheid even through the artistic business model. So I wanted to make [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=513.02s)]
*  a film that was kind of raging against the concept of genre and making the audience constantly [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=519.02s)]
*  question it, even while they were watching it, whether that's genres of music or genres [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=524.02s)]
*  of filmmaking. This film is definitely genre bending, genre shattering, crosses so many [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=528.02s)]
*  genres. And again, it's about vampires. So before we go to this clip, can you set it [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=535.02s)]
*  up for us? Yeah, absolutely. So this is a clip with a character named Cornbread, who's [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=541.02s)]
*  played by the great Omar Ben-Shim Miller. And he was kind of hired to be the balancer [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=547.02s)]
*  for the for the for the juke joint. And he's gone for a little bit. He goes to use the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=552.02s)]
*  restroom and he comes back. And since he's been gone, the character Smoke, who's one [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=556.02s)]
*  of the twins, is actually the older twin played by Michael B. Jordan and the character [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=561.02s)]
*  Delta Slim played by Del Rey Lindo and the character Annie played by Wumi Masako. They've [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=567.02s)]
*  all had a supernatural encounter that's kind of raised it raised their antennas to the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=573.02s)]
*  fact that something is going on that might be greater than they can understand. And Wumi [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=579.02s)]
*  is a conjure woman who has a lot of experience, you know, with with who do and mysticism. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=585.02s)]
*  And she's trying to, you know, you know, lean on that knowledge to figure out exactly what [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=591.02s)]
*  they're dealing with. And a light bulb goes off when when this character is struggling [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=595.02s)]
*  to enter the space. Here's a clip from centers. What y'all doing? Just step aside and let [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=600.02s)]
*  me own in now. Why you need him to do that? You begin strong enough to push past us? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=609.02s)]
*  Well, that wouldn't be too polite now, would it, Miss Annie? I don't know why I'm talking [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=617.02s)]
*  to you anyway. Don't talk to him. You're talking to me right now. Why you can't just walk [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=623.02s)]
*  your big ass up in here without an invite, huh? Go ahead. Admit to it. Admit to what? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=628.02s)]
*  That you did. You listen to this. Now, now we out here playing games, telling ghost [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=637.02s)]
*  stories in place of doing what we ought to do. What is it we supposed to be doing? Being [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=647.02s)]
*  kind to one another and being polite. Now, we is one people and we shouldn't go in barging [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=656.02s)]
*  into other folks' places uninvited, so. We been in and out of here all day. Ain't never [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=664.02s)]
*  need an invite then. Yeah, something ain't adding up. Can I at least get my money? Careful. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=673.02s)]
*  Yep, it's scary. Sinners. We're talking to the acclaimed filmmaker, the writer of [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=694.02s)]
*  Sinners that just opened around the world. In fact, Ryan, you've just come back from [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=709.02s)]
*  London, right? I mean, I'm wondering, vampires, what it means to different cultures and what [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=713.02s)]
*  vampires mean to you. That's a great question. I think that the vampire is one of those [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=721.02s)]
*  supernatural creatures that is kind of at the top tier of global consciousness. And [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=734.02s)]
*  I think that's because you've seen the concept of the vampire pop up in different [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=742.02s)]
*  cultures almost independent of each other. Every place where you'll find human beings [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=748.02s)]
*  has a version of this creature. But it's also permeated two of the most widely spread [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=754.02s)]
*  storytelling art forms, literature with Dracula and all the books that have come after that, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=763.02s)]
*  and also cinema with Dracula and his adaptations and all the shows and films that have come [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=769.02s)]
*  after that. You've just got some great, great, great cinema that involves this mythical [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=777.02s)]
*  character. And for me, what I think makes vampires so exciting is that they are very [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=783.02s)]
*  associated with human behavior. They're associated with seduction and lust and material [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=791.02s)]
*  gain, the taboo. And I think that vampires are like zombies and werewolves, which are [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=804.02s)]
*  the other big aliens, which are the other big ones. They maintain generally a large [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=816.02s)]
*  degree of their humanity, which makes them more frightening, I think, but also more alluring. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=826.02s)]
*  And it's just rich material. And one of my favorite stories I ever read is a book by [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=833.02s)]
*  Stephen King called On Writing. And I read this book back in 2015 when I was working [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=843.02s)]
*  on Creed. And ironically, it was the same year my uncle passed away. And I remember [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=851.02s)]
*  talking about his process, and he had an aside about a book he wrote called Salem's [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=857.02s)]
*  Lot. And it was so interesting where he talked about being inspired to write a movie about [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=863.02s)]
*  Dracula, but have him somewhere in America, you know. And he pitched his wife, Tabitha, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=870.02s)]
*  what if I wrote a book about Dracula showing up in New York City? And she very famously [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=878.02s)]
*  said, according to the book, yeah, he would just get run over by a cab, you know, like [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=883.02s)]
*  the city was too big, it was too complicated for Dracula to even survive crossing the street. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=888.02s)]
*  And allegedly, Stephen King thought about that and took the note from his wife and then [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=894.02s)]
*  said, well, what if he arrived in a small town, you know, a sleepy American town that was [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=899.02s)]
*  kind of isolated? And then she kind of said, hey, maybe you got something there. And that [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=903.02s)]
*  became Salem's Lot. And I remember rushing off to read that book and being so moved by [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=907.02s)]
*  it, you know, and his conversation around it in writing was that it was basically a [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=912.02s)]
*  combination of a book called Peyton's Place and Dracula, you know. And I just loved the [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=916.02s)]
*  book, and I always wanted to make something that felt like it, you know. So I took that [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=922.02s)]
*  opportunity here on this movie. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=927.02s)]
*  And talk about what it was like for you going into the deep south to make this film. I mean, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=929.02s)]
*  you made the film around New Orleans, is that right? And the culture there and your [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=936.02s)]
*  past work, whether, and your journeys to Africa with Zinzi, your wife. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=943.02s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. So this movie was a very interesting opportunity for me to do some [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=950.02s)]
*  research about my lineage. And I had that opportunity before with the Panther films. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=958.02s)]
*  And in that situation, you know, me being a foundational black American, you know, my [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=965.02s)]
*  family has been here, you know, for over 400 years, essentially, you know, in North America. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=973.02s)]
*  But, you know, the Panther films allowed me to travel back to the continent of Africa [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=980.02s)]
*  and spend time there and, you know, and contemplate our disney ancestry as it relates to the [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=985.02s)]
*  continent, as it relates to the diaspora. This movie afforded me the opportunity to [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=991.02s)]
*  go back to my more recent lineage, you know, 100 years or so, you know, and go back to, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=995.02s)]
*  you know, Mississippi, a state that I had never been to. You know, I'm almost 40 years [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1002.02s)]
*  old, and my metrolineal grandfather was born in Mississippi. You know, my uncle, who was [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1007.02s)]
*  so important to my life, was there until he was a young man, and I had never been. And [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1013.02s)]
*  it was a beautiful experience to go on that blues trail and spend time in those places. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1018.02s)]
*  But it also was a harrowing experience at the same time. I went to the Dockery Plantation [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1024.02s)]
*  in the Mississippi Delta, which is, you know, thought to be, you know, maybe the place where [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1031.02s)]
*  the first true Delta blues song was played by a man called Charlie Patton. And when you [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1037.02s)]
*  go, you know, you realize that they were making this music in slave quarters, you [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1044.02s)]
*  know, and it was just this immense wealth that was owned by this plantation, like the [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1048.02s)]
*  amount of fertile land that you would see, the amount of crops that you would see, you [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1055.02s)]
*  know, and that it was also a place where most people, you know, were denied access to these [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1060.02s)]
*  resources. They were back-breakingly poor, you know, and then at that time, you know, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1066.02s)]
*  often these people, these were enslaved people, you know, who weren't being paid anything, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1071.02s)]
*  you know. So for me, to know that my family had history there and I was touching down [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1076.02s)]
*  in that place for the first time, it was a level of guilt there for me, but there was [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1084.02s)]
*  also a level of wonder to know what my recent ancestors endured, you know what I mean, and [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1088.02s)]
*  were able to survive and were able to make plans and affirm their humanity and affect [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1096.02s)]
*  the world, you know, with their culture. You know, I was really taken aback by it. And [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1103.02s)]
*  while I was there, I was there with my composer, Louis Urenson, who made our incredible score, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1108.02s)]
*  our incredible soundtrack. You know, I'd encourage folks to go out and go to the streaming [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1113.02s)]
*  platforms and listen to some of this great music that he made. You know, he was born [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1118.02s)]
*  and raised in Linchuping, Sweden, you know, thousands of miles away from the United States. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1122.02s)]
*  But his father, you know, due to the fact that these black musicians weren't allowed [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1127.02s)]
*  to tour in the U.S., some of the British musicians who loved their music took them to Europe [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1133.02s)]
*  to tour, you know. And Sweden was one of the places that they played, where Louis' father [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1138.02s)]
*  saw these players, Holland Wolf, Albert King, you know, as a teenager in Sweden, it was [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1143.02s)]
*  so inspired by their music that he became a blues guitarist who then taught his son [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1150.02s)]
*  how to play. His son would end up being Louis and become, you know, my good friend and the [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1155.02s)]
*  composer on all of my movies. You know, Louis was there with me on a blues trail, and his [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1161.02s)]
*  father was there with him. It was a lifelong dream for his father to take this trip with [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1166.02s)]
*  him. So Louis, you know, through researching this movie, was fulfilling, you know, his [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1171.02s)]
*  70-year-old father's dream, you know, to see the birthplace of this music that changes [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1175.02s)]
*  life so much. You know, and that, you know, enabled me to understand, like, just like [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1181.02s)]
*  the global impact that these incredible human beings who, due to the shame and the misinformation [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1186.02s)]
*  associated with the time that they came up in and the exploitation that was happening [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1194.02s)]
*  and the indignities that were happening, you know, we don't look at that time enough, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1198.02s)]
*  you know. So I took the opportunity to do so very seriously. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1202.02s)]
*  So what's it like working with your wife? I mean, you credit her with so much. You co-produced [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1207.02s)]
*  the film with her. What's it like working with Zinzi on this masterpiece? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1213.02s)]
*  I mean, it's great, man. Zinzi is my favorite person in the world. You know, I've been [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1219.02s)]
*  around her a long time, and still somehow it feels like it's not long enough, you know. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1226.02s)]
*  And, you know, she knows me really well. We're very different, you know, which is very helpful. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1233.02s)]
*  We got two different communication styles, two different ways of seeing the world. So [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1241.02s)]
*  in general, if I have a situation that I can't crack, you know, because she comes at things [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1247.02s)]
*  with a different angle, normally she can crack it very easily, you know. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1253.02s)]
*  You know, I remember first meeting you in Zinzi back in 2013, now at the big premiere [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1256.02s)]
*  in New York. There she was. There she is, pregnant with your second child, the two of [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1263.02s)]
*  your second child. This was 5.30 in the morning. It was at the Sundance Film Festival. You [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1270.02s)]
*  had just introduced Fruitvale. I said, Would you be willing to come in at 5.30 because [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1279.02s)]
*  the show is at 6? You said, Yep, I'm there. You said because your uncle, Clarence Thomas, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1283.02s)]
*  not the Justice, but the Secretary General of the International Longshore and Warehouse [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1288.02s)]
*  Union, had been on the show, loved it. And I said to you, Can you give a message to him? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1293.02s)]
*  You looked directly into the camera and you said, Hi, Uncle Bud. But having said that, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1299.02s)]
*  I wanted to go to the second part of that conversation. As you talked at that point, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1305.02s)]
*  I think you were working at the San Francisco, what, the Juvenile Detention Center? You just [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1310.02s)]
*  come out with Fruitvale? Yeah, the Youth Guidance Center, yep. So let's go to that clip. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1316.02s)]
*  I've never been homeless in my life. I always had a home. When I first went to film school, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1323.02s)]
*  however, because it was such a sporadic day, I went down to Los Angeles, you know, and [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1329.02s)]
*  I didn't have anywhere to stay yet. So I kind of had to jump start in classes and things [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1334.02s)]
*  like that. So for a few, I would say for about a week and a half, you know what I mean? I [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1338.02s)]
*  was getting dressed in my car, spending most of my time in school until I found a place. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1343.02s)]
*  But I bumped around quite a bit. I stayed with some Jesuits, you know what I mean, with a [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1349.02s)]
*  group of Jesuits that were in training basically. I stayed with a distant relative for a day [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1354.02s)]
*  or two. But I found my car to kind of be a safe haven for a little bit, you know, before [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1361.02s)]
*  I got an apartment. So Ryan, that's you back in 2013 telling your life story. You had just [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1366.02s)]
*  done Fruitvale, first time working with, as you have from then on, with Michael B. Jordan. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1375.02s)]
*  I don't think most people know that part of your life, what that meant. Yeah, it happened [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1381.02s)]
*  very fast for me in terms of like the decision to go to Los Angeles and become a filmmaker, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1390.02s)]
*  you know. And I went down there without everything figured out, you know, and I needed, I ended [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1401.02s)]
*  up needing a lot of support from a lot of different people. And I'm still close with all of those [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1410.02s)]
*  people. I'm a product of so much support that's been poured into me, you know, from [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1415.02s)]
*  likely sources but also very unlikely sources. Is it true that Zinzi made your dream possible [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1422.02s)]
*  by paying $300 for your first movie writing software when you couldn't afford it? Yeah, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1429.02s)]
*  that's very true. That's very true. Yeah, yeah, she, yeah, Zinzi did buy me Final Draft, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1437.02s)]
*  one of the kindest things anybody's ever done for me. And yeah, we were both student [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1442.02s)]
*  athletes. You know, we would buy each other things all the time, man, you know, like, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1450.02s)]
*  but it was often, it was rarely something as forward thinking as that, you know, which [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1454.02s)]
*  kind of just speaks to who she is, man. And she does things like that all the time, like, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1462.02s)]
*  she's an incredible gift giver. I wanted to play that clip from 2013. It's not so [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1468.02s)]
*  long ago. It's a dozen years ago. And talk about what you negotiated in making Sinners, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1475.02s)]
*  the arrangement you had with Warner Brothers. The New York Times reports, Warner Brothers [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1483.02s)]
*  agreed to spend $90 million to make Sinners and agreed to give you a cut of gross ticket [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1489.02s)]
*  sales. Now rare arrangement known as first dollar gross, meaning before they recoup their [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1495.02s)]
*  costs, you're getting money as well. Warner also agreed, and this is absolutely key, to [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1502.02s)]
*  relinquish its ownership of the film to you after 25 years. The Times reports, quote, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1508.02s)]
*  some rival film companies were horrified that Warner Brothers would give a film away even [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1515.02s)]
*  after a period of time. Talk about these key components of your contract and why this [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1521.02s)]
*  was so critical for you, Ryan Coogler. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1528.02s)]
*  That's a great question. I mean, what I will do is I'll maybe add some context that [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1531.02s)]
*  maybe those articles didn't add. I'm not the first filmmaker to get any of these deals. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1537.02s)]
*  You know, and Warner Brothers is not the first studio to provide these deals to a [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1544.02s)]
*  filmmaker. You know, so like I think that a lot has been made of my deal in particular. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1550.02s)]
*  I'm not totally sure why. You know, like I have my guesses, you know, but I've been [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1561.02s)]
*  in the industry long enough to know what kind of deals are possible, and nothing about [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1571.02s)]
*  this deal is a new thing, you know. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1575.02s)]
*  What's your guess, Ryan? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1579.02s)]
*  It is not a con—I'd rather not say. But you know, like the attention on what's [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1580.02s)]
*  happening with this project, you know, outside of it as a piece of art and as a piece of [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1596.02s)]
*  commerce has been very interesting. You know, but for me, you know, this film was very important [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1604.02s)]
*  to me. As a writer, director, I've made over $2 billion at the global box office. I'm not [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1613.02s)]
*  yet 40 years old. It's taken a lot of time, commitment, energy, and I've missed out on a [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1621.02s)]
*  lot of things in my life. Making films that will always be owned by other people for this [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1631.02s)]
*  one because it was so personal and because I had the ability to negotiate, you know, I [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1639.02s)]
*  asked for a few things that were very important to me for this project, you know, for what it [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1648.02s)]
*  was about and what it meant to me and my family. And thankfully, you know, I was able to get [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1652.02s)]
*  those things I was asking for from Warner Brothers. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1658.02s)]
*  Well, Ryan, I know you have to go, but reading from The Guardian, you're widely considered [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1661.02s)]
*  the highest-grossing black director in history. Your film Black Panther became the highest-grossing [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1666.02s)]
*  film of all time, directed by an African-American director, grossing over $1.3 billion worldwide. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1672.02s)]
*  I can't believe I'm saying to you, what do you have to say to young directors? Because you are a [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1680.02s)]
*  young director, but as Sinners comes out, what you want people to take away from it and how you [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1685.02s)]
*  want to inspire, I was going to say the next generation, but actually your generation. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1691.02s)]
*  Well, look, I'm what's called an elder millennial. You know, it's the generation of filmmakers [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1698.02s)]
*  coming up behind me, like that's Gen Z, they'll call them Zoomers. But for them, I think they have [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1703.02s)]
*  an incredible advantage to just having grown up with, you know, with smartphones in their pockets. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1710.02s)]
*  You know, I don't think that's an advantage for their psychology, you know what I'm saying? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1716.02s)]
*  But it is an advantage for their filmmaking abilities, you know, to have access to this type of [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1720.02s)]
*  technology constantly. And I think that the movies that I see them make, when I look at things on [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1725.02s)]
*  the internet, I'm just always kind of blown away by the editing style and the way that they see the [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1730.02s)]
*  world. And we need their movies. You know, look, for me, a lot of my business success has been put [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1734.02s)]
*  in the context of me being black. You know, and I think that that's a part of, I think that's a part [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1741.02s)]
*  of the issue when people write about, you know, what my films have done. You know, I'll say this. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1746.02s)]
*  The year Panther 1 came out, yes, it was the highest grossing film ever made by a black person. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1754.02s)]
*  It was also the highest grossing film domestically that year, made by anybody, you know. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1760.02s)]
*  And for some reason, that was never talked about, you know. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1765.02s)]
*  You know, and for me, what I'll speak to, and after coming off of, you know, this movie and [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1768.02s)]
*  researching Delta Blue's music, you know, this music made by people who the state was built to [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1775.02s)]
*  make it so that they had nothing, to make it so that they had to be sharecroppers, you know what [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1783.02s)]
*  I mean, to make it so that they couldn't leave, to make it so that some of these plantations were so [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1788.02s)]
*  massive that they had their own currency and their own banking systems that they would pay them [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1793.02s)]
*  with, you know. They were able to make art that changed the world. That art became rock and roll. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1798.02s)]
*  That art became the country music empire. That art became hip hop. You know, that art became [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1807.02s)]
*  house music. You know, like the fact that their stories were so amazing and so valuable, even [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1812.02s)]
*  though they were being told that they were worthless, you know. Even though they were told that [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1820.02s)]
*  they didn't deserve anything. You know, that has stuck with me. And for me, you know, what I would [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1824.02s)]
*  say to not just young filmmakers, like I think that it's filmmakers of all ages that have yet to [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1830.02s)]
*  make their first movie, you know. So what I would say to aspiring filmmakers, you know, regardless [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1835.02s)]
*  of their age, aspiring filmmakers, filmmakers that are just removed from where you were when you [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1839.02s)]
*  met me in 2013, right, I would say go make your movie. Go make your movie. Even if people are [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1844.02s)]
*  telling you that what you want to make a movie about is not important, keep going. Find a person [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1850.02s)]
*  who will support you, you know what I mean. Get better at your craft and go get it done, you know [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1854.02s)]
*  what I mean, so that you're no longer an aspiring filmmaker. You are just a filmmaker who's looking [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1860.02s)]
*  to make your next game. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1864.02s)]
*  you [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjb_eH0C_vQ&t=1894.02s)]
