# Top U.S. & World Headlines — March 8, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [March 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngNJfXt6xac)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  President Biden delivered the State of the Union Thursday night as he faces the likely
*  prospect of an election rematch with Donald Trump in November and amidst mounting public
*  anger over his enabling of Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  Biden announced plans to tax the wealthy, vowed to restore federal abortion rights and
*  touted his record on relaxing federal marijuana restrictions and punishments.
*  But he also doubled down on his efforts to pass a hardline border and immigration crackdown
*  and repeated far-right Congressmember Marjorie Taylor Greene's use of the term illegal
*  after she heckled him during the speech over the death of a Georgia woman who allegedly
*  was killed by an undocumented immigrant.
*  Biden held up a pin handed to him by Taylor Greene with the killed woman's name on it.
*  He also addressed his age and welcomed Sweden as the newest member of NATO following its
*  formal entry into the military alliance earlier in the day.
*  Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson sat next to Jill Biden as one of her guests.
*  Biden also announced plans for a new port to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza.
*  Tonight, I'm directing the U.S. military to lead an emergency mission to establish
*  a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments
*  carrying food, water, medicine and temporary shelters.
*  As they watched, progressive lawmakers Cory Bush, Summer Lee, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib
*  the only Palestinian American in Congress, held up signs reading,
*  Lasting ceasefire now and stop sending bombs.
*  Tlaib, Summer and Bush also donned Palestinian kafias.
*  Separately, many Democratic women wore white in honor of the suffragettes.
*  Today is International Women's Day.
*  We'll have more on the State of the Union after headlines.
*  Ahead of last night's State of the Union, hundreds of protesters blockaded roads outside
*  the White House and near the Capitol, delaying President Biden's speech.
*  This is Ahmad Abou Zayed with the U.S. campaign for Palestinian rights, speaking from one
*  of the shutdown streets.
*  President Biden's talking about building a port to get aid into Gaza.
*  But the simple formula is stop funding the occupation and the genocide and Palestinians
*  will build their own damn port.
*  Activists also delivered their own People's State of the Union Thursday night.
*  This is Samia Awad of the Dala Justice Project.
*  We're out here representing the majority of Americans who have made it clear time and
*  again in the last five months that they demand a ceasefire now.
*  That they demand no more weapons to Israel.
*  The majority of the people in this country want taxpayer dollars invested in life, not
*  in genocide, not in war.
*  Protests took place elsewhere across the country, including in Chicago, where a coalition of
*  a state of the union, a State of the Union address called State of Genocide.
*  Participants observed a 24-hour vigil in Federal Plaza.
*  Reading aloud the names of over 30,000 Palestinians killed by Israel in the last five months.
*  One of the participants in the State of the Genocide event will be joining us today after
*  headlines.
*  In Gaza, the Health Ministry says Israeli attacks have killed at least 78 people and
*  wounded more than 100 others over the past day.
*  In the southern city of Rafah, at least five people were killed in an Israeli airstrike.
*  As they deplored the destruction, people at the scene blasted President Biden's plans
*  for an aid port.
*  Instead of telling us they will build a port to help us, stop providing the weapons they
*  throw at us.
*  All these American weapons are killing our kids and killing us wherever we go.
*  We don't need aid from them.
*  We need them to stop the killing, stop the death.
*  Wherever we go, we find death.
*  UN experts are calling for a probe into reports of sexual assault, torture and killing of
*  Palestinian women prisoners by Israeli forces.
*  The Palestinian Prisoner Society says an estimated 240 Palestinian women have been detained since
*  October 7th.
*  Some of the released women have since spoken out on their traumatic experiences.
*  This is Hadil Aldadou, who was rounded up and arrested with a group of men in Gaza in
*  December.
*  They put me and the young men in a hole in the ground.
*  The young men were sitting opposite me.
*  One of the soldiers took off my hijab.
*  I started to cry.
*  I was afraid.
*  I asked him if I could have it back.
*  He started to laugh at me and refused to put my hijab back on.
*  In that instance, I was afraid and anxious.
*  My husband was beaten.
*  A soldier fired twice in the air and told me,
*  I killed your husband.
*  The tank started to throw sand towards me and the men.
*  I was trying to get away while I was handcuffed, but the tank kept getting closer to us.
*  I started crying, asking the soldiers what will he do to us.
*  He said, I want to bury you alive in this hole and let the dogs eat you.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Israel is moving ahead with plans to create another 3,400 housing
*  units and illegal settlements, despite condemnation from the United States and other allies.
*  The settlements are a violation of international law.
*  The Wall Street Journal recently published a video showing the surge in illegal settlement
*  building, with new roads and outposts mushrooming in the West Bank since October 7.
*  Palestinian officials have pushed back on the illegal construction, but the vast majority
*  of it has gone unreported or unpunished by the Israeli government.
*  In Nigeria, at least 275 students are missing after dozens of gunmen attacked their school
*  in the northwestern town of Kriga Thursday, kidnapping children between the ages of 8
*  and 15.
*  No group has claimed responsibility.
*  This is the second mass abduction in Nigeria in less than a week.
*  How can these gunmen come and carry our children?
*  This is the reason why I am so sad.
*  This is our village, Kriga.
*  Please Your Excellency, help us.
*  A search and rescue team has been deployed.
*  Abductions of students have become more frequent in recent years, where armed groups target
*  local residents for large ransoms.
*  Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso are launching a joint security force to combat rising extremist
*  violence.
*  The three nations had already formed a security alliance after severing military ties with
*  their former colonizer friends since military hunters took over following a series of recent
*  coups in the Saho region.
*  This comes days after a public prosecutor in Burkina Faso said at least 170 people were
*  executed in three separate attacks in the northern Yatenga province.
*  Violence carried out by militants linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State has been on
*  the rise, forcing millions in Burkina Faso to flee their homes.
*  In Senegal, President Macky Sall announced a new presidential election date, March 24th.
*  Tensions have been mounting in Senegal since President Sall postponed the election last
*  month, triggering mass protests, mass arrests and accusations by opposition politicians
*  that Sall was orchestrating a constitutional coup.
*  President Sall's term ends April 2nd.
*  Haiti's government has extended a state of emergency until April.
*  UN officials warn Haiti's health system is nearing collapse due to shortages of staff,
*  equipment and other resources to treat a growing number of wounded patients as gang unrest
*  continues demanding the resignation of unelected Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry.
*  Many have also denounced police violence against local residents.
*  This situation in the country is critical.
*  People can no longer go about their business.
*  Our children can no longer go to school.
*  Merchants can't go to the market.
*  No one can move around the country.
*  Recently, a tear gas grenade thrown by the police hit a journalist in the eye.
*  The police kill students and they kill activists.
*  Today, they are questioning activists.
*  We have a prime minister.
*  We don't know whether he's dead or alive because he's lost in the wild.
*  Ariel Henry has still not returned to Haiti.
*  He is reportedly in Puerto Rico after coming back from Kenya.
*  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi traveled to the disputed Kashmir region Thursday, his
*  first visit since stripping the Muslim-majority region of its semi-autonomous status in 2019.
*  The decision was held by Hindu nationalist Modi addressed a crowd in Kashmir's largest
*  city, Srinagar.
*  There is no Article 370 today, and that is why the talent of the youth of Jammu and Kashmir
*  is being recognized and respected.
*  They are getting new opportunities.
*  Today there are equal rights and opportunities for everyone here.
*  Rights groups have denounced Modi's intensifying crackdown on journalists and dissidents in
*  Jammu and Kashmir.
*  In Hong Kong, lawmakers published a draft of a new national security law that further
*  cracks down on dissent and free speech.
*  The law expands the definition of certain offenses and targets treason, insurrection,
*  sabotage, external interference, theft of state secrets and espionage.
*  The draft law also imposes harsher penalties for these offenses, including life imprisonment
*  in some cases.
*  The bill is expected to pass swiftly, as only Beijing-aligned lawmakers have been permitted
*  to run an Hong Kong election since 2021.
*  Back in the United States, a federal appeals court has dismissed a child labor case which
*  sought to hold Big Tech accountable for the abuse of children forced to work in cobalt
*  mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
*  Companies including Apple, Microsoft, Tesla and Google rely on cobalt to make the rechargeable
*  lithium batteries used in their products but have argued they merely have a buyer-seller
*  relationship with cobalt suppliers and have no power to stop child labor.
*  The two companies named in the lawsuit are UK-based Glencore and Chinese company Zhejiang
*  Huayu Cobalt.
*  Circuit Judge Naomi Rao acknowledged the tech giants are aware of the child exploitation
*  that they, quote, intentionally use a murky supply chain to obscure the extent to which
*  they rely on forced labor, unquote.
*  The group International Right Advocates, which brought the lawsuit, says it's considering
*  an appeal.
*  In labor news, Google's come under fire after laying off dozens of unionized contract
*  workers in the likely act of retaliation.
*  The workers were made aware of their firing as they spoke last week in front of the Austin
*  City Council in Texas, which was preparing to vote on a resolution in support of their
*  efforts to negotiate with Google.
*  There are less than 50 of us at YouTube Music and we're taking two of the largest corporations
*  in the world.
*  So to be supported by the city of Austin and also our allies in the labor community, give
*  us the motivation to keep this fighting.
*  Not to interrupt, but they just laid us all off.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah.
*  They just laid us all off.
*  We just all—I guess we just all got—
*  Our jobs are ended today.
*  Effective immediately.
*  Wow.
*  I'm sorry, your time has expired.
*  The workers who oversee the YouTube Music platform voted to join the Alphabet Workers
*  Union last year.
*  Since then, Google has refused to bargain with the workers because they're subcontracted
*  through another company.
*  This despite the National Labor Relations Board ruling, Google is a co-employer and
*  must bargain with the group.
*  Google claims the unionized workers were let go because their contract had ended even though
*  it was routinely renewed, and Google has a track record of firing workers during labor
*  organizing efforts.
*  An autopsy report reveals tissue samples from the brain of an Army reservist who killed
*  18 people during a mass shooting at a main bowling alley in Lewiston last October showed
*  signs of traumatic brain injury.
*  Robert Card was found dead at an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound two days later.
*  The 40-year-old worked at an Army hand grenade training range and is thought to have been
*  exposed to thousands of low-level blasts.
*  The findings came as a commission investigating the mass shooting is hearing testimony from
*  several of Card's former Army colleagues.
*  Leading up to the shooting, Maine police had been alerted the gunman was a possible danger
*  after he threatened to shoot up his military base.
*  In election news, President Biden won Wednesday's low turnout primary in Hawaii.
*  Uncommitted received its highest percentage of votes yet, though, with roughly 29 percent
*  of Democratic ballots.
*  The Food and Drug Administration has issued an advisory for six brands of ground cinnamon
*  due to lead contamination.
*  The brands are La Fiesta, Markham, MK, Squad, Supreme, Tradition and LHLR.
*  The FDA said the lead levels in these products are much lower than those found in cinnamon
*  applesauce pouches that were recalled last fall.
*  Long-term lead exposure can pose significant health risks, especially for children.
*  It's been linked to slower development, brain and nervous system damage, behavioral
*  and learning problems and hearing and speech problems.
*  And today marks International Women's Day.
*  Rallies and other actions are planned across the globe, but in a makeshift camp in southern
*  Gaza's Raqqa city, displaced Palestinian women say they're not celebrating this year
*  as they struggle to survive amidst war, hunger, illness and grief.
*  These are some of their voices.
*  WOMEN'S DAY is outside of Palestine.
*  In Palestine, we do not have Women's Day, especially in Gaza.
*  Women have been wiped away.
*  They no longer have an identity here.
*  Before October 7, women here had a good quality of life in their homes.
*  They were secure and happy.
*  They had everything.
*  After October 7, there are no longer any women.
*  Women cannot hold on to their children.
*  The houses have been bombed.
*  This is a war of extermination.
*  This is not just a war.
*  These are people.
*  They have all been destroyed.
*  Every generation is killed.
*  Every generation grows up and is then killed.
*  Are they not humans?
*  You bring up your child with your heart and within moments, within minutes, he's gone
*  and the house he is in is gone.
*  We suffer from violence, from sadness, from injustice, from humiliation, from the hardest
*  forms of torture at the hands of the occupation.
*  My wish on International Women's Day is for this war not to get repeated.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
