Pediatric nurse Sandra Adler Killen has just returned from a third medical mission to Gaza, where she says, "We have this horrific trifecta of starvation, of lack of medicine and supplies, and bombings." She calls Israel's ongoing assault and siege of civilians in Gaza an "annihilation," with skyrocketing rates of anemia, birth defects and premature births.

*  And it was my birthday yesterday, and I can't celebrate either after having been there and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=60.08s)]
*  seeing what all my colleagues are going through, what the people of Gaza are going through. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=65.36s)]
*  We have this horrific trifecta of starvation, of lack of medicine and supplies, and bombings [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  that are dramatically impacting the lives of new mothers and newborns. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=80.16s)]
*  We see an incredible increase in malnutrition levels. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  I was embedded at Al-Aqsa and Nasser hospitals, and seeing, walking down the halls, I was [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=91.12s)]
*  living there during the time that I was there, and seeing the gaut faces of people, whether [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=97.84s)]
*  they were celebrating the birth of their new babies, new life, whether the family members [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=106.72s)]
*  that were there, they had nothing to share, nothing to celebrate, and yet here they were, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=112.88s)]
*  wanting to rejoice in this new life and not knowing what will happen in the future. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=118.48s)]
*  So many children, when I was there the first time, a year ago, I never, ever imagined a [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=123.76s)]
*  year later, not only after seeing the horrors that I saw a year ago and thinking, well, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=130.24s)]
*  there's going to be a ceasefire, things will end, things will get better, this can't go on, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=137.12s)]
*  the world will not let this go on, but yet this annihilation is not only continuing, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=141.28s)]
*  but the levels that I saw with my own eyes, it's just, there are no more words to use, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  unbearable, horrific, indescribable, you know, people can't obtain any kind of care because, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=157.2s)]
*  number one, it's not safe to travel to the hospital, there's no ability for individuals to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=166.48s)]
*  get prenatal care if it's too dangerous to travel, they have no money, no access to get there, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  babies are being born in tents, first-time mothers, with nobody around to help, and these babies are [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=179.27999999999997s)]
*  dying of starvation, babies being brought into the hospital that I witnessed that were not [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=185.92s)]
*  survivable because of all of the blockades, because of the impacts of the bombings and the drone attacks [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=192.32s)]
*  and the inaccessibility, and then you have these incredible high levels of anemia, birth defects, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=202.64s)]
*  I mean, I can go on and on, increasing in amount of premature babies that I saw, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=211.04s)]
*  so many premature babies not surviving, no room in the neonatal intensive care in one of the largest [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=218.4s)]
*  functioning hospitals now in Gaza, so for me to have returned a year from my first visit and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=224.56s)]
*  seeing what my colleagues, what these amazing human beings are doing there in terms of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=234.4s)]
*  showing up every day without pay, having been displaced, having family members of their own [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  having been killed, and yet they show up every day and with lack of food, lack of resources, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=248.56s)]
*  and incredible capability and compassion and strength and love, it was such an honor, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  such a gift for me to be able to be there, and I will return if possible. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=265.12s)]
*  Well, Sandra, we only have about a minute, but I wanted to ask you, Israel is not only [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=270.56s)]
*  blockading food and supplies, but also the medical providers coming into Gaza, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=273.76s)]
*  could you talk about how difficult it is to get in? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=281.76s)]
*  Yeah, correct. So many members have been banned, international, particularly doctors, nurses, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=284.88s)]
*  trying to support the teams there, whether dealing with mass casualties like I did the first time I [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=295.12s)]
*  was there and my focus on infant feeding and nutrition this time, it's truly almost impossible [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  to get team members in. I think 30 to 40 percent are being denied after they've been approved by [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=308.8s)]
*  WHO, and so for us seeing, you know, there were just a handful of us at Nasser Hospital now, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  we're the only compassionate witnesses because press are not allowed, media is not allowed in, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=324.08s)]
*  we're the only international individuals that can witness the true, the true level of what is true. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=329.76s)]
*  Level of what is transpiring there. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  Sandra Adler-Killen, we want to thank you so much for being with us, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=340.32s)]
*  emergency and pediatric nurse, international board-certified lactation consultant, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ADeGb_OOI&t=344.23999999999995s)]
