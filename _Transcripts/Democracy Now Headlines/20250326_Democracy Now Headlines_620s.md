Democratic lawmakers are calling for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and national security adviser Michael Waltz to resign, after they discussed bombing Yemen in a group chat that also included journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic. Waltz had set up the chat on the messaging app Signal and appeared to accidentally add Goldberg, who then got a front-row seat as top officials, including Vice President JD Vance, discussed classified information. The attacks ultimately killed dozens of people in Yemen, including children. Journalist Safa Al Ahmad, who has been reporting on Yemen since 2010, says that while Washington is obsessing over the U.S. national security implications of the group chat, there is almost no criticism of the bombing campaign at the heart of the scandal. “They are killing Yemenis with no recourse for Yemenis themselves,” says Al Ahmad, who notes that U.S. involvement in attacks on Yemen started almost exactly 10 years ago, when a Saudi-led coalition began bombing the country with support from the Obama administration.

“There was actually no legal rationale under the Constitution for doing these strikes,” adds Branko Marcetic, staff writer for Jacobin. “Only Congress is actually able to declare war.”

# 10 Years of War on Yemen: Leaked War Plan Chats Overshadow U.S. Deadly History Targeting Yemen
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Mimi Goodman. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=3.0s)]
*  Several Democratic lawmakers are calling for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and National [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=4.16s)]
*  Security Adviser Mike Walz to resign after they discussed plans to bomb Yemen on a signal [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=8.08s)]
*  group chat. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=13.66s)]
*  Walz had set up the chat, which also included Vice President J.D. Vance, then accidentally, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=14.66s)]
*  apparently, invited the Atlantic magazine editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to join. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=20.72s)]
*  On Tuesday, President Trump downplayed the severity of the lapse, saying it, quote, turned [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=28.32s)]
*  out not to be a serious one. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=32.88s)]
*  Trump also defended Walz, saying he'd learned his lesson and was a good man. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=34.66s)]
*  In the signal chat, Vice President Vance initially argued against the strikes on Yemen, saying, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=38.38s)]
*  quote, three percent of U.S. trade runs through the Suez, 40 percent of European trade does. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=45.08s)]
*  Vance also said, I'm not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=51.44s)]
*  message on Europe right now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=57.72s)]
*  There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=58.72s)]
*  I'm willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=65.28s)]
*  but there's a strong argument for delaying this a month and doing the messaging work [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=69.68s)]
*  on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=74.28s)]
*  In response to the first wave of bombings, Walz posts emojis of a fist, an American flag [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=79.08s)]
*  and fire. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=86.36s)]
*  Over 50 Yemenis were killed during those U.S. strikes on Yemen, including children. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  Democratic Senators grilled Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director Geron [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=93.2s)]
*  Radcliffe over their involvement in the signal chat. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  This is Gabbard responding to a question from Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=99.62s)]
*  There was no classified material that was shared in that signal chat. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=103.44s)]
*  So then if there was no classified material, share it with the committee. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=107.2s)]
*  You can't have it both ways. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=112.64s)]
*  These are important jobs. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  This is our national security. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=115.44s)]
*  The Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard refused to say if she was on the group [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=117.6s)]
*  chat, even though there was a participant with the initials TG. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  National security experts say using signal to share classified information likely violates [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  the Espionage Act and Federal Records Law. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=129.79999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, Congressmember Rashida Tlaib said on social media, quote, more heat for using [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=132.56s)]
*  a group chat than for the bombing itself. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  We're joined now by two guests. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=141.6s)]
*  We're going to begin with Safa Al-Ahmed. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  She's a journalist who's been reporting on Yemen since 2010, award-winning director [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  of the front-line documentaries Yemen Under Siege and The Fight for Yemen, also with us [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  still Branko Marchati, Jacobin staff writer. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=156.04s)]
*  Safa, let's begin with you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=159.56s)]
*  Today is a very significant day. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=163.88s)]
*  Sadly, it's the 10-year anniversary of the Saudi-led war on Yemen, which the U.S. has [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=164.88s)]
*  been backing for these 10 years. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=170.92s)]
*  So it's ironic to me to see messages from Vance saying we have to do more messaging [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=173.12s)]
*  about who the Houthis are when we have, as Americans, been involved in this war for so [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=176.88s)]
*  long. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=182.8s)]
*  The U.S.-backed Saudi-led bombing of Yemen. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=183.8s)]
*  Now, in these attacks on March 15th—and we don't see any mention of this, almost [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=186.88s)]
*  none in the corporate media is talking about the actual attacks. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=193.12s)]
*  What, something like 53 Yemenis were killed? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=196.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=199.24s)]
*  Who were they? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=200.24s)]
*  We don't have specific numbers yet of how many civilians among them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=201.36s)]
*  As you saw in the Pentagon briefing, they denied there were any proof of any civilians [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  killed, even though factually there were children killed. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=210.28s)]
*  But this is a track record of most U.S. administrations of denying that there were any civilian casualties [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=213.86s)]
*  until you actually go on the ground and you prove that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  And I was there the last time the Trump administration had U.S. raids, and they had killed civilians. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  The Pentagon refuses to accept or acknowledge the responsibility for those killings. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=231.28s)]
*  So, Vance's response is very interesting. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=235.48s)]
*  First of all, it's a serious putdown of the president. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  He's saying, I don't think he understands what's going on. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=244.2s)]
*  But he also says he was against the bombing because, why are we doing Europe's work, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=245.2s)]
*  he basically said. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=249.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=250.84s)]
*  And also no timing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=251.84s)]
*  This is only 3 percent of our trade. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=252.84s)]
*  It's 40 percent of Europe's trade. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=253.84s)]
*  Let's do some messaging for a month to explain why we're going against our own philosophy [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=255.72s)]
*  of not supporting Europe. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=261.08s)]
*  Yeah, correct. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=263.4s)]
*  I mean, but this goes to how the United States has not taken responsibility, really. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=264.4s)]
*  They want—double standards here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=270.59999999999997s)]
*  They want to bomb Yemen, regardless of whether they're attacking the Houthis or they're [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=272.44s)]
*  claiming to attack ISIS in al-Qaeda. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=276.64s)]
*  They're—regardless of that, they continue to change the targets of who they are killing [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=279.44s)]
*  in Yemen, but regardless of that, they are killing Yemenis with no recourse for the Yemenis [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=284.70000000000005s)]
*  themselves. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=291.34000000000003s)]
*  So whether it's the interests of Europeans or the Americans, it's been going on in Yemen [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  for so long now with zero, zero accountability. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=295.58000000000004s)]
*  There's over—as per the UN, over 300,000 people have been killed during this war. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=299.5s)]
*  So— [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=305.98s)]
*  Explain why the U.S. is attacking Yemen now. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=306.98s)]
*  Well, they're now attacking Yemen because the Houthis are attacking ships that are going [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=310.26s)]
*  through the Red Sea, through Bab al-Mandeb, which is a strait that the Houthis currently [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=315.26s)]
*  have access to and control. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=321.02s)]
*  And the Houthis are saying that they're doing this in support of the Palestinian people [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=323.18s)]
*  and the people in Gaza specifically because they said, if you lift the siege on Gaza and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=326.98s)]
*  you let the aid in, then we will stop the attacks. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=332.46000000000004s)]
*  And so, preemptively, the United States, this specific time, this March, they started doing [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=336.1s)]
*  that because the Houthis were saying, we're going to start again, because the Israelis [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=341.02000000000004s)]
*  had completely stopped all aid coming into Gaza. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=345.7s)]
*  I wanted to bring Branko Marchitej into this conversation. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=348.3s)]
*  Republicans were even suggesting that Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=354.1s)]
*  who was so shocked that he was included in this chat—it was a signal chat. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=360.54s)]
*  —actually thought it was some kind of disinformation campaign, did not think it was real, had gotten [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=365.86s)]
*  the invite a few days before from the national security adviser, from Mike Waltz. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=371.14s)]
*  But then on that Saturday morning, when he was sitting in a parking lot doing some shopping, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=378.38s)]
*  he saw them say the bombing. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=384.7s)]
*  Hegseth is about to begin. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=386.53999999999996s)]
*  And sure enough, two hours later, all over Twitter, all over X, the bombing had begun. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=388.02s)]
*  He then came to understand that this was for real. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=393.53999999999996s)]
*  Now the Republicans are trying to suggest, even as they attack him as a terrible journalist, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=399.7s)]
*  that he somehow hacked into this. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=404.65999999999997s)]
*  But if he was able to hack into this signal chat, who else was able to? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=407.58s)]
*  What other country was able to, Branko? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=412.02s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, Steve Wittkopf, who was Trump's envoy, who was in Russia at the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=414.06s)]
*  time, and he was on the group chat. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=420.17999999999995s)]
*  So you have to think, if Jeffrey Goldberg was able to hack it, which I don't think [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=421.74s)]
*  is what happened, then surely the Russian government has probably got its hands on their [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=426.06s)]
*  communications as well. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=431.58s)]
*  I mean, I think that this excuse, the idea that Goldberg hacked into it, is a very obvious [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=433.34s)]
*  way to shove blame away from someone like Mike Waltz, who—you know, the uncomfortable [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=440.7s)]
*  question for Waltz here is, why is it that he had Jeffrey Goldberg's number in his [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=448.78000000000003s)]
*  phone so that he mistakenly added him to this chat, when Jeffrey Goldberg is someone who [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=454.90000000000003s)]
*  has written many critical stories about Trump, some journalists that Trump has quite a vendetta [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=459.86s)]
*  against? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=466.7s)]
*  And also, by the way, Jeffrey Goldberg is someone who very prominently sold false information [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=467.7s)]
*  that led to the Iraq War. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=474.26s)]
*  So the question is, beyond everything else that we're talking about, is there a level [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=475.98s)]
*  of discord here within Trump's team that is being exposed that they are now trying [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=479.78000000000003s)]
*  to kind of cover up? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=485.62s)]
*  What do you think, Safa, is most important for people to understand at this point? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=488.82s)]
*  I mean, I think this is not the first time that such a leak has happened. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=493.58000000000004s)]
*  In my last film, when I was in Yemen, the special ops team that had landed in a tiny [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=499.58000000000004s)]
*  little town of Adlan, they had left a medical backpack with the true full names of the special [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=505.18s)]
*  ops soldiers that were there in the attack, plus two more names, just one name. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=512.42s)]
*  And we were wondering, we asked the Pentagon, who are these two names? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=518.98s)]
*  And they were classified dog names that they had brought in with the team, right? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=523.3s)]
*  And the list of names, 22 names, were laminated. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=526.98s)]
*  And so not only did they bring an end, it was laminated, it had full names. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=531.26s)]
*  And so the Trump administration at that time didn't even take responsibility for that [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=535.78s)]
*  or admit that it was wrong. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=539.9399999999999s)]
*  And I would argue that is even more dangerous when you're saying that you have gone into [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=541.62s)]
*  a town to attack a Qaeda compound. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=545.02s)]
*  And so, I mean, the Atlantic journalists showed a lot of restraint by not publishing or saying [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=547.86s)]
*  more when he was added to the team, but they were very lucky. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=554.62s)]
*  I mean, it could have been somebody else. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=559.26s)]
*  I mean, it's really astounding, the level of insecurity in these texts. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=560.26s)]
*  And we just have 10 seconds, but, Barranco, Signal Chat is time to disappear. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=567.26s)]
*  So, of course, the National Archive won't have a record of this planned attack and what [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=574.26s)]
*  was going into it, which was so clearly delineated in the texting of the defense secretary, Hegseth. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=579.1800000000001s)]
*  Fifteen seconds. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=586.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I would just remind people that what we saw in those chats is that there was [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=587.66s)]
*  actually no legal rationale under the Constitution for doing these strikes. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=591.62s)]
*  The rationale was deterrence and shipping, protecting shipping. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=596.26s)]
*  That is not in the Constitution that allows the president to unilaterally launch a war, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=601.2199999999999s)]
*  to this nebulous idea of protecting international shipping. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=605.5799999999999s)]
*  Only Congress is actually able to declare war. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=609.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rucaHgaA3QY&t=617.18s)]
