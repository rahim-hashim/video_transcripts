*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The Biden administration's notified Congress of plans to send another $1 billion in arms
*  to Israel, including tank ammunition, mortars and tactical vehicles.
*  The move comes as President Biden faces criticism from Israel and Republican lawmakers for pausing
*  a single shipment of large bombs to Israel last week.
*  The new $1 billion arms package is being advanced as Israel is widening its assault on Raqqa
*  and other areas of Gaza.
*  More than 550,000 Palestinians have been displaced in recent days.
*  The death toll has topped 35,100.
*  The Palestinian Authority says 80 percent of Gaza's health centers are out of service
*  due to Israeli attacks.
*  This all comes as Palestinians across the globe are marking the 76th anniversary of
*  the Nakba, which means catastrophe in Arabic, when some 700,000 Palestinians were violently
*  expelled from their homes upon Israel's founding.
*  Many Palestinians say they're facing a second Nakba today.
*  This is Hussein Junaid, who had to flee the Jabalia refugee camp.
*  They deported us from the north of Gaza Strip.
*  Here we are thrown on the streets.
*  They destroyed our houses.
*  They killed four children.
*  They were martyred.
*  Among them, a doctor and a head of department.
*  My four older children died.
*  They were martyred.
*  Our homes were destroyed.
*  They shook us and they threw us on the streets.
*  Who is looking for us?
*  Which organization?
*  Which area?
*  And which government?
*  Let them see that we are thrown on the streets with our children and small ones who don't
*  have milk and want food.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Palestinian truck drivers say they fear for their lives after
*  Jewish settlers attacked a convoy of 98 Gaza-bound aid trucks Monday.
*  We went to the checkpoint and after the check, we were surprised to see settlers on the roundabout
*  of the checkpoint.
*  They damaged the cars.
*  They tore the tires off the trucks.
*  They threw the contents of the truck on the ground.
*  We gathered some of the products and sent some of those products onto a bulldozer and
*  sent them to the sheep farms.
*  Around 15 trucks were damaged.
*  Their hall was damaged.
*  Windows of the trucks were broken.
*  Some drivers were beaten.
*  Some of the products were thrown away.
*  And the whole loss for Hebron is around $2 million.
*  While Palestinians are marking the Nakba, Israelis have been celebrating their Independence
*  Day.
*  On Tuesday, a group of far-right Israelis, including a number of government ministers,
*  marched in Siderot, calling for the resettlement of Gaza and the expulsion of Palestinians
*  living there.
*  Speakers included Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gavir, who said, quote,
*  We must return to Gaza now.
*  He also backed what he called the, quote, voluntary migration of Palestinians from Gaza.
*  Protests over Israel's war in Gaza are continuing across the United States.
*  In Mountain View, California, hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters block the entrances
*  to a Google conference for software developers.
*  Ariel Korin is a former Google worker.
*  We are sending a message that Google is the company that is providing the cloud infrastructure
*  for Israel's violent crimes against humanity.
*  And so we will hold the company accountable for this behavior.
*  And you know what?
*  This could all go away.
*  We could be quieted down if Google would do the bare minimum and heed our calls and cancel
*  this contract.
*  Google does not need to profit off of genocide.
*  There is no reason, there is no need for Google to profit off of genocide.
*  And so our demands, they're not radical, they're not difficult.
*  It's really simple.
*  Drop Project Nimbus and drop business with the government and the military of Israel
*  that is guilty of genocide.
*  Here in New York, students at CUNY, the City University of New York, briefly took over
*  a library at the Graduate Center Tuesday night and renamed it Al-Aqsa University Library
*  to honor Gaza's oldest public university, which was destroyed by Israel.
*  At Harvard University, students have ended their three-week Gaza encampment after school
*  officials agreed to meet to discuss divesting from Israel.
*  Isra Azamle is a student organizer at Harvard.
*  We've been organizing for Palestine on Harvard's campus for years.
*  This encampment was not the beginning or the end of our organizing, but it was a beautiful
*  moment of showing how much student power we can build.
*  President Garver has made it very clear from the beginning that he had no interest in negotiating
*  with us, but we showed that we had the student power to actually bring him to discussions.
*  And we're not disillusioned to know that these meetings are actual material wins for divestment,
*  but we are bringing divestment to the table.
*  We are bringing material wins for students like amnesty so that we can continue organizing.
*  What we do see the encampment as is a show of our students' strength, our solidarity,
*  and our power to continue movement building and know that we have the power to come back
*  in the fall and keep fighting for Palestine.
*  Prosecutors are wrapping up their case in the criminal hush money and election interference
*  trial of former President Donald Trump.
*  On Tuesday, Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen admitted he misled the Federal Election
*  Commission about hush money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels.
*  Cohen said he did so in order to, quote, demonstrate loyalty to Mr. Trump, unquote.
*  Mike Johnson, Senator J.D. Vance, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum were among a number of
*  Trump allies to show up at the New York courthouse Tuesday and do what Trump can't do, bash
*  the prosecution and attack Michael Cohen's testimony.
*  Primaries were held Tuesday in Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia.
*  In Maryland, Angela also broke one, the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate, in her bid to
*  become the first black senator from Maryland.

*  The bill has sparked weeks of street protests.
*  President Biden's announced new tariffs on $18 billion of Chinese imports, including
*  electric vehicles and solar cells.
*  The tariffs on electric vehicles will increase to 100 percent in an effort to prevent Chinese
*  electric cars from being sold in the United States in a move that critics say contradicts
*  Biden's pledge to combat the climate crisis by transitioning away from gas-powered vehicles.
*  The Chinese government condemned the new tariffs, saying the moves will, quote, severely affect
*  the atmosphere for bilateral cooperation, unquote.
*  The U.S. Justice Department has determined Boeing has violated the terms of a 2021 deferred
*  prosecution deal that was reached after the fatal crashes of two 737 MAX planes in Ethiopia

*  The DOJ's determination could reopen the door to the government prosecuting Boeing,
*  which has been plagued by safety issues on its planes.
*  In a statement in Florida, at least eight migrant farm workers from Mexico died in a
*  bus accident as they headed to work on a watermelon farm.
*  Forty other farm workers were injured.
*  The accident occurred when a truck collided with the bus carrying the workers.
*  The driver of the truck has been arrested and charged with driving under the influence
*  manslaughter.
*  In a statement, the Farmworker Association of Florida said, quote, farm workers tend
*  to be forgotten, but it's important not to forget farm workers, especially during
*  such difficult times, unquote.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
