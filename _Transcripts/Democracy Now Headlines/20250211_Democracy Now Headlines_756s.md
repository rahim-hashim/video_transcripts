*  This fight is about more than just Democrat versus Republican politics. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=338.36s)]

*  crackdown on immigrant communities. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=487.88s)]
*  The DOJ is calling for the charges to be dropped without prejudice, meaning they can be revived [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=490.28s)]
*  at any point. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=495.64s)]
*  The order came on the same day Adams reportedly ordered his staff not to publicly criticize [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=497.08s)]
*  Trump and not to intervene with federal immigration enforcement. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=502.59999999999997s)]
*  This comes amidst mounting confusion and mixed messages from the Adams administration [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=506.76s)]
*  over how workers should respond to ICE if they show up at city buildings like schools [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=512.36s)]

*  convicted and jailed for attempting to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=545.72s)]
*  Blagojevich's prison term was cut short in 2020 when Trump commuted his sentence during [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=549.5600000000001s)]
*  his first presidency. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=554.9200000000001s)]
*  The U.S. Senate voted Monday to advance Tulsi Gabbard's nomination to become director of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=557.1600000000001s)]
*  national intelligence. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=561.8000000000001s)]
*  Many Democrats have opposed Gabbard's nomination over her 2017 meeting with Syria's then leader, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=562.76s)]
*  Bashar al-Assad, and past comments blaming NATO for Russia's war on Ukraine. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=568.12s)]

*  content. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=582.6s)]
*  But we're not considering Ms. Gabbard for some position in which her bizarre fondness [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=583.96s)]
*  for foreign despots is beside the point. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=589.32s)]
*  She is not the nominee for postmaster general. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=592.2s)]
*  We're considering her for one of the most important jobs in our intelligence community. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=595.88s)]
*  And for that, Tulsi Gabbard is a walking five alarm fire and must be rejected. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPCpbfX3Gs&t=602.6s)]
