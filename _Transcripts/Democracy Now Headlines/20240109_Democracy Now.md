**Democracy Now!:** [January 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HjFkGMBbqk)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken's in Israel today, meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
*  Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials as Israel's bombardment of Gaza continues
*  for a 95th day.
*  Blinken's on a multi-nation trip across the Middle East.
*  On Monday, he met with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
*  Health officials in Gaza say it's been another devastating 24-hour period.
*  The bodies of 57 Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes have been taken to Al Aqsa Hospital,
*  the only remaining hospital in central Gaza.
*  The hospital also took in 65 injured Palestinians as the hospital's few remaining doctors
*  struggled to treat the wounded.
*  Over the weekend, Doctors Without Borders and other NGOs pulled staff from the hospital
*  due to concern for their safety in heavy Israeli attacks.
*  Meanwhile, the Israeli human rights group Bat Salam has accused Israel of purposely
*  starving the people of Gaza.
*  In a new report, the group said starvation is, quote, not a byproduct of war but a direct
*  result of Israel's declared policy, they said.
*  In Rafah, displaced Palestinians denounced Blinken and the United States for supporting
*  Israel's assault.
*  We hold America and Blinken accountable as they help Israel kill children and provided
*  weapons.
*  So whether Blinken comes or not, he will never change anything.
*  We will remain steadfast, and victory will be for us.
*  We will show America and Israel something that they have never seen.
*  Israel has also carried out a number of military raids in the occupied West Bank.
*  On Monday, Israeli forces shot dead three Palestinian men in the city of Tolcarum.
*  Video has emerged showing an Israeli military vehicle running over one of the men who'd
*  been shot.
*  More than 340 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces and settlers in the West
*  Bank since Hamas attacked Israel October 7th.
*  The Israeli newspaper Haaretz is reporting 70 lawmakers in the Israeli Knesset have signed
*  a motion to expel Ofer Kasif from the legislative body after he signed a petition supporting
*  South Africa's genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice.
*  Kasif, who is Jewish, denounced the move to expel him as a member of the Knesset, pointing
*  out no action has been taken against lawmakers who've called for the complete destruction
*  of Gaza or back the removal of all Palestinians from Gaza.
*  Earlier today, Israeli President Isaac Herzog met with Tony Blinken and criticized South
*  Africa's genocide case.
*  On Thursday, a proceeding will start in the International Court of Justice in The Hague,
*  whereby South Africa has sued Israel for supposedly genocide.
*  There's nothing more atrocious and preposterous than this claim, where we are doing our utmost
*  under extremely complicated circumstances on the ground to make sure that there will
*  be no unintended consequences and no civilian casualties.
*  On Monday, Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the British Labour Party, called on Britain
*  to back South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice.
*  Twenty-two thousand people have already been killed, 1.9 million displaced, thousands dying
*  in the rubble, thousands of children dying because of lack of medical care and food,
*  people dying of starvation and thirst and hunger in the Gaza Strip at the present time.
*  Cannot the Government understand the anger around the world when they watch this in real
*  time happening and why so many people are very pleased that the Government of South
*  Africa has taken an initiative in going to the International Court in order to hold Israel
*  to account for the deaths of so many wholly innocent people in Gaza?
*  Can't the Government understand that and at least support the South African process?
*  So far, just a handful of countries have publicly supported South Africa's genocide case against
*  Israel – Bolivia, Turkey, Malaysia and Jordan.
*  Israel's reportedly carried out another targeted strike inside southern Lebanon, killing
*  three members of Hezbollah earlier today.
*  This comes one day after an Israeli drone strike assassinated Wissam al-Tawil.
*  He was the most senior Hezbollah figure killed by Israel in recent months.
*  The Washington Post is reporting U.S. officials are concerned that Israeli Prime Minister
*  Benjamin Netanyahu sees expanding the war to Lebanon as, quote, key to his political
*  survival.
*  President Biden denounced the poison of white supremacy Monday during a speech at the Mother
*  Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where the white supremacist Dylann Roof shot
*  dead nine black parishioners in 2015.
*  Many analysts say the speech was part of an effort by Biden to shore up support from black
*  voters.
*  Biden's speech was disrupted when a group of activists started chanting, Cease Fire
*  Now.
*  As the protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza were removed from the church, supporters
*  of Biden started chanting four more years.
*  then address the protest.
*  Here in New York, at least 325 protesters were arrested Monday morning when they blocked
*  the entrances to three major bridges and a tunnel in Manhattan.
*  Demonstrators were calling for a Gaza ceasefire.
*  I'm part of a large group of people who are shutting down downtown Manhattan.
*  We're taking four sites.
*  We're taking Brooklyn Bridge, where we are now, Williamsburg Bridge, Manhattan Bridge
*  and the Hollow Tunnel in solidarity with Palestine and against the war in Gaza.
*  We're hoping that with this action we can inspire others to keep agitating, keep escalating
*  and keep disrupting until we have like shown that we will not stop until the U.S. supports
*  a permanent ceasefire.
*  Organizers of the protests included Jewish Voice for Peace, Palestinian Youth Movement
*  and Democratic Socialists of America.
*  Boeing 737 MAX 9 jets remained grounded after a refrigerator-sized fuselage door plug blew
*  off on Friday on an Alaska Airlines plane near Portland, Oregon.
*  And United Airlines say they found loose bolts and other problems on some of the grounded
*  jets.
*  Meanwhile, the online news outlet The Lever is reporting employees at a Boeing subcontractor
*  were told to falsify records after inspection teams found, quote, excessive amount of defects
*  in parts being made for Boeing.
*  Spirit AeroSystems reportedly manufactured the door that blew out on the Alaska Airlines
*  flight.
*  Lever reports a group of Spirit shareholders filed a federal complaint last year saying
*  Spirit executives had, quote, prioritized production numbers and short-term financial
*  outcomes over product quality.
*  Spirit was established nearly two decades ago as a spinoff of Boeing.
*  We'll have more on this exposé after headlines.
*  Donald Trump's expected to be inside a federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., today, as
*  his lawyers argue.
*  The former president has absolute immunity from prosecution from charges he tried to
*  overthrow the 2020 election.
*  Trump's claiming his actions are part of his official duties as president.
*  But in a legal brief, special counsel Jack Smith has warned that granting Trump immunity
*  from criminal prosecution would be, quote, particularly dangerous due to his efforts
*  to try to remain in office beyond his term.
*  On Monday, Trump's legal team also filed a request to dismiss state charges in Georgia
*  over election interference, citing presidential immunity.
*  Trump's court appearance in Washington comes less than a week before the January 15 caucus
*  in Iowa.
*  In Brazil, rallies in defense of democracy were held Monday, marking one year since thousands
*  of supporters of former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro stormed several government
*  buildings in an attempt to topple newly elected President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
*  Lula spoke Monday, hailing the victory of democracy over authoritarianism after the
*  January 8th insurrection.
*  If the coup attempt had been successful, much more than glass, furniture, works of art and
*  historical objects would have been stolen and destroyed.
*  The sovereign will of the Brazilian people that was expressed at the ballot box would
*  have been stolen and democracy would have been destroyed.
*  Scientists with the European Union have confirmed 2023 was the hottest year on record and likely
*  the warmest in the last 100,000 years.
*  While the heat records were broken every month last year from June to December, the head
*  of the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service said, quote,
*  In Bangladesh, more than 7,000 Rohingya refugees have been left homeless after a fire destroyed
*  about 800 shelters in the Cox's Bazar refugee camp, where nearly a million Rohingya refugees
*  live after fleeing Burma.
*  And in Tacoma, Washington, dozens of asylum seekers from India jailed at the Northwest
*  Detention Center have been on hunger strike for nearly a week demanding their release
*  and a fair due process.
*  Strikers in denouncing their indefinite detention and other dangerous conditions at the detention
*  center, many of the asylum seekers told the advocacy group La Resistencia that Immigration
*  and Customs Enforcement officials had threatened them with force-feeding unless they ended
*  Northwest is run by the for-profit prison corporation GeoGroup and has seen a wave of
*  recent hunger strikes, most recently one that lasted over 50 days.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
