The U.N.'s humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher warned Tuesday that 14,000 babies could die in Gaza over the next 48 hours if more aid does not enter the besieged territory. The warning comes as Israel expands its military assault, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing to take control of the entire Gaza Strip. "The suffering is really beyond description," says Mahmoud Alsaqqa, Oxfam's food security and livelihoods coordinator in Gaza, who speaks with Democracy Now! from Gaza City.

*  Fletcher issued the warning during an interview on the BBC earlier today. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=20.44s)]
*  The situation is dire. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=26.04s)]
*  The real test of the words will be whether we can get that aid in. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=28.08s)]
*  We are there on the border right now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=31.839999999999996s)]
*  We have thousands of trucks ready to go. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=34.08s)]
*  We know how to do this. We've done it before. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=37.16s)]
*  And we are demanding that the world back us in pushing Israel to let us get in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=38.96s)]
*  and reach those people who are starving right now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=43.8s)]
*  And yesterday it was five, five trucks of aid that went in, not fit for purpose in this case. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=47.0s)]
*  No, that's a drop in the ocean. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  And let's be clear, those five trucks are just sat on the other side of the border right now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=55.72s)]
*  They've not reached the communities they need to reach. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=59.48s)]
*  And, you know, let me describe what is on those trucks. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=62.44s)]
*  This is baby food, baby nutrition. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  There are 14,000 babies that will die in the next 48 hours unless we can reach them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=67.44s)]

*  contained burial shrouds, not food. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=84.0s)]
*  The group's head, Rami Abdu, said, quote, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=87.44s)]
*  This isn't food. It's preparation for mass death. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=90.24s)]
*  Gaza isn't being fed. It's being buried, unquote. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=94.72s)]
*  This comes as Israel expands its military assault on Gaza with Israeli Prime Minister [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=99.96000000000001s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=163.96s)]

*  We last spoke to you exactly a week ago with your Ox from your office there in Gaza City. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  Since then, Israel's bombardment of Gaza has intensified. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=185.68s)]
*  Palestinians are fleeing Khan Yunis, the second largest city in Gaza, and Israeli attacks [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=190.0s)]
*  killed hundreds of Palestinians over the weekend, including five journalists. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=195.0s)]
*  Can you describe the situation at this point? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  As Israel's saying, they are partially lifting the blockade. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=203.36s)]
*  Talk about what's getting in, what's getting out. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=207.56s)]
*  How many trucks are needed to come into Gaza at this point? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for having me again. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=217.36s)]
*  Unfortunately, the situation since our last meeting has been not even improved. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=220.56s)]
*  It's on the contract. It's deteriorating. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  And what's happening right now in Gaza is really heartbreaking. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=230.92s)]
*  The conditions of the families, our families, our friends, of the people here become truly unbearable. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  And the suffering is really beyond description. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=243.12s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you. There are some tracks. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=246.12s)]
*  We are talking about five trucks coming into Gaza yesterday, but it's merely a drop in the ocean compared to the overwhelming needs of the Gazans. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=248.8s)]
*  Imagine imagine that people here in Gaza are starving since more than 77 days due to the Israeli full blockade without having any supplies in either food, medical or any humanitarian supplies. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=258.64s)]
*  And now we are talking about just five trucks that could be a support in responding to these needs. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=273.04s)]
*  Just before this full blockade during the ceasefire phase, we used to have 600 trucks per day. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=279.92s)]
*  So now we are talking about five trucks, even if it's increased in the coming days, it could reach 30 trucks. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=288.44s)]
*  But it's nothing compared to the high needs of the people here in Gaza. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=294.8s)]
*  Just to give you also and how is the situation on the ground? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=299.8s)]
*  The people now are really suffering. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=305.76s)]
*  Children are crying out in hunger and even most of the time they are both sleep hungry. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=309.96s)]
*  The parents, the father, the mothers are now preferring to be to be just die without having or seeing their children in such a position. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=317.36s)]
*  And they didn't have any power to help in that regards. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=329.44s)]
*  This is this is what we are witnessing right now. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=333.2s)]
*  And, Makmoud, ever since the Israel ended the ceasefire, what has been the presence of Israeli soldiers within Gaza? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=337.12s)]
*  Because obviously Benjamin Netanyahu keeps talking about a major offensive. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=348.76s)]
*  To what degree is the Israeli military occupying major sector sections of Gaza? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=354.24s)]
*  You know, right now, in parallel to this, all these things happening, they are intensifying their their offensive military operation in the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=362.0s)]
*  As you already said, there is an evacuation orders for a new areas of the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=372.52s)]
*  The whole North Governorate and the whole government are now under evacuation order. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=377.16s)]
*  We are now talking more than 70 percent of the of the Gaza Strip under such no go zones or or evacuation orders. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=385.52s)]
*  And you can imagine the conditions of the people who have been displaced without having any belongings and without having any means of survival. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=394.72s)]
*  These conditions is also as a priority and we are expecting the worst is coming as they are all the nice. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  And over the day, they are just bombarding everywhere in the Gaza Strip, in the evacuated areas and even in the crowded areas, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=409.92s)]
*  in the shelters and makeshift camps where it's like the essentials for the people to survive in these situations. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=418.88s)]
*  You can imagine the crowdness that nowadays in the Gaza Strip where a lot of people are crowded in tiny places. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=424.8s)]
*  This is like any essentials for public health, for food, for for any survival means in that in that time. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=432.12s)]
*  On Friday, President Trump told reporters, quote, A lot of people are starving in in Gaza. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=440.76s)]
*  And he said he wanted to help reduce the suffering. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=448.67999999999995s)]
*  But what has the United States actually done from what you can tell in terms of relieving the suffering of the of the Palestinians there? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=452.24s)]
*  Unfortunately, we were expecting more during this visit, to be honest, in reaching a permanent and lost the last ceasefire. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=462.28s)]
*  But unfortunately, until now, we didn't have anything. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=469.79999999999995s)]
*  During the last few days, we have an increasing international pressure, which was good after 19 months of this suffering of the people in Gaza Strip. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=473.4s)]
*  We are seeing some people are really making some pressure to the Israeli. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=481.44s)]
*  And this is this is why we are afraid that this is limited gesture of having some aids in. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=485.48s)]
*  It's likely made under this pressure. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=492.8s)]
*  And it's not a genuine step from from the Israeli side towards resolving this humanitarian catastrophe. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=495.28s)]
*  What we are looking for right now is to make this pressure and to hold Israel accountable to this full blockade in a human and and in a human blockade. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=501.48s)]
*  So they can open this this border and we can we can as a humanitarian agencies can work in supporting those people in needs. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=513.9599999999999s)]
*  And also the same times while we are asking for this opening of the of the borders, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=521.76s)]
*  we are asking for a ceasefire because the people are really exhausted during the last 19 months of having constant fear and having all these displacement times for the people. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=527.28s)]
*  So we need this opening for the borders. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=539.56s)]
*  We need to have this ceasefire that could be lost and could be a permanent ceasefire so we can as agencies can provide the support for the people, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=542.8399999999999s)]
*  the Americans and the Israeli. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=551.24s)]
*  Now they are providing and introducing a new mechanism for it and which is as we have reiterated that it is not in line with the international humanitarian law. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=553.28s)]
*  It's excluding the elderly and the sick, the people with disabilities. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=565.3599999999999s)]
*  We as organization, UN agencies and international NGOs, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=569.9599999999999s)]
*  we have the infrastructure in place and we have a rigorous system in that regards and we have our our our operation in place. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=573.4s)]
*  So it's it's no need to reinvent a new tool or mechanism. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=580.9599999999999s)]
*  All that is needed is to allow the organization to work freely in supporting the people in need without enforcing the people to go to a militarized zones to get their supplies from, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=585.0s)]
*  which is unprotected and inhuman for the world. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=598.68s)]
*  And it's just reiterated that Israeli is weaponizing and instrumentalizing the aid as as a tool of control. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=602.2399999999999s)]
*  Your response to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that Israel is going for total victory in Gaza. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=611.4399999999999s)]
*  What what what what is the meaning of total victory of Gaza? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=624.56s)]
*  Is the meaning of total victory that we are killing hundreds of people on a daily basis? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=628.68s)]
*  Are we are our total victory is to displace the people multiple times. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=633.96s)]
*  Nowadays, people are some people, some families have been displaced for more than 20 times. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=638.84s)]
*  You can imagine what's the meaning of displacement. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=644.28s)]
*  I'm sure that most of the people already seen some pictures and scenes where the elderly people are enforced to flee their their places, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=646.68s)]
*  walking on the streets in a very weak infrastructure and trying to evacuate from those areas without having any belongings or without having any means. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=656.16s)]
*  So what is the total victory means? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=666.52s)]
*  The total victory is to support the people is to be accountable for the international humanitarian. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=668.52s)]
*  No, not to preach it or violating or a continuous offensive military operation on the on the grounds and in the honest and people innocent people here in Gaza Strait. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAl3BNJFWQ&t=673.76s)]
