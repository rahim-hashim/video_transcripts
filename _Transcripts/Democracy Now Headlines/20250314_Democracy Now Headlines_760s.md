*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=5.64s)]
*  Two federal judges, one in California, one in Maryland, on Thursday ordered 19 federal [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=7.24s)]
*  agencies to rehire some 20,000 probationary workers who'd recently been fired as part [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=13.64s)]
*  of President Trump and Elon Musk's massive government layoffs. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=20.12s)]
*  The pair have also been blocked from further axing those agencies, including the Education [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=24.7s)]
*  Department, which announced this week it was reducing its workforce by roughly one-half. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=31.06s)]
*  The measures provide some temporary relief, as labor groups, Democratic attorneys general [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=37.7s)]
*  and others challenge the White House's attempt to dismantle the federal government. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=43.22s)]
*  Separately on Thursday, another federal judge ordered Elon Musk and his so-called Department [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=49.5s)]
*  of Government Efficiency to hand over documents related to Doge's operations. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=54.78s)]
*  The case was brought by 14 Democratic attorneys general and argues Doge has been unconstitutionally [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=60.1s)]
*  ordering the mass federal layoffs. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=66.98s)]
*  In a surprise turnabout, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced he's voting for [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=70.4s)]
*  a Republican measure to keep the government funded, splitting from the majority of the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=76.42s)]
*  Democratic caucus, which had been poised to block the bill. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=81.5s)]
*  Schumer argued that letting the government shut down would cause even more harm to people [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=85.42s)]
*  and give free rein to President Trump and Elon Musk to further dismantle federal agencies. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=90.58s)]
*  Most Democrats say the continuing resolution would also be a blank check for the White [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=96.86s)]
*  House and will defund essential food, education and healthcare programs. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=101.6s)]
*  It's not clear yet which other Democrats will support Schumer's move, other than [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=105.86s)]
*  Senator John Fetterman, who had already announced he would vote in favor of the funding package. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=110.3s)]
*  At least eight Democrats need to back the measure alongside Republicans for it to pass. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=115.38s)]
*  The news left many House Democrats incensed, including New York Congressmember Alexandria [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=121.05999999999999s)]
*  Ocasio-Cortez, who's been calling on her supporters to ramp up public pressure on Democrats [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=126.66s)]

*  Just to see Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think it is a [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=138.28s)]
*  huge slap in the face, and I think that there is a wide sense of betrayal. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=145.76s)]

*  this kind of illegal, undemocratic activity on us. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=212.28s)]
*  And we believe that it's deeply important to stand up in these kinds of moments, to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=215.84s)]
*  say that we will not sit idly by, we will not comply. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAiZ4elHwJ8&t=219.72s)]
