**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=3.0s)]
*  We look now at the massive protests that erupted Saturday as over a million people took to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=4.36s)]
*  the streets nationwide to tell President Trump and billionaire Elon Musk hands-offs, saying [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=9.16s)]
*  no to the Trump administration's dismantling of federal agencies and social programs and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=13.44s)]
*  its attacks on LGBTQ people, immigrants, education, healthcare, science, free speech and reproductive [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=18.12s)]
*  rights. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=24.0s)]
*  The coordinated hands-off protests are the largest demonstrations since President Trump [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=25.0s)]
*  returned to office. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=29.36s)]
*  They took place across all 50 states and across the world. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=30.36s)]
*  In Europe, thousands gathered in Berlin, Paris and London to respond to Trump's sweeping [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=33.84s)]
*  tariffs, which have shocked the global economy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=39.28s)]
*  This is a banker speaking from London. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=41.6s)]
*  He's a horrible, small-minded person who is easily maneuvered. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=43.64s)]
*  And the people who are maneuvering him are very, very, very dangerous. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=53.44s)]
*  He's very dangerous, but he's a small-minded and not, frankly, very smart person. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=57.32s)]
*  So, no, I just—I hope—I don't know what to hope. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=63.32s)]
*  I just hope this is over soon. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=68.0s)]
*  Thousands also took to the streets across Canada to protest Trump's repeated threats [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=70.84s)]
*  of making Canada the 51st U.S. state. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=74.72s)]
*  Demonstrators condemned Trump's remarks as a threat to Canadian sovereignty. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=78.08s)]
*  This is a Vancouver protester. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  Today, I'm out here to send a simple, clear message to the United States that we're not [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=83.27999999999999s)]
*  going to want to be a part of you. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=88.6s)]
*  We're never going to want to be a part of you. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  This is very close to becoming a reality down there. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  Right now, we have our very own election, which is extremely scary with what we're seeing [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=95.72s)]
*  as being the unsaid messages from one side. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  And I'm here as a visual reminder to let people know that we're not going to let this happen. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=105.44s)]
*  We're not going to sit quietly. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=110.4s)]
*  In the United States, there are over 1,200 protests, like this one in Los Angeles. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=112.44s)]
*  Well, I've marched before when he first got elected a number of years ago, and I still [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=117.36s)]
*  can't believe that he got elected again. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=123.72s)]
*  And I can't believe that he's tanking the economy and he's tanking the government, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=125.44s)]
*  and it's all being done for him and for Elon Musk and all the billionaires and everybody [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=130.36s)]
*  else. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=135.68s)]
*  It's not for me. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=136.68s)]
*  It's not for the people who live in my neighborhood. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=137.68s)]
*  It's for all of these billionaires. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=140.11999999999998s)]
*  And I'm glad to see so many people came out today. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=142.92s)]
*  I mean, we need it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=145.92s)]
*  I want more people to show up and get them out of office. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=147.44s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=150.92s)]
*  There were over 20 protests across the state of Colorado, like this one in Denver in the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=151.92s)]
*  freezing cold, including former and current workers. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=158.32s)]
*  My name is Marina Connors, and this one says, Hands Off Public Lands. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=161.88s)]
*  I'm a retired National Park Service employee, and it's kind of—it's really hard to run [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  the parks, and to do it under these circumstances is even more and more difficult. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  I am a federal employee today and hope that I can stay that, hope that I can stay employed [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=178.28s)]
*  so that I can continue to serve the American people who I swore to serve when I took my [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=187.12s)]
*  oath of office. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=192.48s)]
*  That federal worker covered her face, but her sign said—with her sign, it said, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=193.72s)]
*  I want DEI in schools, not measles. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=198.76s)]
*  Protesters estimated to be in the tens of thousands gathered in Washington, D.C. in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=202.16s)]
*  mass opposition to Trump's policies. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  A sea of banners and placards filled the Washington Mall, including signs that read, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=207.44s)]
*  Resist like it's 1938 Nazi Germany and fascism alive and well and living in the White House. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=211.56s)]
*  Speakers included Congressmembers Ilhan Omar and Jamie Raskin. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=217.0s)]
*  They say though, well, the number of courts striking down Trump's policies is completely [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  unprecedented. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, so what? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  That's only because the number of his illegal actions are completely unprecedented. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=232.28s)]
*  The judges are doing their jobs. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=240.24s)]
*  They're doing their jobs. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  Just tell MAGA what democratic movements all over the world tell the dictators of the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=247.12s)]
*  world. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=252.28s)]
*  Hands off the courts! [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=253.28s)]
*  Hands off the courts! [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=256.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, another protest Saturday in D.C. demanded an arms embargo against Israel and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=257.4s)]
*  an end to the Gaza genocide and the release of Mahmoud Khalil, Ramesa Ozturk and other [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=263.0s)]
*  foreign university students and faculty who remain in ICE detention, targeted for their [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=267.92s)]
*  involvement in Palestinian rights protests. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=272.36s)]
*  This is Mohammed Habeh from the American Muslims for Palestine. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=274.8s)]
*  I'm here today because for the past year and a half we have seen the utter destruction [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=278.24s)]
*  going on in Gaza funded by American taxpayer dollars. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=287.2s)]
*  We've seen it in the previous administration and we see now that Donald Trump is continuing [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=290.72s)]
*  and making it worse for the people in Gaza. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=296.92s)]
*  After a month of fasting in the month of Ramadan, we saw that the people in Gaza were suffering [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=300.08s)]
*  of famine as well as seeing Israel break the ceasefire and begin massacring Palestinians [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=305.64s)]
*  throughout the month and on the day of Eid. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=313.52s)]
*  I'm here today because I want the people of Gaza to see that the American people will [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=316.0s)]
*  not accept this, that the American people will stand up against our government as they [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=321.0s)]
*  continue to support this genocide. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=325.41999999999996s)]
*  My name is Eugene Peryear. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm with the ANSR Coalition and we're demanding the immediate end of the genocide in Gaza. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=329.74s)]
*  The U.S. should stop all of its forms of complicity and facilitation of that genocide and do everything [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=335.14000000000004s)]
*  in its power to bring it to an end immediately. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=340.3s)]
*  And we're also demanding the release of the students who have been taken off the streets, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=342.98s)]
*  abducted and jailed simply for standing with the Palestinian people and for all those who [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=347.06s)]
*  have been repressed because of the steps they've taken to stand up for the right of self-determination [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=351.38s)]
*  and liberation of Palestine, to have all charges, all lawsuits or anything like that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=356.34s)]
*  dropped and allow people to speak up and speak out against this genocide. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=360.34s)]
*  And here in New York City, up to 100,000 people took to the streets in Manhattan, marching [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=365.85999999999996s)]
*  from Bryant Park to Madison Square Park. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=372.29999999999995s)]
*  Democracy Now! was there. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=376.82s)]
*  There were many issues discussed. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=378.73999999999995s)]
*  Among them, Ramesa Osturk, that Tufts student who was sent to Louisiana after being driven [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=381.18s)]
*  to Vermont, picked off the streets of Somerville, Massachusetts by masked agents. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=390.5s)]
*  A judge has ruled her case has to be sent back to Vermont. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=395.98s)]
*  These were some of the voices. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=400.7s)]
*  My name is Sarah. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=402.1s)]
*  I'm not with the group. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=407.1s)]
*  I went to Tufts University, and that is where Ramesa Osturk was disappeared from. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=408.94s)]
*  And she is owed due process and a chance to continue her education. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=414.82s)]
*  And she was here legally, and it should never be considered illegal to write an op-ed. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=418.5s)]
*  Whether you agree or disagree with what she said, it's her right. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=422.85999999999996s)]
*  And I just want her to be free. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=426.41999999999996s)]
*  And I want that for all the people who have been disappeared by the Trump administration. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=428.53999999999996s)]
*  Is the Tufts community active on Ramesa's case? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=432.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=437.17999999999995s)]
*  The president sent out an email the other day. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=438.66s)]
*  The university is standing with Ramesa and her lawyers. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=441.54s)]
*  And also many of my fellow alum have stood up, signed letters, and taken action to free [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=445.02s)]
*  Ramesa and get justice for her. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=449.26s)]
*  Christine Harrington. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=463.1s)]
*  And I'm with lots of friends. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=464.42s)]
*  And I'm a professor at NYU. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=467.42s)]
*  And we're— [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=469.42s)]
*  What do you teach? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=470.42s)]
*  I teach law and politics. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=471.42s)]
*  So, I watched you. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=472.42s)]
*  What do you think is happening to the universities? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=477.42s)]
*  There are, you know, some of them are caving. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=481.42s)]
*  And the first ones are caving. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=485.42s)]
*  Not so good. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=487.42s)]
*  Not so good at all. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=488.42s)]
*  But that's why we're out here. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=490.42s)]
*  What do you think the universities should do? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=493.42s)]
*  Fight back. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=496.66s)]
*  Make it clear. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=499.66s)]
*  This is unacceptable. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=500.66s)]
*  It has never happened. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=501.66s)]
*  And it will not happen. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=503.66s)]
*  I mean, to mobilize together. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=504.66s)]
*  But the caving we saw starting with Columbia and the spread has just made some universities [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=507.66s)]
*  figure, duck and cover, you know, we'll get through this. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=517.66s)]
*  That's not what universities should be about. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=520.66s)]
*  My name is Jeanine Georgette. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=526.66s)]
*  I can't believe I'm still have to protest this sh— because I can't believe it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=531.66s)]
*  I mean, I've been out protesting since I was about five. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=538.66s)]
*  It was the first time I remember holding a sign. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=541.66s)]
*  That we are so under attack. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=544.66s)]
*  Our country is being torn down. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=547.42s)]
*  I don't really know why. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=549.66s)]
*  Like I don't get what they get from tearing our country apart. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=551.3s)]
*  But they're pulling it down. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=555.58s)]
*  And so I'm out here to try to keep it upright. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=557.58s)]
*  What does the other side say? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=562.58s)]
*  Pay back as a bitch. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=564.58s)]
*  And she votes. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=566.58s)]
*  Do you think a protest like this and tens of thousands of people can make a difference? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=569.58s)]
*  You know, I saw it make a difference in the Vietnam War. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=573.58s)]
*  When so many people get together like this, politicians notice. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=576.58s)]
*  And so yes, the protests around the Vietnam War stopped it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=580.6600000000001s)]
*  There's no doubt in my mind. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=585.6600000000001s)]
*  And so this kind of activism, they notice. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=587.6600000000001s)]
*  They take note. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=590.6600000000001s)]
*  My sign says stop the mass kidnappings with no due process. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=595.6600000000001s)]
*  Dictators want to be and felon Donald Trump. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=600.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just very upset about him taking these people. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=604.6600000000001s)]
*  And sending them to El Salvador without any due process. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=609.74s)]
*  Yeah, he says that it's because they are from Tren Díaragua. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=613.74s)]
*  But he didn't prove this. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=618.74s)]
*  He didn't give any of these people a chance and opportunity to say whether they're from that gang or not. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=620.74s)]
*  That to me is just BS. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=627.74s)]
*  He's even defying the judges orders even during appeal. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=630.74s)]
*  That is just BS. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=635.74s)]
*  And we can't stand for that. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=636.82s)]
*  I'm a probationary worker at the NIH. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=639.82s)]
*  I'm a staff scientist. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=642.82s)]
*  All probationary workers weren't fired? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=643.82s)]
*  All probationary workers, no, they weren't fired. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=645.82s)]
*  But a good 40% or so were fired. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=647.82s)]
*  So I don't know the exact number. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=650.82s)]
*  And what does your sign say? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=652.82s)]
*  We just need to fund science and stop the cuts and stop funding billionaires and stop going for their actual purposes. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=653.82s)]
*  We want to really re-educate the population. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=661.9000000000001s)]
*  We need more funding in science. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=664.9000000000001s)]
*  New epidemics are going to start coming out unless we actually start putting more investment in research and more investment in public health. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=666.9000000000001s)]
*  I'm Rabbi Barra Elman. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=675.9000000000001s)]
*  I'm out here because we're on the break. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=676.9000000000001s)]
*  We have to stand up against this encroaching authoritarianism and fascism. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=680.9000000000001s)]
*  And I'm definitely scared for democracy. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=685.9000000000001s)]
*  And I'm definitely scared for democracy. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=688.98s)]
*  And we have to be in the streets, not just this week, but every week. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=691.98s)]
*  How do you feel about President Trump going after universities in the name of combating anti-Semitism? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=696.98s)]
*  I am so distressed and angry about that. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=703.98s)]
*  His weaponization of anti-Semitism is going to make Jews, is going to be dangerous for Jews. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=707.98s)]
*  But also it's a cynical use of this idea, which from his cabinet, which has so many people who's anti-Semitism has widely demonstrated, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=713.0600000000001s)]
*  for him to then try to claim that he's arguing on our behalf. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=724.0600000000001s)]
*  And it's also so completely blatantly false, you know, to someone protesting the war in Gaza is not endangering myself as a Jew. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=728.0600000000001s)]
*  And frankly, I also think the whole portrayal of the safety issue on campuses for Jews has been widely overrepresented [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=740.14s)]
*  and failing to talk about the safety of Muslims and Palestinians on campus. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=750.14s)]
*  So I'm a rabbi and I'm very active as a Jew. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=755.14s)]
*  And frankly, his weaponization of this, of anti-Semitism, I find grotesque and scary and wrong. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=760.14s)]
*  My name is Isaac. I made this sign to say 1825. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=769.22s)]
*  It's because everything that we have made, 200 years of progress since 1864, is being taken away. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=772.22s)]
*  They already went after women's rights. They already went after Latino rights. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=780.22s)]
*  They ain't going to stop until they come after everybody until we get thrown back to 19th century America again. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=784.22s)]
*  Need I say more? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=790.22s)]
*  What's your name? What's your sign? And why are you here? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=792.22s)]
*  My name is Susan. I'm here because this man is not fit to be president. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=795.3000000000001s)]
*  A president doesn't bail people to digest bleach and die in parking lots instead of getting health care, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=800.3000000000001s)]
*  instead of getting lunch, instead of defending our allies in Europe, defending democracy in the world. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=807.3000000000001s)]
*  What does your sign say? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=815.3000000000001s)]
*  My sign says no more tarot, no kings, and no third terms. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=817.3000000000001s)]
*  This is not how our president behaves. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=821.3000000000001s)]
*  No third terms! No third terms! [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=825.3000000000001s)]
*  Voices from the hands-off protest in New York City. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=830.3000000000001s)]
*  Estimates are up to 100,000 people marched on Saturday in the rain, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=833.3000000000001s)]
*  some of the million who marched around the globe. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=839.3000000000001s)]
*  You [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb1ZtY9ke4&t=855.22s)]
