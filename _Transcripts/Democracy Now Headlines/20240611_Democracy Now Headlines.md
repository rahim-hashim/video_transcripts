*  activist.
*  In the recording, Justice Alito agrees when Windsor says she hopes to, quote, return our
*  country to a place of godliness.
*  And Alito appears to rule out compromise between polarized political factions.
*  One side or the other is going to win.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, there can be a way of working, a way of living together peacefully, but it's different,
*  you know, because there are differences on fundamental things that really can't be compromised.
*  It really can't be compromised.
*  So it's not like we're going to split the difference.

*  feminists as feminazis, and boasts of her German heritage.
*  In May, Justice Alito told Congress he will not recuse himself from cases involving Donald

*  Lawson was a godfather of the civil rights movement, whom Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
*  once called the leading theorist and strategist of nonviolence in the world.
*  During the Korean War in the 50s, James Lawson was imprisoned for refusing to be drafted
*  into the U.S. Army.
*  He was later expelled from Vanderbilt University Divinity School for helping to organize lunch
*  counters in protest against segregation.
*  As a missionary in India, Lawson studied Mahatma Gandhi's principles of nonviolence.
*  He would go on to teach nonviolent civil disobedience tactics to rank-and-file activists in the
*  civil rights movement.
*  In 2020, Reverend Lawson was among speakers at the funeral of Congressman John Lewis at
*  the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.
*  We will not be quiet as long as our nation continues to be the most violent culture in
*  the history of humankind.
*  We will not be quiet as long as our economy is shaped not by freedom, but by plantation
*  capitalism that continues to cause domination and control rather than access and liberty
*  and equality for all.
*  Thank you.
