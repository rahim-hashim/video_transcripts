# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” August 7, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkIboxjC2Vk)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris campaigned in Philadelphia Tuesday with Tim
*  Walz just hours after Harris named the Minnesota governor as her running mate.
*  Before an audience of more than 12,000 people at Temple University, Governor Walz criticized
*  his Republican rivals Donald Trump and J.D.
*  Vance.
*  I gotta tell you, pointing out just an observation of mine that I made, I just have to say it.
*  You know it, you feel it.
*  These guys are creepy and, yes, just weird as hell.
*  That's what you see.
*  That's what you see.
*  Democrats, from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to New York Congressmember Alexandria
*  Ocasio-Cortez, praised Kamala Harris for selecting Tim Walz, who seemed by many to be a progressive
*  populist.
*  Walz was elected governor of Minnesota in 2018 after six terms in Congress, where he
*  served as the ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, a former public
*  school teacher and high school football coach who served 24 years in the National Guard.
*  As Governor, Walz has been praised by progressives for signing legislation to codify abortion
*  rights in Minnesota, provide free lunch to public school students and enact new gun control
*  laws.
*  Walz himself is a hunter and gun owner who was once endorsed by the NRA.
*  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro also spoke at the Harris rally in Philadelphia.
*  Shapiro had also been in the running to be Harris's vice presidential pick.
*  In news from Gaza, Israel's ordered Palestinians to leave the Beit Hanun area of Gaza City
*  ahead of what's expected to be a new Israeli offensive.
*  This comes as Israel's war on Gaza enters its 11th month.
*  Meanwhile, Hamas has announced Yahya Sinwar will become the new leader of the group's
*  political wing following Israel's assassination of Ismael Kania in Tehran last week.
*  Sinwar has served as Hamas's top leader in Gaza since 2017 and is credited with being
*  the mastermind on the October 7th attack on Israel.
*  One Hamas official told the BBC, quote,
*  "'They killed Hania, the flexible person who was open to solutions.
*  Now they have to deal with Sinwar and the military leadership,' unquote."
*  The news outlet 972 has revealed the Israeli army has been using Amazon's cloud services
*  to store massive amounts of surveillance information on the population of Gaza.
*  The news outlet also revealed Google and Microsoft have been providing the Israeli
*  military artificial intelligence tools to help in its war on Gaza.
*  A group of United Nations experts have condemned Israel for torturing Palestinians held inside
*  Israeli prisons.
*  In a statement, the experts wrote, quote,
*  "'Torture practices are irredeemably unlawful and constitute international crimes, yet form
*  part of the modus operandi of Israel's notorious detention and torture system,' they said.
*  The experts went on to write, quote,
*  "'These practices are intended to punish Palestinians for resisting occupation and
*  seek to destroy them individually and collectively,' unquote."
*  Meanwhile, the Israeli human rights group Petzalim has published a major new report
*  documenting how Israel's turned its jails into what Petzalim calls torture camps.
*  This is Sadiq Mikhaeli, Petzalim's spokesperson.
*  So, firstly, it's important to tell the stories of the victims, of people who have
*  been exposed to horrific abuse in Israel's prison system.
*  Additionally, this publication is meant to change the reality.
*  Therefore, Petzalim has called his appeal to all nations and to all relevant institutions,
*  including the International Criminal Court, to intervene, to end this reality and to
*  hold Israeli policymakers accountable for what is going on for the torture of Palestinian
*  prisoners in Israeli prison facilities.
*  Many Palestinians who have survived torture in Israeli prisons have spoken out after their
*  release.
*  This is Moazzaz Obayat, who was held for nine months in an Israeli prison.
*  The jail was very, very tough, as you can see in my situation.
*  The proof are in my photos that show me before and after the jail.
*  And that is enough to answer the question.
*  It is an unfair detention, and there is killing, and they torture us with metal sticks.
*  We were subject to all kinds of torture.
*  In Bangladesh, Nobel Peace Laureate Mohammed Yunus has been tapped to lead an interim government
*  After mass protests, forced Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee
*  to India.
*  Yunus had been a vocal critic of Hasina's government.
*  He's described her departure as Bangladesh's second Liberation Day.
*  Mohammed Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering the concept of microlending.
*  Thailand's Constitutional Court has ordered the disbandment of the country's largest
*  opposition party, claiming it violated election rules by campaigning against a law that outlaws
*  criticism of Thailand's royal family.
*  Some 150 lawmakers, with the youth-led move forward, must now transfer to a new political
*  party.
*  The party had won the most seats in last year's election but was blocked from taking power.
*  Senior United Nations officials are calling on the global community to do more to help
*  get humanitarian aid into Sudan after a famine was declared in at least one part of the Darfur
*  region following 15 months of war between the Sudanese military and the Rapid Support
*  Forces.
*  Edem Wasarnou of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs addressed the U.N.
*  Security Council Tuesday.
*  When famine happens, it means we are too late.
*  It means we did not do enough.
*  It means we, the international community, have failed.
*  This is an entirely man-made crisis and a shameful stain on our collective conscience.
*  In St. Louis, Missouri, county prosecutor Wesley Bell has defeated Congressmember Cory
*  Bush in a closely watched primary.
*  AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and its super PAC, spent $9 million
*  to take out Bush, who was one of the most progressive lawmakers in Congress.
*  The election comes just weeks after AIPAC helped defeat another progressive, New York
*  Congressmember Jamal Bowman.
*  Bush and Bowman have both been vocal critics of Israel's war on Gaza.
*  During a speech to supporters last night, Congressmember Bush decried the impact of
*  outside money on the race.
*  This was the second most expensive congressional race in our nation's history.
*  $19 million in counting.
*  And so that's how much they spent in this race, mostly far-right funded super PACs,
*  against the interests of the people of St. Louis, the people of Missouri's first.
*  They sought to divide us.
*  In California, a group of migrants jailed at two private immigration and customs enforcement
*  jails have relaunched a labor and hunger strike protesting dire conditions and demanding fair
*  wages for detained migrant workers.
*  The hunger strikers are also calling for the end to the excessive use of solitary confinement
*  at the Mesa Verde and Golden State Annex for the facilities to shut down.
*  Many of the detained migrants and asylum seekers are paid only a dollar a day to perform janitorial
*  duties and other jobs at the facilities, which are operated by the GEO Group.
*  The hunger strikers have reportedly faced heavy retaliation for taking part in the peaceful
*  protest.
*  In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, four hotel workers have been charged with felony murder in connection
*  with the death of Devonte Mitchell, a 43-year-old black father who died on June 30 after security
*  guards pinned him to the ground for over eight minutes outside a Hyatt Regency hotel.
*  An attorney for Mitchell's family, William Sutton, welcomed the charges, saying, quote,
*  "...what caused his death was the fact that four people beat him to death on the sidewalk
*  and jumped on top of him.
*  That's why he's dead," he said.
*  In media news, New York police have arrested Samuel Seligson, a local journalist, and charged
*  him with felony hate crime charges after he filmed pro-Palestinian activist hurling red
*  paint at the homes of top officials at the Brooklyn Museum.
*  Samuel Seligson's lawyer, Lena Witte, denounced the charges.
*  She said, quote, "...Samuel is being charged for alleged behavior that's protected by
*  the First Amendment and consistent with his job as a credentialed member of the press.
*  What's even more concerning, however, is that this member of the press is being charged
*  with a hate crime," unquote.
*  In other news about press freedom, prosecutors in Kansas have announced plans to charge the
*  former police chief in the city of Marion with obstruction of justice for his involvement
*  in a police raid last August targeting the town's local newspaper, The Marion County
*  Record, as well as the home of the paper's publisher, Eric Meyer.
*  His 98-year-old mother, Joan Meyer, who co-owned the newspaper, died of a heart attack a day
*  after the police raided their home.
*  And in Spain, climate activists spray-painted the mansion of the Argentine football star
*  Lionel Messi on the island of Ibiza.
*  The action was led by the group Futura Verital, which pointed to a report by Oxfam showing
*  that the wealthiest 1 percent of the world's population generate the same amount of carbon
*  emissions as the poorest two-thirds of humanity.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
