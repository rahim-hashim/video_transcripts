# Pulitzer Winner Nathan Thrall on Gaza, Israel's "System of Domination" and U.S. Complicity
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [May 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhAsiaWMAFc)
*  This news is funded by viewers like you.
*  Please support our work at democracynow.org.
*  In this special broadcast, we spend the hour with the Jerusalem-based journalist and writer
*  Nathan Thrall.
*  He just won the Pulitzer Prize for his most recent book, A Day in the Life of Abed Salama,
*  Anatomy of a Jerusalem Tragedy, which tells the story of Israel's occupation of the
*  West Bank through one family's tragedy.
*  The book was published October 3rd last year, just four days before Israel launched its
*  devastating assault on Gaza following the Hamas attack on October 7th.
*  Today we re-air two interviews with Nathan Thrall, one just after he won the Pulitzer
*  Prize this month and another interview recorded just after the book was published in October,
*  when he joined us with Abed Salama, the central figure of his book.
*  We begin with the interview Democracy Now!'s Nermeen Shaikh and I did with Nathan on May
*  9th, when he joined us from Berlin, Germany.
*  I began by asking him about the day's top story, President Biden's announcement that
*  the U.S. would halt the shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel.
*  You know, it's too little too late.
*  It is a step in the right direction, but the administration has said that it has not made
*  a final determination even about these paused weapons.
*  Biden said something very important.
*  It's wrong.
*  He also said something important months ago, which is that Israel is bombing indiscriminately,
*  and it's doing that indiscriminate bombing with U.S. weapons.
*  So it is very simple for Biden to end this and to have ended this a long time ago, and
*  it's not by threatening to pause a small portion of the weapons that are coming in.
*  Very early in this war, Israel could not continue to conduct it without resupply from the United
*  States.
*  The United States is fully complicit.
*  I am a U.S. taxpayer, and I am paying to kill Palestinian civilians.
*  So, Nathan, you've just mentioned, you know, ending the war, and there was a possibility
*  a ceasefire proposal earlier this week was accepted by Hamas in a move that surprised
*  many, including Israel, the ceasefire, which was negotiated, put together by Egypt and
*  Qatar.
*  And just days earlier, before Hamas accepted the ceasefire, on April 29th, Antony Blinken,
*  secretary of state, had said the proposal was, quote,
*  quite extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel and that Hamas was the only obstacle
*  to a ceasefire.
*  And Israel has now said that the proposal falls far short of its demands, but it's
*  continuing its negotiations in Cairo.
*  So if you could tell us what you think the main points of contention are and how much
*  that proposal changed from the one that Israel had initially approved and this one that Hamas
*  has agreed to.
*  So the fundamental obstacle in all of these ceasefire negotiations has been one central
*  issue, and that is that Hamas has demanded that the hostage exchange be accompanied by
*  an end to the war.
*  And Israel has refused.
*  It says it wants to get the hostages back and to do a prisoner exchange with Hamas and
*  then to continue pummeling Gaza.
*  Hamas and any other party in its place would be insane to accept such a deal.
*  It is the only leverage they have, and they cannot afford, to agree to a ceasefire, a
*  so-called ceasefire, that has them relinquish.
*  The only asset that they have that Israel wants, without a commitment that this is an
*  end to the war.
*  And so the fundamental issue is that Hamas says that the proposal that was given to it
*  does entail an end to the war, a full, sustainable calm that's guaranteed by the United States
*  and other mediators, and Israel says it rejects that.
*  And we have seen the text of the proposal that Hamas has accepted.
*  It is very close to what has been reported on all of the negotiations over the past week.
*  And we haven't seen the text that Israel says slightly differs in wording.
*  Can you talk about what's going on on the ground in Israel?
*  I mean, we just reported that last night hostage families clashed with police in Tel Aviv.
*  Two people were arrested.
*  One sister of a hostage was hospitalized.
*  Her mother said, end the war with Hamas.
*  How significant is this movement of hostage families and all their allies?
*  And is that putting pressure on Netanyahu?
*  Do you think he is going to actually engage in this wholesale ground assault on Ra'a?
*  The protests for a hostage exchange deal are a tremendous pressure on the government.
*  And if they grow in size, they will make the current coalition and Netanyahu sweat even more.
*  So they are very significant.
*  But as we have seen, they are not sufficient yet to have gotten Israel to agree to a ceasefire proposal.
*  And so far, Biden's limited threat has not been enough either.
*  So, Nathan, just to—you know, you have lived in Jerusalem, in Israel for many years, over a decade.
*  We last spoke to you just days before the October 7th attack.
*  If you could begin by talking about your response to Hamas' attack, and then what's unfolded
*  since, whether you were surprised by this, by either the scale of the Hamas attack, and
*  then, of course, what Israel has unleashed on Gaza.
*  The book tour that I was on began, you know, several days before October 7th, and I was
*  actually in the U.S. and on Democracy Now! with the title character, Abed Salama.
*  And he and I had returned from an event on Friday night, and we got the news late that
*  night as it was early morning, Saturday morning, in Israel-Palestine.
*  And we were both utterly shocked.
*  And we realized that the entire atmosphere that would be—first of all, the entire atmosphere
*  that his family is living in was about to change radically, and his entire community
*  was locked down immediately, and that the whole region was going to change, not to mention
*  the fact that there would be much more hostility toward the message of this book and that it
*  would be much more difficult for us to speak.
*  And indeed, many of our events were canceled after October 7th.
*  NERMEEN SHAIKH AL-ALI KHAN, JR.
*  And Nathan, could you situate—of course, you've just mentioned your book A Day in
*  the Life of Abed Salama, Anatomy of a Jerusalem Tragedy.
*  If you could talk about that book, what prompted it, and situate it in the context of what
*  we've seen in the last several months?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So, you know, the genesis of the book was really a place of frustration for me in working
*  on Israel-Palestine for many years, and watching as a heightened period of violence, like a
*  war in Gaza, immediately brings Israel-Palestine into the news.
*  It mobilizes students, and it gets the attention of the world, and leaders around the world
*  invariably call for a restoration of calm.
*  And what I wanted to write about in this book was that so-called calm, which is anything
*  but calm for Palestinians.
*  It's a system of domination that is extremely bureaucratic and elaborate and has lasted
*  for over half a century, and it is not going anywhere.
*  And so long as we are only seeing bloodshed, periodic bloodshed, and calling for a restoration
*  of the so-called calm that existed before that bloodshed, we are doomed to see that
*  bloodshed repeat.
*  And my intention was to choose something seemingly commonplace, like a bus accident involving
*  a group of Palestinian kindergartners, to describe this system of control and how ordinary
*  people, Palestinians and Jews, living in this area, both navigate through this system
*  that's controlling them and also implement and create this system.
*  And so the idea was to bring our attention to this deeply, deeply unjust system that
*  is fully supported by the United States and its Western allies.
*  What was happening, Nathan, in the West Bank prior to October 7th, and now the number of
*  people who've been killed since—killed and arrested, the Palestinians, since October
*  7th?
*  Prior to October 7th, we had already seen a spike in aggressive behavior from the army
*  and armed settlers in the West Bank.
*  The U.N. issued a small report at the end of September talking about unprecedented levels
*  of forced displacement of Palestinian Bedouin, and it said that roughly 1,100 Palestinian
*  Bedouin had been displaced in the last year and a half.
*  In the period immediately after October 7th, while all the eyes of the world were on Gaza,
*  an even greater number, more than 1,200, in just the weeks after October 7th, more than
*  1,200 Palestinian Bedouin were displaced in the West Bank.
*  There has been a surge in violence.
*  There have been hundreds of Palestinians who have been killed, huge numbers who have been
*  arrested, many of them held without trial or charge under so-called administrative
*  detention, which can be held for up to six months and then renewed indefinitely.
*  And in general, the restrictions on movement in the West Bank are the worst that they have
*  ever been since the occupation began.
*  It now takes me hours to get to locations that took me a half hour or 40 minutes in
*  the past.
*  All of the jobs, virtually all of them, in the settlements and in Israel, which so many
*  Palestinian extended families depend on—these are the higher-paying jobs for Palestinians
*  in the West Bank—those have all but disappeared.
*  And so Palestinians are strangled economically.
*  They are strangled in terms of their movement.
*  a few weeks ago to a dinner, an iftar dinner, at Abed Salama's home.
*  And his brother, who—his entire family lives in Anatta.
*  His brother lives in Ramallah.
*  And he said he had not left Ramallah since October 7th because the restrictions on movement
*  and also because of the unsafety, the settler attacks and all of the violence that is happening
*  in the West Bank while the world's attention is focused on Gaza.
*  And so, Nathan, explain.
*  You've said, why is—why are all the discussions about a one-state or two-state solution as
*  the possible resolution to this?
*  Why you think the discussions around a two-state or one-state solution are the wrong discussions
*  to be happening?
*  You know, these conversations are premised on the notion that Israel eventually has to
*  choose.
*  It has to either give the millions of Palestinians living under its control without basic civil
*  rights.
*  It has to give them either citizenship, with equality, or statehood.
*  And so many people in the diplomatic community would like to have, as they have been having,
*  for decades, debates about what a two-state outcome should look like, whether there should
*  be two states or one state or confederation or what have you.
*  And all of that is an enormous distraction from the reality on the ground, because the
*  fact is, of the matter is, Israel does not have to choose between two states and one
*  state.
*  It doesn't have to choose between giving Palestinians sovereignty or citizenship.
*  It has a third option, which is to continue on the path that it's going down, the path
*  that it's going down is slow, de facto annexation of the West Bank, an absorption of the West
*  Bank settlements in Area C, a takeover of Palestinian land, and a constriction of Palestinians
*  into small, walled-off or fenced-off communities, like the town of Anatta, where my book takes
*  place, or like Gaza.
*  And so, rather than focusing on the reality, which is a movement in the opposite direction
*  of either two states or equality in one state, but rather a deepening of the system of control
*  that leading human rights organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch
*  and the U.N. Human Rights Council and Al-Haq and B'Tselem have all described as a system
*  rather than addressing that system, Israel would very much like for everybody to debate
*  what would be the ideal outcome, what is the future or utopia that we would all like.
*  And let's only address this structural inequality, this systematic domination, once we've all
*  agreed that we've landed on the right, perfect outcome.
*  Nathan, before we go, we were remiss in not congratulating you on the Pulitzer Prize this
*  week for your book.
*  When you came here, it was—
*  Thank you very much.
*  It was two days before October 7th.
*  Your book had just come out.
*  You had events up the wazoo.
*  So many of them were canceled.
*  And you're in Berlin right now, in Germany.
*  Germany has been a remarkable scene, where you have German police arresting Jewish protesters
*  saying that they cannot criticize Israel.
*  What has happened with your events from Germany to the United States as you raise questions
*  about Israel's war on Gaza?
*  In Germany, I had an event that was to take place on Tuesday in Frankfurt that was canceled
*  at the very last minute by the Union International Club in Frankfurt.
*  And none of the people who canceled the event had read the book or knew a thing about it.
*  And none of them had or provided any substantive reason for the cancellation.
*  And the same thing was happening to me in the United States.
*  And the reason, in Germany, is everybody is afraid of being accused of anti-Semitism.
*  And what they're really being accused of is not anti-Semitism, but criticism of Israel
*  that is described as anti-Semitism.
*  And Israel has spent years—Israel and its allies have spent years, in the United States
*  and in Germany, putting forward a definition of anti-Semitism that includes criticism of
*  Israel, entirely legitimate criticism of Israel, and trying to get around our basic democratic
*  commitment to free speech by describing a speech that is entirely legitimate as anti-Semitic.
*  And so that's what's happened here.
*  And who, of course, is the close ally of Israel, the most pro-Israel force here in Germany?
*  It's the far-right party.
*  As we see elsewhere, ethno-nationalists love Israel as a model for the kind of place they
*  want to become, an ethno-national state that will dominate over people who are not like them.
*  In this holiday special, we spend the rest of the hour speaking with Nathan Thrall and
*  Abed Salama.
*  Democracy Now!'s Juan González and I spoke to them in early October, just after the publication
*  of Nathan's remarkable book, A Day in the Life of Abed Salama, Anatomy of a Jerusalem
*  Tragedy.
*  The book looks at the devastating reality for Palestinians living under Israeli occupation
*  through the lens of a Palestinian father.
*  Abed Salama lives in Anatta, a segregated Palestinian neighborhood on the outskirts
*  of Jerusalem that's surrounded on three sides by the 26-foot-high Israeli separation
*  wall.
*  Many refer to it as the apartheid wall.
*  In February of 2012, tragedy struck Abed's family.
*  His five-year-old son, Milad, died in a fiery bus crash during a school field trip to a
*  theme park.
*  Abed's quest to find out what happened to his son was immediately hindered because he
*  was a Palestinian living on the wrong side of the separation wall.
*  He held the wrong ID to pass Israeli military checkpoints and didn't have the right papers
*  to enter the city of Jerusalem.
*  Nathan Thrall, who lives in Jerusalem, wrote about this tragedy in a remarkable 2021 essay
*  for the New York Review of Books.
*  Juan González and I spoke to Abed Salama and Nathan Thrall and aired the interview
*  on October 5th, that was two days before Hamas's October 7th attack on southern Israel and
*  the start of Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  Nathan began by discussing why he wrote about Abed Salama and the tragedy of his family.
*  You know, this event is every parent's worst nightmare and an awful, awful tragedy under
*  any circumstances.
*  But it was made so much worse by the unique circumstances in which it took place, by the
*  fact that the victims were Palestinian, that it took place on a road that is controlled
*  by Israel, patrolled by Israeli police, but on the other side of a separation wall, a
*  six-foot-high concrete wall that separates and segregates tens of thousands of Palestinians
*  from Jerusalem, born and raised in Jerusalem, residents of the same city I live in, but
*  who are cut off from the city that they were born and raised in, specifically because of
*  their ethnic identity.
*  And these people live in the same city as me, but they live in entirely different existence.
*  And the parents of the kids on this bus live in a walled ghetto, encircled on three sides
*  by this separation wall, and a fourth side by a different wall that runs in the middle
*  of a segregated road, famously called the apartheid road.
*  And inside that walled ghetto, which sits just underneath the manicured grounds of Israel's
*  most prestigious university, you can look down on it from Hebrew University down onto
*  this ghetto, with trash being burned in the street because the municipal services are
*  nonexistent there, with no sidewalks, roads in total disrepair.
*  When I drive into this area to visit Abed and other families there, I have to pull off
*  to the side just to let a bus pass on the main artery for tens of thousands of people.
*  I'm rolling down my window and pulling in my side mirror to let a regular bus pass
*  me.
*  And this is just the everyday reality of all of these people.
*  They receive virtually no services from the city that they pay taxes to, and they are
*  forced to prove that they have maintained their residency in the right part of this
*  enclave, or else Israel will strip them of their blue ID, which allows them to travel
*  in and out of Jerusalem, and they live in terror of having this blue ID taken away from
*  them.
*  Some of the parents in this area have green IDs, some have blue, they're all from the
*  same families, and the outcome for them on this day was very different.
*  There were real consequences to having a different colored permit on that day.
*  Abed was one of the parents who wasn't able to go and look for his kid in Jerusalem when
*  he was told that that's where his boy was.
*  And other parents did.
*  There were bystanders, because the emergency services came so very late, all of the kids
*  had been evacuated by just ordinary people in private cars before the first Israeli emergency
*  service provider arrived.
*  And those people themselves drove off in all kinds of different directions, depending on
*  what kind of color ID they had and whether they could pass through a checkpoint.
*  And there was total chaos.
*  The parents didn't know where their own children were.
*  And so, this awful event allowed me, in telling the story, to describe the entire elaborate
*  system of segregation and subjugation and apartheid in which all of these people live.
*  Abed, I hate to take you back to that day, but it is such an important story for people
*  to understand.
*  Introduce us to your little boy, Milad, and talk about what happened that day.
*  Hi, everyone.
*  My son, Milad, he was only five years old.
*  He was a cute boy, a cool boy, funny boy, loved life.
*  So the day before the accident, in the night, he said, Father, I want to buy some sweets
*  and chocolates for my trip.
*  It is the first trip with the school.
*  So I took him to a grocery around supermarket, and he buy his things and the favorite chocolate,
*  Kindergarten and juice.
*  Then we go back home.
*  He was very excited to join his friends on the journey and the trip.
*  So we got to sleep earlier.
*  This day I was planning to go to Jericho for a business with my cousin.
*  The weather in the morning was very stormy.
*  So I got up.
*  I didn't see Milad when his mother prepared him and put him in the bus, in the car, to
*  the school.
*  So after an hour, my cousin come and we took his car on our way to Jericho.
*  Then I received a phone call from my nephew.
*  He asked me if Milad in the bus, in the school, in the bus to the trip.
*  I said, I told him, yes, he is there.
*  He said, Uncle, there is an accident in Jabba Road.
*  The bus crashed.
*  So we went, we changed our way from Jericho to Jabba Road in that stormy weather.
*  When we arrived before the accident, the place of the accident, before there was, there is
*  a military, Israeli military checkpoint.
*  They closed the street before.
*  They didn't allow us to pass with the car.
*  So I jumped out of the car and started running to the place of the accident.
*  On my way up, it's raining and stormy weather, military jeep passed on me.
*  So I wanted to stop them to take me with them.
*  They didn't take me.
*  So I continued my way to the place of the accident running, up head.
*  So when I received there, there was nothing.
*  I saw the bus crashed on the side and a big trailer on the other side of the street.
*  So I started asking about what happened to the kids, where are the kids?
*  Everyone, there was many, many people around.
*  There was only one fire truck.
*  I didn't see any ambulances at that time.
*  I saw only civilian police officer from the PA.
*  So the main thing at that time, I wanted to know what happened to the kids, where are
*  they?
*  I started searching and asking, where are the kids?
*  So somebody told me that they took them to—some of them took to a DSA in Karim Hospital in
*  East Jerusalem.
*  Others told me they took them to a military space, Israeli military space, in Iran.
*  And others told me maybe they took them to the hospital in Ramallah.
*  So I asked—I met two guys from Jenin.
*  I thought—I asked them to take me to Ramallah Hospital.
*  I didn't—they are strangers.
*  I didn't know them.
*  They allowed to take me.
*  And then they took me to the hospital.
*  When I arrived there, it was very crowded.
*  There were many, many people there, the parents of the victims and police and ambulances,
*  media.
*  It was very, very crowded.
*  And I started to search in the building of the hospital.
*  So I asked Dr. Ruiz in the reception about what's—I'm looking for my son, Milad.
*  He was in the accident.
*  When she looked at the list, she didn't find his name.
*  She told me his name is not in the list of the—in this bus.
*  So I started to search in the hospital rooms.
*  I didn't meet—I didn't found him.
*  I met other parents who are from our neighborhood.
*  I know him.
*  They find—already find their kids.
*  They was injured.
*  And I asked them if they say—if they saw my son or their sons know anything about Milad.
*  Everybody was busy in his own case.
*  So everybody said, no, we didn't find him.
*  So here I started my—started to search where to search.
*  I searched again in the same hospital.
*  I didn't find him.
*  Then somebody told me maybe they took him to Hadassah in Karim Hospital in Jerusalem.
*  I didn't have a permit to pass the checkpoints to Jerusalem.
*  They didn't allow us to pass because I have a green ID, Palestinian ID.
*  So I called the cousin of mine who have blue ID and asked him to search in Hadassah in
*  Karim.
*  After maybe one hour, two hours, he called me back.
*  He said, I searched all the hospitals there.
*  Milad is not there.
*  So after six or seven hours, everyone from the parents find his son injured or safe,
*  except me and seven other six families.
*  So a doctor from there came to me, and he said, You didn't find your son yet, and
*  we have to take some blood from you to make DNA tests.
*  I asked him why.
*  He said we have six bodies for small children and the body of the teacher, Bernd.
*  So he asked me also to call my wife and my son Adam to come to the hospital to take blood
*  from them for the test, DNA test.
*  I called them.
*  It took more than an hour to receive to the hospital.
*  So they took a blood from us.
*  My wife was shocked.
*  I was crying.
*  At the same time, I was looking at her face and my son Adam's face.
*  There was shock.
*  She did cry until now.
*  I think she's still in shock.
*  Nathan Thrall, you write about that dangerous road that Milad would die on.
*  You said everyone knew how quickly Israeli forces would descend on a West Bank road the
*  moment a Palestinian kid started throwing stones at Israeli soldiers or settlers.
*  Yet the soldiers at the checkpoints, the troops at Ramah base, the fire trucks at the settlements
*  nearby, they had all done nothing, letting the bus burn for more than half an hour.
*  If you can talk about this, this architecture of separation, of apartheid that led to the
*  beginning, so that what we hear in Abed's story is not just an unfortunate bus crash,
*  but so much of which could have been prevented.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, the particular series of events that unfolded that day were entirely predictable
*  because of this system of segregation and neglect that exists in this area.
*  And there had been people who had warned of it.
*  There had been previous incidents where tragedy had struck on the other side of this wall.
*  And Israeli services were greatly delayed or even prevented from coming to the area.
*  And so, you know, what the book is showing is not, you know, the passage that you mentioned.
*  Those were the words of a man who was screaming at Israeli soldiers that morning after he
*  had almost single-handedly rescued dozens of children.
*  He entered a burning bus repeatedly and pulled kids out of this bus and saved dozens of them.
*  And he was in a state of shock at the end of this.
*  And he was screaming at every person, but particularly at the Israelis, but also the
*  Palestinian emergency service providers at the scene.
*  And he said those words to an Israeli, an Israeli soldier, and he was then summarily
*  beaten for saying what he said and spent several days in the hospital afterward.
*  But the point is not that the Israelis who were at the checkpoint just next to the accident
*  and didn't come or at the military base and took just next to the accident and took
*  forever to come.
*  The point isn't that anybody made a deliberate choice to observe a burning bus of kindergartners
*  and do nothing.
*  It's that this entire system was set up to ensure that there would be a very delayed
*  response that these people live in utter neglect and nobody cares about them.
*  You also write in the book about the small scorched backpacks on the road after the accident.
*  If you can talk more about the effect of this system on children, which is the power
*  of this, and let me ask, is really your decision to use this example, this bus crash, the horror
*  of the deaths of the children who died in this fiery crash, to show us what's happening
*  in Palestine and Israel?
*  Yeah, it was a very deliberate choice to choose an incident that, although horrific, is an
*  incident that takes place, the kind of thing that takes place all over the world, is a
*  terrible car accident or a terrible bus crash, and to show what it means to be in a terrible
*  accident or a terrible bus crash, and to show what it means for this seemingly ordinary
*  event to take place in this particular place under this system, because the point is that
*  the system itself, the policies that are in place, the wall that encircles these communities,
*  the desire to demographically engineer Jerusalem so that it would have the maximum number of
*  Jews and the minimum number of Palestinians and to keep for Israel the maximum amount
*  of land, and the entire route of this wall, the way that it snakes around this community
*  and encircles it and traps it in this ghetto, all of that is dictated by this racist logic.
*  And I didn't want to choose to tell a story that would be exceptionalized and that we
*  would look at some particular act of violence and act about the perpetrators and the victims
*  and why this event took place on this day. I wanted to show the system that is crushing
*  people every day, and it's brought into sharp relief on the worst day of these people's
*  lives, but they are suffering all of these obstacles and all of this pain from this system
*  day in and day out.
*  Nathan, you also describe in your book not only the total disregard and neglect of the
*  Israeli services to the victims of the accident, you also talk about a week later a left-wing
*  television reporter, Israeli television reporter, did a story not so much about the accident
*  itself, but how shocked he was at the reaction of the, of residents, of Israeli residents
*  around the area, the accident.
*  That's right. Several weeks after the accident, an Israeli journalist, a TV journalist, decided
*  to create a feature about something that had shocked him to his core, which was that the
*  many, many Israelis on the day of the accident, young ones in particular, were writing how
*  happy they were that these children had died. And they were, what shocked the journalist,
*  his name is Arik Weiss, what shocked him the most was that people did it without hiding
*  their identity. They felt so comfortable writing racist posts and celebrating the death
*  of innocent five-year-olds without masking their true names. And so he decided to write
*  and to create a feature, a TV feature, about these kids, but also who wrote the posts,
*  some of them, most of them were kids, I think. And really what his aim was, was to, as he
*  says, to show a mirror to his own society and to ask, how did we get to a point where
*  so many young people feel that this is acceptable and aren't afraid even of being caught expressing
*  these views. And they go on, he finds many of the people who posted on that day, and
*  they go on to proudly reiterate the kinds of things that they had written that morning.
*  And the accident was now just over 10 years ago, and we see that the trends that this
*  reporter was highlighting have only gotten worse. And we see, you know, senior ministers
*  in the Israeli government who are openly racist. And, you know, when you poll young Israelis,
*  you see they have extremely right-wing views and racist views. So it was a prescient report
*  that he made.
*  Abed Salama, what has been the response in your community, in your family, to Nathan
*  focusing on this tragedy and the loss of Milad in his book, A Day in the Life of Abed Salama?
*  In the beginning, my family refused, especially my wife. She refused to talk about, until
*  now, she refused to talk about the accident and to talk about Milad, our son, until now.
*  So I took this responsibility alone, and I decided to share our tragedy with Nathan,
*  maybe for two reasons. The first one is because I loved all the time to talk about my son.
*  When I remember him and I started to speak about him, about what he was doing, about
*  his laughing, his playing, his drawing. So I loved that, because this is the main reason.
*  The second reason, Nathan told me, I will make from your case, from this accident, I
*  will write an article. In the beginning, he wrote it as an article, not a book. And I
*  wrote it as an article, and this will help your community, Palestinian community. This
*  article will help them to show the Americans and the people around the world how the Israeli
*  government treats you as Palestinians. So when he wrote the article, and I read it,
*  and we receive many important comments from around the world, that it is a very strong
*  article. He said, I want to make it as a book. If you didn't mind, of course I didn't
*  remind you from the beginning, as I told you, I want to spend many times with you, and I
*  want to spend many times with a person like Nathan talking about my son. When I start
*  to talk about him, I feel that his spirit is behind me, around me. And this time I feel
*  Milad sitting with us here. So I love that. I think, and I hope the book will make some
*  changes and help us as Palestinians to live our lives as all the people around the world.
*  This is what I hope to. Everyone, every father, every responsible in his family, he wanted
*  only to live in peace. He wanted to live in peace. He wanted to live in peace. He wanted
*  to be a son, to grow up his children in peace and safe. And as Palestinians, we miss these
*  things. When you go out from your house, or your son go out from his house, you didn't
*  expect him to come back safe. This is what happened. Because of that, I am happy to share
*  my story with Nathan. I'm here in New York or in America. This is my best time here.
*  So the life here is different. I can see the people here running and playing, working,
*  enjoying, and the kids also. People here taking their dogs and playing, playing, playing,
*  dogs around in parks. We miss these things. I want to tell you something. I have a dog,
*  a bit of a dog in my house. I put him on the roof. They all know the bit of a dog is a
*  strong dog. So I'm afraid to take him down to walk with him in the street, because the
*  street is crowded and it's many, many people. We lived in 130,000 people. We were in the
*  130,000 people lived in a small square like many. As Nathan told you, it's a small place
*  for 103,000 people live there. I can't walk with my dog in the street. I'm afraid to attack
*  somebody or somebody here or there. When I saw the people here in America walking with
*  their dogs and playing with their kids outside in parking, actually, honestly, I feel jealous.
*  I want this life for my children, for my grandchildren also. I hope if anyone from the American
*  government hear me, I hope if you want, we want only just the kids. I hope that the kids
*  will be happy. This is what we want as Palestinians in the Palestinian Authority.
*  And Nathan, let me ask you. You first wrote this essay in 2021 that appeared in the New
*  York Review of Books, headlined, A Day in the Life of Abed Salama, One Man's Quest
*  to Find His Son Lays Bare, The Reality of Palestinian Life Under Israeli Rule. The article
*  was 50 pages. It in itself was a book. And then you expanded it to the book, the main
*  title, The Same, A Day in the Life of Abed Salama. What did you learn as you expanded
*  this investigation? And we've turned to you for analysis in Jerusalem, what's happening
*  there. What surprised you most and what affected you most as you went on this journey with
*  Abed?
*  The book shares just a page or so of text with the article, despite sharing the same
*  title. And the aim of the book is entirely different than the article. The aim of the
*  book is to immerse people viscerally in the lives of Palestinians living on the other
*  side of this wall, and to make them feel and understand what that life is like. And one
*  of the things that struck me more than anything as I was working on it was how much pain there
*  is just beneath the surface in every single Palestinian family. And the book has Abed's
*  name in the title, but it tells the story of many different characters whose lives collided
*  on this day. And one of the themes of the book is the degree to which this oppressive
*  system touches the most intimate decisions in people's lives. And the book is about
*  the degree to which this oppressive system touches the most intimate decisions in people's
*  lives. I tell a story of Abed's early romance and his first marriage, and at one point he
*  has a job that takes him into the center of Jerusalem, and he is afraid of losing his
*  access to the city because of his green-colored ID. And he and many other people at that time
*  went and sought out wives who had blue IDs or Israeli citizenship. They were choosing
*  marriage partners in order to keep their freedom of movement, in order to keep their jobs.
*  This is the degree to which this huge oppressive system affects ordinary people. I tell the
*  story of a woman, a doctor named Huda Dahbur, who happened to be on her way to treat Bedouin.
*  She worked for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, and she was on her way with her
*  medical team to go and treat a group of Bedouin not too far from the site of the accident,
*  and she stumbled on this horrific site, and she pulled over with her team and helped
*  to rescue children from the bus. And I tell part of Huda's story. Huda had a boy, a
*  teenage boy, who quite naturally threw stones at occupying forces in his town, outside his
*  school, who were harassing him and other students every day. And at 1.30 in the morning,
*  Israeli jeeps show up and bang on her door and say to Huda, we're here for your son.
*  Hadi. And she can do absolutely nothing. She stands there with tears running down her face,
*  realizing that the jaws of this state are going to come and snatch her boy and take
*  him away to who knows where, and she spent over 10 days looking just to find what cell
*  he was in, where he was located. And that feeling of utter powerlessness, that feeling
*  of utter powerlessness, that is one that every Palestinian family feels, powerlessness
*  to protect your own children. So, you know, the theme for me, what was most striking as
*  I talked to these families, is how much pain there was and how much, you know, the pain
*  of being in a prison. How much the state had crept into every single facet of their lives.
