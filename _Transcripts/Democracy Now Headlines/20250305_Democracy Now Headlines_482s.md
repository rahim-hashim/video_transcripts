Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress discussed the Middle East without any mention of Palestinians. This comes as Trump has called for ethnic cleansing of Gaza and posted an AI-generated video depicting Gaza as a resort town with a golden statue of Trump. Congressmember Bonnie Watson Coleman attended the speech with her guest Dr. Adam Hamawy, an Army veteran and reconstructive surgeon who recently volunteered at a Gaza hospital. “The whole issue of Gaza, with the exception of the president wanting to make it a spa for millionaires, was being overlooked at a time when the infrastructure is absolutely devastated, the people are devastated,” says Watson Coleman.

*  surgeon, Army veteran who recently volunteered in Gaza. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=21.2s)]
*  He also provided lifesaving care to now-democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois when she [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=24.64s)]
*  was wounded in the Iraq War in 2004, had her legs blown off. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=32.0s)]
*  President Trump did not address the devastation in Gaza during his address, but promised to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=38.28s)]
*  bring peace and prosperity to the region. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=42.88s)]
*  In the Middle East, we're bringing back our hostages from Gaza. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=51.0s)]
*  the Abraham Accords. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=56.6s)]
*  And now we're going to build on that foundation to create a more peaceful and prosperous future [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=59.6s)]
*  for the entire region. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=73.0s)]
*  President Trump didn't mention Palestinians, but we're joined right now by Congresswoman [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=75.28s)]
*  Bonnie Watson Coleman and Dr. Adam Hamawi. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=79.32s)]
*  We welcome you both to Democracy Now! [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=83.96s)]
*  Congresswoman, it's great to have you back. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=86.0s)]
*  We had you on last, when Trump was president, before. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  If you can talk about why you invited Adam, Dr. Hamawi, and your response overall to Trump's [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  address. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=100.72s)]
*  Well, I invited Dr. Hamawi because he has been such a humanitarian in this space. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=102.4s)]
*  And I felt that with all the distractions with the millions of EO's that the president [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=109.72s)]
*  was putting out in the proposals and the doge and the distraction from this and distraction [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=117.36s)]
*  from that, that the whole issue of Gaza, with the exception of the president wanting to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=122.64s)]
*  make it a spa for millionaires, was being overlooked at a time when the infrastructure [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=128.44s)]
*  is absolutely devastated, the people are devastated, they're hungry, they're in need of so much, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=135.44s)]
*  including a place to live, a place to educate, and hospitals to take care of their needs, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=141.52s)]
*  that we should not allow this administration to get away with not saying anything that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=148.72s)]
*  is helpful to the Palestinian people who live in that area. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=155.4s)]
*  Now, with regard to the president's speech in general, I was more taken back by the fact [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=159.28s)]
*  that he didn't talk about important things that bring down the cost of living for Americans. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=166.8s)]
*  He didn't talk about ensuring that they had their Medicaid. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  He didn't talk about their having access to education other than as it related to trans [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=176.52s)]
*  and homosexuals and things of that nature. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  He harped on those things that are most divisive. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  He harped on those things that created greater division among us. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  And he spoke to half-truths in the majority of his speech. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=194.72s)]
*  It was probably the longest speech and one of the worst speeches I've ever heard from [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=199.44s)]
*  a president to the joint house. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  And it was kind of sickening, actually, to have to keep reminding people of his false [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  statements or the fact that he's ignoring the issues that are important to Americans, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=213.64s)]
*  which have to do with what happens under their roofs, in their kitchens, in their bedrooms, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=220.2s)]
*  in their bathrooms, access to health care, education, housing. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  All of those things are important and necessary to our citizens. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=230.56s)]
*  And he just spent his time creating greater division, talking about the border, trying [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=237.64s)]
*  to create another group of people to hate in the trans-genders. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=243.44s)]
*  He comes from a very negative perspective and he comes from a very untruthful perspective. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=248.72s)]
*  And it's quite disgusting to see that and to experience that out of the president of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=256.84s)]
*  the United States. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=262.24s)]
*  And finally, there's nothing that he's doing to create peace in either Ukraine or in Gaza, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  and we need to hold him accountable. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=272.64s)]
*  Our safety and security is impacted by how we treat our allies and how we treat those [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=276.2s)]
*  who are least among us. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=282.28s)]
*  And he doesn't seem to care. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  He seems to care about bowing down to Putin and being a lapdog for Elon Musk, who just [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=286.0s)]
*  about stealing and making more money from government. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=294.24s)]
*  So to me, last night was disgusting. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=297.2s)]
*  I'd like to bring in Dr. Hamoui. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=300.96s)]
*  Could you talk about how little Trump—you've been in many war zones as a doctor, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=302.88s)]
*  and you've never seen the kind of destruction you saw in Gaza, yet Trump hardly mentioned [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=309.68s)]
*  the war that has stunned the world for the last year and a half. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=315.68s)]
*  Well, you know, he kind of skirted the issue. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  He touts that he's being a peacemaker, yet at the same time he's talking about ethnic [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  cleansing in Gaza. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  He didn't mention at all that yesterday that Israel's breaking the ceasefire currently. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  It's basically stopped all humanitarian aid. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=335.68s)]
*  There was multiple drone strikes yesterday. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=338.56s)]
*  So that wasn't mentioned at all. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=341.12s)]
*  So when he talks about making peace, it doesn't seem like he actually follows through with [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=343.36s)]
*  it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  All he does is, again, looking for his own benefit. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=348.96s)]
*  And I don't think much has changed from what was previously there in place. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=353.68s)]
*  I mean, the situation is still horrible. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=357.52s)]
*  There's still a tremendous amount of devastation that we have caused there. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=361.36s)]
*  We are still supplying bombs to Israel. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=367.36s)]
*  So when we talk about cutting off aid to the Ukraine, we're still spending Americans' [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=370.24s)]
*  money for bombs for killing children in Gaza and now in the West Bank as well. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=374.8s)]
*  None of that was mentioned at all. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  In this last minute, we have Dr. Hamawi. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=382.24s)]
*  You've talked about the devastation of the impact of the cuts to USAID and also Dr. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=386.64s)]
*  Abu Safiyah, who headed Kamal Adwan, a pediatrician, who is still being held by Israel. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=394.88s)]
*  Any thoughts or do you know about his whereabouts? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't know about his whereabouts. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=406.56s)]
*  And he is, again, an example of the arbitrary way that they take prisoners and hold them [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=408.4s)]
*  hostage without any proper care at all. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  They have no concern for international law. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=423.2s)]
*  They've been targeting doctors and nurses since the beginning of war. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=425.2s)]
*  Over 500 healthcare workers have been killed or taken prisoner since the start of this. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=428.96s)]
*  So a complete disregard for any international norms or rules of war. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=434.88s)]
*  And with the prisoner exchanges that were supposed to happen, multiple times they stated [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=441.03999999999996s)]
*  that they would probably release them, but that has not come through. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=446.88s)]
*  We're going to have to leave it there, but I want to thank you for being with us. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=452.24s)]
*  And of course, we'll continue to cover this issue as we do every day. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=454.96s)]
*  Dr. Adam Hamawi, a reconstructive surgeon and Army veteran who volunteered in Gaza, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=459.35999999999996s)]
*  and New Jersey Democratic Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=466.08s)]
*  They both attended President Trump's joint session address. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTq79wcIudY&t=469.59999999999997s)]
