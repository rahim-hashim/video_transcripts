# Top U.S. & World Headlines — August 2, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [August 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMQW5k4EaqY)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, former Marine Paul Whelan and Russian-American
*  journalist Alsu Komersheva landed in the U.S. late Thursday after being freed from Russian
*  custody in an historic prisoner exchange, the largest between Russia and Western nations
*  since the Cold War era.
*  The three were welcomed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland by President Biden, Vice President
*  Kamala Harris and their family members, who rushed to embrace them as they stepped out
*  of the plane.
*  Biden spoke earlier in the day, surrounded by the released prisoners' relatives.
*  — Three American citizens and one American green card holder.
*  All four have been imprisoned unjustly in Russia.
*  Paul for nearly six years, Vladimir since 2022, Evan since March of 2023 and Alsu since
*  October of 2023.
*  Russian authorities arrested them, convicted them in show trials and sentenced them to
*  long prison terms, with absolutely no legitimate reason whatsoever, none.
*  — Russian-British dissident Vladimir Karamurza, who has a U.S. green card, was also released
*  in the swap, what was not on the U.S.-bound flight.
*  In total, 16 political prisoners were freed, including human rights defenders and journalists.
*  Five of those released were German.
*  In return, eight Russians were released from prisons in the United States, Germany, Norway,
*  Slovenia and Poland.
*  Among them, Vadim Krasikov, a convicted Russian assassin who is in German custody after the
*  killing of a Chechen dissident in Berlin.
*  We'll have more on this story later in the broadcast.
*  We'll speak with Katrina van der Hove, publisher of The Nation.
*  In Qatar, thousands have gathered for the funeral of Hamas's assassinated political
*  leader Ismail Khaniya in Doha.
*  This is Heva Ghazi, a mourner who is originally from Egypt.
*  — We came here today to provide moral support to the Palestinian people and the Arab people,
*  to bid farewell to the body of Ismail Khaniya.
*  He is considered a leader of the resistance against Israel.
*  He was the essence of the negotiations.
*  He was the main side of the negotiations, speaking on behalf of the resistance.
*  His assassination has for sure assassinated the negotiations.
*  — Protests and others, and other gatherings, are also taking place today across the Arab
*  and Muslim world.
*  — Israel summoned Turkey's deputy ambassador after the Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv lowered
*  its flag to half-mast in a tribute to Khaniya.
*  President Joe Biden said late Thursday Khaniya's killing had not helped the situation in Gaza
*  and the region.
*  Meanwhile, new reports say an Israeli bomb that was smuggled into a Tehran guest house
*  two months ago, then remotely detonated on Wednesday, is to blame for Khaniya's death.
*  The Hamas leader was in Tehran to attend the inauguration of Iran's new president.
*  Also in Doha, Al Jazeera journalists gathered at the media network's headquarters to condemn
*  Israel's targeted killing of their colleagues Ismail al-Ghul and Rami al-Rifi while they
*  were reporting in Gaza on Wednesday.
*  Al Jazeera refuted Israeli claims that it targeted al-Ghul because he was a Hamas operative.
*  Al Jazeera said the claim, quote, highlights Israel's long history of fabrications and
*  false evidence used to cover up its heinous crimes, unquote.
*  In Gaza, at least 15 Palestinians were killed in another Israeli strike on a school sheltering
*  displaced people today, as the official death toll nears 40,000.
*  The true death toll is certainly much higher.
*  In election news, as the Democratic National Convention kicked off its virtual roll call
*  vote on Thursday, the uncommitted national movement is calling on the Democratic Party
*  to allow Dr. Tanya Hajjahsen, who volunteered in Gaza to take the stage at the DNC later
*  this month.
*  Dr. Tanya Hajjahsen, pediatric intensive care doctor, has been outspoken about the horrors
*  she witnessed treating war victims in Gaza.
*  She's one of 30 delegates representing the uncommitted movement after its successful
*  campaign got over 700,000 primary voters to cast ballots for uncommitted instead of
*  Joe Biden to protest U.S. support for Israel's war.
*  Dr. Hajjahsen appeared on Democracy Now! in March after she returned from two weeks in
*  Gaza.
*  This is not a humanitarian crisis.
*  This is the worst of what humanity is capable of, and it's entirely all manmade.
*  And when you witness it firsthand, it's an unbearable injustice.
*  Democracy Now! will be in Chicago with daily coverage of the Democratic National Convention,
*  expanded to two hours daily, from August 19th to August 23rd.
*  In other election news, progressive leaders are throwing their weight behind Missouri
*  Congressmember Cori Bush ahead of her primary election next Tuesday, as the pro-Israel lobby
*  group AIPAC is throwing millions of dollars to smear Bush and fund her challenger, St.
*  Louis County prosecuting attorney Wesley Bell.
*  AIPAC's super political action committee, United Democracy Project, already unseated
*  another squad member, New York's Jamal Bowman, earlier this primary season.
*  Congressman Bush has been an outspoken defender of Palestinian rights and against Israel's
*  war on Gaza.
*  Dozens of Jewish activists and allies staged a mock press conference and protest Wednesday
*  at the White Plains headquarters of Atlas Air to call out the company's role in fueling
*  the war on Gaza.
*  Activists posed as Atlas executives and handed out flyers designed to look like marketing
*  materials but that read, Atlas Air, We Fly for Genocide.
*  This is Jake Levin from Jews for Racial and Economic Justice.
*  The U.S. government sends so much support to the Israeli military that it contracts
*  with private companies to send these—it doesn't have enough planes to send the amount
*  of bombs that they are trying to send and planes and tanks that they're trying to
*  send to Israel.
*  It's not right.
*  Disgusting!
*  Disgusting is what it is.
*  Atlas Air is the world's third-largest cargo company, has hundreds of millions of dollars
*  in federal contracts and received $18 million in New York state tax breaks and subsidies.
*  In Sudan, the U.N. has declared a famine in the Zamzam camp in the besieged North Tharfour
*  city of El-Fasher.
*  The camp houses half a million displaced people.
*  The U.N. warns at least 13 other Sudanese regions are also on the path to famine amidst
*  the protracted civil war, which has ravaged the country since April 2023.
*  In February this year, doctors at our borders warned one child was dying of starvation every
*  two hours at Zamzam.
*  Nearly 40 percent of infants and toddlers were malnourished.
*  In Nigeria, at least two people have been killed in northern Niger state as security
*  forces fired on demonstrators amidst a growing nationwide anti-government protest movement.
*  Protesters are calling for an end to corruption, the soaring cost of living in bad governance.
*  This is activist and journalist Abi-Odin Sanousi speaking from Lagos Thursday.
*  Things have been expensive in the market.
*  Nigerians are starving, Nigerians are hungry, Nigerians are angry.
*  As you know, in Nigeria today, a lot of people are unemployed.
*  The issue of insecurity in the north and the southeast continues to increase every day.
*  So we are here to just make our grievances known to the federal government.
*  The Biden administration has recognized Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez as the
*  winner of Sunday's contested presidential election.
*  A move expected to add to tensions with President Nicolas Maduro, who has called for a new revolution
*  if the U.S. and other foreign actors continue to challenge his reelection for a third term.
*  Venezuela's electoral body declared Maduro the winner Monday, but his rivals have claimed
*  they have proof that Edmundo Gonzalez received more votes but have not made this evidence
*  public.
*  Here in New York, the chief of the Honduran National Police has been sentenced to 19 years
*  in prison after pleading guilty earlier this year to cocaine trafficking charges.
*  Juan Carlos El Tigre Bonilla was extradited to the United States in 2022 and was expected
*  to go on trial with former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez when Bonilla accepted
*  a plea deal.
*  Bonilla was accused of deploying Honduran armed forces to protect drug traffickers and
*  enabled the flow of cocaine shipments in Honduras while committing widespread human rights abuses
*  while receiving the backing of the United States.
*  Former Honduran President and longtime U.S. ally Juan Orlando Hernandez was sentenced
*  to 45 years in a U.S. prison in June after a jury convicted him of cocaine trafficking.
*  In Texas, Eddie Canales, a tireless advocate for immigrant rights and founder of the South
*  Texas Human Rights Center, died this week at 76 after a battle with pancreatic cancer.
*  Canales was well known for setting up water stations around rural Brooks County for migrants
*  traveling through the brutal border landscape and for helping families who are searching
*  for loved ones who've disappeared or died during the treacherous journey.
*  Canales spoke about his work several times on Democracy Now!, including just last year.
*  Juan Canales, former U.S. ally and former U.S. ally,
*  was sentenced to 45 years in prison for drug trafficking charges.
*  Migrant deaths continue to happen until we have a policy that makes sense in terms of
*  receiving workers that are coming through, essential workers that are coming through
*  to provide and contribute to this economy and this country.
*  And also at the same time, you know, deal with the lack of human rights from their home country.
*  In Missouri, 52-year-old Christopher Dunn was freed this week after spending nearly
*  three and a half decades in prison on a now-overturned murder conviction.
*  Dunn, who is black, was convicted in 1991 when he was just 19 years old on eyewitness
*  testimony of two young teens who later recanted. Dunn's conviction was overturned last week,
*  but Missouri's attorney general blocked a judge's order for his
*  immediate release, delaying his freedom until Tuesday this week.
*  South Carolina's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday death by firing squad is a lawful method of
*  state-led execution, and it does not constitute cruel or unusual punishment, since death row
*  prisoners can also choose to be electrocuted or die by lethal injection instead. The ruling means
*  the state could soon resume executions, which have been on hold since 2011.
*  The ACLU of South Carolina said, quote,
*  Execution is a costly, ineffective form of cruel and unusual punishment that not only fails to make
*  us safer, but raises the possibility of the state killing innocent people in our name, unquote.
*  And the Navajo Nation has temporarily banned any transport of uranium and other radioactive
*  material over its land without an explicit approval. The executive order issued by the
*  Navajo Nation President Boone Neogren will be in effect for at least the next six months.
*  Earlier this week, Navajo police attempted to stop two trucks carrying uranium ore across
*  the reservation from an Arizona mine to a Utah processing mill. Neogren said Energy Fuels Inc.,
*  which owns the mine and processing mill, did not provide any notice that the trucks would be
*  crossing through Navajo Nation. Neogren said in a statement, quote,
*  We're taking the stance of interpreting and executing the law to ensure the safety of our
*  people and respect for Navajo sovereignty, unquote. And those are some of the headlines.
