*  for lower-income families. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OcfdUMIgVw&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump has canceled scientific gatherings and panels across federal health agencies [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OcfdUMIgVw&t=175.88s)]

*  policies and the Republican-backed Clinton-era welfare reform that ended up doubling extreme [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OcfdUMIgVw&t=236.96s)]
*  poverty and depriving those most in need of essential government support. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OcfdUMIgVw&t=242.88s)]
*  It led to caseload reductions, people getting off of welfare, going back into the workforce. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OcfdUMIgVw&t=248.2s)]
*  And we think that that type of thinking should be applied to other federal programs. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OcfdUMIgVw&t=253.83999999999997s)]

*  the dignity of work. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OcfdUMIgVw&t=269.88s)]
*  And you believe cutting off health care encourages people to work when they need to get better [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OcfdUMIgVw&t=270.88s)]
*  help in order to work? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OcfdUMIgVw&t=274.96s)]
*  Again, Senator— [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OcfdUMIgVw&t=277.52s)]
