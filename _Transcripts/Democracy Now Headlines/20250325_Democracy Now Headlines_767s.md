*  The group of at least 15 settlers also assaulted activists with the Center for Jewish Nonviolence. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=115.7s)]
*  The attack took place in the village of Sussia, in the Masafah Yata region. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=122.26s)]
*  One of Balal's co-directors, journalist Basel Adra, said the group entered their village [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  and started the assault shortly after residents broke their daily Ramadan fast. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  Balal screamed, I'm dying, as he was being brutally beaten. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=138.92s)]
*  He was then loaded while heavily bleeding into an Israeli military vehicle he has not [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=144.04s)]
*  been seen since. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=150.44s)]
*  We'll speak with his co-director, Basel Adra, and an eyewitness from the Center for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=152.32s)]
*  Jewish Nonviolence, after headlines. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=157.54s)]
*  In a stunning breach of security protocol, senior members of Trump's administration [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  unknowingly shared plans to bomb Yemen with a reporter on an unclassified Signal Group [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=168.34s)]
*  chat. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=175.73999999999998s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, revealed the chats in a piece headlined [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=176.73999999999998s)]
*  The Trump administration accidentally texted me its war plans. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=183.38s)]
*  Goldberg said he did not think the chat could be real until U.S. strikes actually did hit [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=189.1s)]
*  Yemen on March 15th. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=195.46s)]

*  Pete Hegseth and Vice President J.D. Vance. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=204.12s)]
*  Vance initially argued against the strikes, saying, quote, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=208.06s)]
*  "...3 percent of U.S. trade runs through the Suez, 40 percent of European trade does." [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=211.86s)]

*  flag and fire. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=234.22s)]

*  National security experts say using Signal to share classified information likely violates [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=241.73999999999998s)]
*  the Espionage Act and Federal Records Law. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=247.18s)]

*  Details have not been made public, but a main issue on the agenda was reportedly the revival [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=327.36s)]
*  of a 2022 grain deal allowing Kiev to export across the Black Sea in exchange for an easing [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=332.32s)]
*  of Western sanctions on Moscow. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal in the landmark legal case Giuliana [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=342.86s)]
*  v. the United States. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=348.38s)]
*  The lawsuit has inspired other successful cases by youth demanding the government take [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=350.46s)]
*  responsibility for the climate crisis. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=354.91999999999996s)]
*  This is Matos Santos of the group Our Children's Trust, which brought the case. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=357.79999999999995s)]
*  For nearly a decade, 21 young people fought to hold the U.S. government accountable for [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=362.35999999999996s)]

*  Today, the Supreme Court refused to hear their case. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=370.79999999999995s)]
*  And in a very rare move, the Department of Justice issued a statement calling the lawsuit [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=373.9s)]
*  a distraction. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=377.62s)]
*  That's coming from the shock and awe administration actively dismantling environmental laws, the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=379.3s)]
*  agencies that enforce them and our democracy. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=384.02s)]
*  Giuliana has spanned four presidents. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=387.22s)]

*  It's about fundamental rights, life, liberty and a livable future. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=390.42s)]
*  That's why young people are winning from Montana to Hawaii. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=394.18s)]
*  We're not done. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=397.66s)]
*  We'll see the federal government back in court. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=398.9s)]

*  which could have a major impact on the future of the already weakened Voting Rights Act. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=445.78000000000003s)]
*  The case centers on whether Louisiana's new congressional map, which created a second [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=451.14000000000004s)]
*  majority black district, is unconstitutional. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=456.66s)]
*  One-third of Louisiana's population is black. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=460.18s)]
*  Last year, using the newly drawn maps, voters elected Cleo Fields, a black Democrat, to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=463.68s)]
*  represent the district, sending two Democrats from Louisiana to the House for the first [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=468.68s)]
*  time in a decade. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=474.18s)]
*  President Trump threatened Monday to impose 25 percent tariffs on any country that imports [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=477.68s)]
*  oil or gas from Venezuela. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=483.96000000000004s)]
*  Trump claimed the move was in retaliation for Venezuela, quote, purposefully and deceitfully, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=486.92s)]
*  sending criminals and gang members to the U.S. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5gVyF0XI8o&t=493.24s)]
