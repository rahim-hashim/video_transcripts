This Sunday marks five years since George Floyd was murdered by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. In a video that shocked the world and spurred a global movement for racial justice, Chauvin pinned Floyd to the ground with a knee to his neck for eight minutes while Floyd gasped for air. Floyd repeatedly said, “I can’t breathe.”

Despite the nationwide uprising that followed Floyd’s killing, Congress failed to pass legislation that sought to reduce racial profiling and the use of force by law enforcement. The Trump Justice Department dismissed police reform and oversight agreements in Minneapolis and Louisville earlier this week, just days ahead of the fifth anniversary. We speak with Nekima Levy Armstrong, Minneapolis-based civil rights attorney, activist and founder of the Racial Justice Network, on where the movement for racial justice stands today.

*  George Floyd gasped for air. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=32.6s)]

*  I can't breathe. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=38.72s)]
*  The warning in the video is extremely graphic. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  Three other officers stood with Derek Chauvin, one of them holding back those who wanted [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=56.24s)]
*  to help George Floyd. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=70.48s)]
*  In the days that followed, thousands took to the streets of Minneapolis, and demonstrators [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=72.04s)]
*  set fire to a police precinct just hours after prosecutors said they were not yet sure if [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=75.56s)]
*  they would criminally charge Chauvin for murdering George Floyd, as seen in the video, even as [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=80.66s)]
*  police fired tear gas and rubber-coated bullets. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=85.48s)]
*  It demonstrated as the protests spread to become the largest nationwide uprising since [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=87.72s)]
*  the 60s as protesters shut down cities across the United States. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=91.4s)]
*  Despite the uprising that followed George Floyd's killing, Congress failed to pass [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=115.48s)]
*  the legislation named in Floyd's memory that sought to reduce racial profiling and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=121.92s)]
*  the use of force by law enforcement. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  This comes as the Justice Department this week dismissed police reform and oversight [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  agreements in Minneapolis and Louisville, just days ahead of the fifth anniversary of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=132.84s)]
*  the police murder of George Floyd. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=138.84s)]
*  The consent decrees came in response to Floyd's murder, as well as the Louisville police [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=140.44s)]
*  killing of Breonna Taylor March 13, 2020, after federal investigations found patterns [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=145.44000000000003s)]
*  of unconstitutional and racist police practicing in both cities. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=151.0s)]
*  The Trump administration disputed those findings and dismissed the consent decrees as federal [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  micromanagement. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=159.68s)]
*  For more, we're joined in Minneapolis by Nakeema Levi-Armstrong, civil rights attorney, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=160.68s)]
*  activist, founder of the Racial Justice Network, previously served as president of the Minneapolis [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  NAACP. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=170.12s)]
*  Nakeema, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=171.12s)]
*  We first spoke to you in 2020, two days after George Floyd's murder. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=173.64s)]
*  Can you talk about the significance of this moment and what we can learn from what happened [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  at the time? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=186.6s)]
*  First, the charges not being brought, then it being taken out of the hands of the local [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=187.6s)]
*  authorities and the state of Minnesota brought those charges? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=191.32s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Amy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=198.32s)]
*  We can learn from that moment that people in our community are not going to sit on the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=200.08s)]
*  sidelines when folks in elected positions take their time in bringing about justice. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=207.28s)]
*  As you know, there was an uprising that occurred in the city of Minneapolis as people applied [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  to elected officials to do their jobs and to ensure accountability, not only for Derek [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=224.32s)]
*  Chauvin, but the other three officers as well who were involved in the brutal killing of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  George Floyd. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=238.0s)]
*  Explain what the protests did. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=242.12s)]
*  We talked about the local authorities saying they weren't sure if they were going to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=244.56s)]
*  bring charges. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=248.32s)]
*  And then you had Keith Ellison, the attorney general of the state of Minnesota, who had [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=250.32s)]
*  formerly been a congressmember, and the governor. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=257.36s)]
*  Talk about how the responsibility then shifted and the charges were brought and what happened [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  to these four police officers. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=268.28s)]
*  Thank you for that question. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=272.4s)]
*  I will say that it's important for people to understand that even when there is a video [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=273.47999999999996s)]
*  of heinous police abuse, that does not guarantee that justice will occur, as we just saw with [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  Tyree Nichols and the way in which that particular case has panned out. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=287.84s)]
*  So in the city of Minneapolis, one of the first steps was ensuring that all four officers [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=294.28s)]
*  were fired for their misconduct. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=300.72s)]
*  And that was the result of Chief Madeira Arredondo, our city's first black chief of police, making [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=303.64s)]
*  that decision within hours after George Floyd's murder came to light and meeting with black [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=310.76s)]
*  community leaders to hear our perspectives before making that decision. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=318.52s)]
*  Once that happened, of course we had the first protest plan where thousands of people showed [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=324.44s)]
*  up at the site where George Floyd was killed. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=330.8s)]
*  We marched to the third precinct police station where the officers had typically worked who [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=333.6s)]
*  were responsible for killing George Floyd. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=340.36s)]
*  And then from that point, we started a rallying cry for those officers to be charged and arrested [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=343.04s)]
*  for what they did. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=350.8s)]
*  Now the governmental officials were slow to respond initially, and after some public pressure, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=352.64s)]
*  the county attorney at the time, Mike Freeman, decided to only charge Derek Chauvin. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=359.8s)]
*  The charges were legally insufficient, they were below the standard, as well as the criminal [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=365.84s)]
*  complaint against Derek Chauvin. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  So when I saw that, I reached out to movement lawyers through the National Lawyers Guild. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=375.28s)]
*  I expressed my concerns about the process, they agreed with me. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  So we called a mass demonstration along with other activist organizations like Black Lives Matter. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=385.88s)]
*  And we had thousands of people in front of the governor's mansion explaining to people [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=393.32s)]
*  how the charging decision by the county attorney was inadequate. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=399.52s)]
*  And Governor Walz actually came out of his mansion, he listened to us, break down what [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  the concerns were, how things needed to change. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=410.6s)]
*  And after that, I received a call from his staff to meet with him directly. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=416.48s)]
*  So he and I had a Zoom call. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=421.96s)]
*  During that call, I laid out more of the legal issues, as well as the fact that he needed [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  to use his executive authority to remove the case from the hands of the county attorney [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=430.0s)]
*  and to put the case into the hands of the attorney general. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=436.0s)]
*  And Amy, you and the rest of the world saw the results of that trial during the prosecution [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=440.68s)]
*  of Derek Chauvin, which was a masterclass on how to effectively and successfully prosecute [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=448.84000000000003s)]
*  a cop who used deadly force unjustifiably. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=456.32s)]
*  Once the case was in the hands of the attorney general's office, the other thing that happened [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=461.04s)]
*  is that not only was Derek Chauvin charged, but all four of the officers were charged [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=465.72s)]
*  as well, and the charges for Derek Chauvin were also upgraded. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=470.92s)]
*  And as you know, ultimately, all four of those officers were convicted in state and federal [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=475.36s)]
*  court as a result of the murder of George Floyd. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=481.36s)]
*  In 30 seconds, can you tell us about Trump lifting the consent decrees off of the Minneapolis [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=486.04s)]
*  Police Department, Louisville, Breonna Taylor, the significance of this? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=492.72s)]
*  It is very clear that Donald Trump's intention is to roll back the progress that began, I [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=501.32000000000005s)]
*  would say, in 2020 and even before that, when the folks in Ferguson, Missouri rose up after [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=508.88000000000005s)]
*  Mike Brown was killed. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=514.52s)]
*  It is a slap in the face to the black community and communities around the country for Trump's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=516.24s)]
*  DOJ to withdraw from the consent decree process. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=521.88s)]
*  It's unconscionable. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=526.08s)]
*  It's unacceptable. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=527.6s)]
*  And I would argue that it is an attempt to create a race war, wanting us to take to the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=529.0s)]
*  streets so that Donald Trump can use martial law against protesters. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=533.78s)]
*  But we're not falling for the bait. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=538.4399999999999s)]
*  We are continuing to call out these injustices and to say that we are expecting accountability. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=540.32s)]
*  reform and transformation of police departments that engage in unconstitutional policing [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=548.36s)]
*  practices. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=555.92s)]
*  Nikki, we just have another 30 seconds. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=556.92s)]
*  And my question to you is, the police murder of George Floyd happened during the first [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=560.84s)]
*  term of President Trump. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=565.36s)]
*  To say the least, he's been openly hostile to the Black Lives movement. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=567.8000000000001s)]
*  In 2020, he reportedly ordered the military to, quote, beat the F out of BLM protesters, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=573.04s)]
*  even shoot them. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=578.64s)]
*  Where does the movement go from here, as you mark it in Minneapolis this weekend? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=580.28s)]
*  I think that the movement has to continue to grow stronger. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=586.92s)]
*  We have to resist the pressure that is coming from the White House to be silent and to feel [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=591.68s)]
*  as if the concerns that we're bringing don't hold merit. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=600.88s)]
*  We know that is not the truth. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=604.76s)]
*  We know that racial injustice in America is still alive and well. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=606.76s)]
*  We know that police brutality continues to occur at alarming rates. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=611.16s)]
*  And we have to continue to use our voices and stand up against Donald Trump and stand [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=616.76s)]
*  up against these systems of oppression, regardless of the pressure that he is attempting to apply [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=622.68s)]
*  in this hour. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=629.1999999999999s)]
*  This moment calls for us to rise up and continue to take a stand for freedom, justice and equality [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=630.48s)]
*  in this country, and especially for those who are most vulnerable to police violence [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBWPWCS-1Q&t=638.2s)]
