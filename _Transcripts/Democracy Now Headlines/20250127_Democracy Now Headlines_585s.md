The Senate has confirmed former Fox News host Pete Hegseth as Trump's defense secretary by just one vote. Hegseth has "very clear" ties to extreme Christian nationalism, as well as a history of alleged sexual assault and abuse. Logan Davis, a reporter in Denver, Colorado, who grew up in the same classical Christian educational movement that Hegseth is raising his family in, explains the problematic ideology that shapes it. Hegseth has endorsed leaders in the community and their beliefs that the church possesses supremacy over worldly affairs, antebellum slavery was a "beneficent American institution" and the U.S.'s global war on terror is a modern-day iteration of the medieval Crusades. Davis says Hegseth's lack of qualifications for his new role means he will likely be "leaning on these controversial faith leaders in his life more than someone with adequate experience" would be — bringing this extremist Christian nationalism into the mainstream.

*  Pete Hegseth and I Know the Same Christian Nationalists. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=66.08s)]
*  Logan, welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=71.12s)]
*  Claim his record and what you mean by extreme Christian nationalism. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=74.92s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=80.72s)]
*  Important thing to understand about Pete Hegseth is that he's been very clear about what he [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=84.48s)]
*  believes and what faith communities he sees himself as being a part of. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=88.22s)]
*  He's written books. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  He has appeared on podcasts. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  In Hegseth's case, he is affiliated with a conservative sect of Calvinists who have [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=95.4s)]
*  been driving the classical Christian education movement for a long time, which he is also [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=100.96s)]
*  associated with, embrace things like sphere sovereignty and have been at really— [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  Sphere sovereignty? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=110.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=111.36s)]
*  So sphere sovereignty is the extreme interpretation of Christian nationalism referenced in The [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=112.36s)]
*  Guardian this most recent week in which there is an understanding of different authorities [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=117.88s)]
*  being given to the church, the state, the family, etc. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=124.36s)]
*  And ultimately, the church is above all of those. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=128.4s)]
*  So Hegseth is a member of a faith community that believes in the supremacy of the church [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=131.78s)]
*  over earthly affairs and has pursued that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  And I think there's reason for concern as to which of those beliefs he will bring to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=139.56s)]
*  the Pentagon. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  So, if you can talk about, for example, his views of women, whether he's talking about [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  out of combat military, what that means, how that fits into his Christian nationalist beliefs. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=154.4s)]
*  So Christian nationalism, of course, has some variety towards it, to it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=162.76s)]
*  In Hegseth's case, he's a member of a community that very much is led by a man named Doug [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=167.44s)]
*  Wilson based out of Moscow, Idaho. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=172.76s)]
*  Wilson has been a lightning rod for controversy over the last few decades for his positions [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=175.24s)]
*  on things like slavery and the separation of church and state and, in this case, whether [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=180.0s)]
*  or not women should have the right to vote. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=185.76s)]
*  He has said that that was bad for the family. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=187.76s)]
*  In this community, there is a certain chauvinism. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=191.28s)]
*  And I think it is interesting that Hegseth is stepping into this role shortly after we've [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=195.16s)]
*  had conversations about women in combat roles, about greater egalitarianism in the military. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=200.38s)]
*  I would expect that he's going to see some of that rolled back, and I think that his [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=205.8s)]
*  spiritual leaders and folks like Doug Wilson would be pleased to see that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=209.52s)]
*  So talk more about the glorification of the Confederacy as a godly cause within reformed [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  Calvinist circles and their views of slavery, particularly what Pete Hegseth has said. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=222.28s)]
*  So we know that Hegseth has strongly endorsed Wilson's take on this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=232.2s)]
*  Doug Wilson has made the Confederacy a pretty popular trope in reformed and classical Christian [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=236.32s)]
*  education circles, which has always been interesting to me, given that he is not even a Southerner. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=244.92s)]
*  Going back several decades, Wilson has really embraced a neo-Confederate strain. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=250.28s)]
*  Two decades ago, he wrote a pamphlet entitled Southern Slavery as it Was with a guy named [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=256.4s)]
*  Steve Wilkins, who was the head of the League of the South, which is listed by the Southern [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=262.47999999999996s)]
*  Poverty Law Center as a hate group. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=266.67999999999995s)]
*  Wilson and Wilkins toured with this pamphlet, which essentially argued that antebellum slavery [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=269.23999999999995s)]
*  in the American South was a beneficent institution that kept families together and helped expose [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  black families to the gospel. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  So he really argued full-throated that the institution of American slavery was a beneficent [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=283.32s)]
*  American institution. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=289.54s)]
*  And we know that Hegseth has studied at this man's feet. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=291.14s)]
*  He talks on virtually every podcast he has been on about the most recent thing he has [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=294.86s)]
*  read from Doug Wilson. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=299.3s)]
*  He seems to have consumed all of his books. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=300.48s)]
*  He talks about him on podcasts constantly. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  Most people in American public life do not have a track record of having defended antebellum [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=306.56s)]
*  American slavery. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=311.18s)]
*  The fact that the incoming secretary of defense firmly sides with a man on the other side [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=312.24s)]
*  of that divide is probably not a great sign. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=317.0s)]
*  I wanted to talk about your background and Pete Hegseth's background, the community [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=320.76s)]
*  of the Reform Calvinists, the Hegseth family, and what you were a part of. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  For example, you grew up in a Reform Calvinist church that was similar to Hegseth's, one [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=333.36s)]
*  of his children attending the high school that Hegseth's child attends. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  So I did. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=351.32000000000005s)]
*  I grew up in the Reformed community in and around Nashville, Tennessee. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=352.32000000000005s)]
*  My father is actually a pastor. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=355.66s)]
*  To his credit and ours, when the Doug Wilson faction, the communion of Reformed evangelical [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  churches splintered off, we did not go with it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  However, a lot of the folks in our school, which was a classical Christian school, very [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=366.04s)]
*  much affiliated with our church, did. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=369.9s)]
*  And that's kind of a whole package, the church and classical school thing. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=372.26s)]
*  So I do know many of the same people as Hegseth. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=377.26s)]
*  The classical school that he moved to Nashville to send his children to is kind of a bookend [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=381.29999999999995s)]
*  to the one that I grew up in. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=386.21999999999997s)]
*  They are on either end of the Nashville area. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=387.34s)]
*  Several alumni from my school have taught his children. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=390.85999999999996s)]
*  I'm very familiar with the doctrine and the curriculum that they share, because I was [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=394.62s)]
*  taught much of it as a child, less so on the doctrine side towards as things got a little [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=400.18s)]
*  bit later. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=405.02s)]
*  We were never, for instance, on the slavery defending end of things. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=406.02s)]
*  The curriculum, however, at the classical Christian schools, nearly identical. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=409.18s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of reason for concern in there as well, because there are, for instance, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=413.65999999999997s)]
*  those tropes about the Confederacy or the Crusades and how those things are portrayed. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=418.18s)]
*  I think that it's a risky thing to be teaching young children. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=421.66s)]
*  And talk about the tattoos on his body, not just artwork, but the political and religious [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=425.54s)]
*  significance that go back to the Crusades, Logan. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=432.7s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=437.26s)]
*  The Crusades are a popular historical trope in this community. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=438.26s)]
*  During the first couple decades of this century especially, we saw the Crusades kind of resurge [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=443.34000000000003s)]
*  in popularity in curriculum and discussion for the obvious reason that it was being used [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=449.18s)]
*  to impose a kind of clash of civilizations frame on the global war on terror conflicts [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=455.86s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=461.06s)]
*  And it was being done in such a way as to cast Christian America as the sword of the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=462.06s)]
*  Lord in that context. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=466.78000000000003s)]
*  With Hegcess' service and what we know he has said about that, it is pretty clear that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=469.38s)]
*  his Crusader tattoos are a reference to his service in the war on terror. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=473.82000000000005s)]
*  So, in this last minute, we have, if you can respond to him becoming head of this 3 million [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=479.54s)]
*  person organization, the charges against him of spousal abuse, of rape, but they were nondisclosure [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=486.34s)]
*  agreements, nondisparagement agreements, repeatedly of public drunkenness and driving to veterans [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=498.53999999999996s)]
*  organizations, well, of financial irregularity in running these two organizations. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=506.94s)]
*  This is the thing about Hegcess, right, is we can talk about his faith, we can talk about [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=515.54s)]
*  his community. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=520.42s)]
*  The biggest problems with Hegcess, I mean, his beliefs are troubling, but he is wildly [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=522.3s)]
*  unqualified for this role. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=526.34s)]
*  He also has a long track record of demonstrating a fairly serious moral unfitness to be in [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=528.7800000000001s)]
*  polite society. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=536.5s)]
*  My biggest concern with that is a man holding these fairly intense, far outside of mainstream [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=538.22s)]
*  beliefs, finding himself in a position well beyond anything he is qualified for or has [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=543.98s)]
*  experience in, I think that that puts us in a position where he is likely going to be [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=548.94s)]
*  controversial faith leaders in his life more than somebody with adequate experience for [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=554.74s)]
*  the job might. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=559.74s)]
*  So, I think we do need to be concerned about— [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=560.74s)]
*  Logan, we're going to have to leave it there. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=563.22s)]
*  Thank you so much, but we'll link to your article in the Colorado Times-REPORTER, Logan [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=565.54s)]
*  Davis. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=569.58s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=570.58s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=571.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rpwLU8cipE&t=583.74s)]
