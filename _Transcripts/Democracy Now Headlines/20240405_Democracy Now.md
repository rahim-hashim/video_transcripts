# Top U.S. & World Headlines — April 5, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [April 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_lBc6yLDlU)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel says it'll open Gaza aid routes, including the northern Erez border crossing, after President
*  Biden called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and a phone call with Prime Minister
*  Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday.
*  Biden also reportedly told Netanyahu future U.S. policy will be determined based on Israel's
*  to address the spiraling humanitarian disaster.
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the remarks as he spoke from the NATO headquarters
*  in Brussels.
*  And with regard to our policy in Gaza, look, just say this.
*  If we don't see the changes that we need to see, there'll be changes in our own policy.
*  It's the most direct public warnings issued by the U.S. against Israel.
*  But we're not accompanied by any concrete action to prevent Israel from carrying out
*  more killings.
*  The confirmed death toll in Gaza has topped 33,000, over 14,000 of those children.
*  Thousands of others are unaccounted for.
*  The Washington Post reports the Biden administration Monday approved the transfer of thousands
*  more bombs to Israel the same day Israeli airstrikes in Gaza killed seven aid workers
*  with the World Central Kitchen, including a U.S. citizen.
*  Earlier today, Israel released its report on the killing, saying the attack was a serious
*  violation of military procedures and blamed it on mistaken identification of the vehicles.
*  The World Central Kitchen had coordinated with Israeli military officials and received
*  clearance to travel on the route where it was attacked, and it's clearly marked WCK
*  vehicles.
*  It's demanding an independent investigation.
*  Another video has emerged appearing to show Israeli forces shooting an unarmed Palestinian
*  as he attempted to collect aid.
*  The footage aired on Al Jazeera shows people retrieving air-dropped aid packages in northern
*  Gaza.
*  One man is then singled out and shot as he was walking with an aid package.
*  His lifeless body is then left to a pair of dogs.
*  The Human Rights Monitor, Euromed, released a report this week that found Israel killed
*  563 Palestinians and injured over 1,500 as the Israeli military targeted distribution
*  centers, workers and civilians waiting for aid.
*  The Palestine Red Crescent Society called for immediate action to halt the bloodshed.
*  The Palestinian members of our teams were killed since the beginning of the war.
*  Those dedicated heroes who lost their lives in service to others.
*  We mourn the loss of our colleagues, our friends and our loved ones.
*  We cannot wait any longer.
*  Civilians, humanitarians and medical personnel must be protected and respected.
*  The international community must take action now to end the suffering in Gaza.
*  Israeli airstrikes continue in Rafah, killing at least two children yesterday.
*  Following the attack, survivors search the rubble for signs of life.
*  If the world believes that what is happening in the Gaza Strip is because of what happened
*  on October 7th, then this is a delusion, a great delusion.
*  What happened indicates that there are significant plans that were put in place for the Gaza
*  Strip, and the proof is that it is not possible that plans for displacement and starvation
*  can occur overnight.
*  America is providing some aid to us, and given to Israel military aid, they provide humanitarian
*  aid to us and then provide military aid to them.
*  It is like they are saying, kill them, but nicely.
*  A new Human Rights Watch report finds an October 31st Israeli airstrike on a six-story apartment
*  building in central Gaza is an apparent war crime.
*  Human Rights Watch released this video accompanying their findings.
*  Without warning, four munitions struck the building in the space of 10 seconds.
*  The airstrike demolished the building and killed at least 106 people, including 54 children.
*  Human Rights Watch's research found no apparent military target in or near the building.
*  The airstrike violated the laws of war and is an apparent war crime.
*  Human Rights Watch also urged Israel's allies, including the U.S. and European nations, to
*  suspend arms transfers to Israel and back the International Criminal Court's investigation
*  into likely war crimes.
*  This comes as earlier today the U.N. Human Rights Council adopted a resolution calling
*  for Israel to be held accountable for possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in
*  Gaza.
*  A doctor at an Israeli field hospital for detained Palestinians said in a letter to
*  government officials, quote, we are all complicit in breaking the law, unquote, as they described
*  the horrific conditions for Palestinian patients.
*  The doctor said patients at the Negev Desert facility regularly have their legs amputated
*  because of handcuff injuries and that prisoners are fed through straws forced to defecate
*  and held in constant restraints.
*  In occupied East Jerusalem, Israeli police fired tear gas to disperse worshippers after
*  dawned prayers at the Al Aqsa Mosque compound earlier today, the last Friday of Ramadan.
*  Israeli authorities have been restricting access to the holy site for Palestinians throughout
*  Ramadan.
*  Today also marks Al Quds Day, an annual event to express solidarity with Palestinians in
*  opposition to the Israeli occupation.
*  Several protests and other actions are taking place around the world, including in Pakistan,
*  Yemen, Jordan and the occupied West Bank.
*  The Israeli military's halted all leave for its combat soldiers and drafted reservists
*  amidst a possible escalation with Iran.
*  Tehran has vowed to retaliate after Israel bombed the Iranian consulate in Damascus Syria
*  Monday killing at least seven Iranian officers, including three generals.
*  Israel is also blocking GPS across parts of Syria to disrupt missiles and drones.
*  On Thursday, Netanyahu further escalated threats against Iran.
*  We will know how to defend ourselves and we will act according to the simple principle
*  that whoever hurts us or plans to hurt us, we will hurt them.
*  On Wednesday, the U.S., along with the U.K. and France, opposed a Russian-drafted U.N.
*  Security Council statement condemning the attack in Syria.
*  Meanwhile, the leader of the Houthi movement said 37 people have been killed in U.S. and
*  U.K. strikes on Yemen since the start of the war.
*  The two countries have launched over 400 attacks on Yemen, despite President Biden admitting
*  they would not resolve the issue of Houthi forces targeting ships in the Red Sea to disrupt
*  Israeli-linked trade.
*  In California, activists blocked all entrances to Lockheed Martin's research campus in
*  Sunnyvale, laying down in the rain to prevent workers from entering.
*  Lockheed Martin is the largest arms manufacturer and supplies Israel with F-35s, F-16s, Hellfire
*  missiles and other weapons Israel uses against Palestinians.
*  At one point, a Lockheed Martin employee was filmed driving his car through a line of activists
*  nearly running them over before lashing out and yelling, somebody's going to die while
*  waving a knife.
*  This is Christina Liu, an activist from the group Bay Area Palestine Solidarity.
*  We must stop arming Israel.
*  There is no business as usual while Gaza is destroyed.
*  Lockheed Martin enables another massacre every day in pursuit of endless U.S. military expansion.
*  Here in New York, the Columbia University chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine
*  say,
*  Columbia suspended six students with no due process, giving them just 24 hours to leave
*  university housing before evicting them.
*  The suspensions are part of an investigation into a Palestine solidarity event and come
*  as part of a wider crackdown on student activism for Palestinian rights.
*  Peru's Congress voted against advancing the impeachment process for President Dina
*  Baluarte as she faces a corruption probe dubbed Rolexgate.
*  Baluarte has been accused of illegally acquiring more than a dozen luxury watches and jewelry
*  over the past three years.
*  The deeply unpopular president came to power following the December 2022 ousting of Pedro
*  Castillo from office.
*  Since then, she's backtracked on a pledge to hold early presidential elections and oversaw
*  a deadly crackdown on protests following Castillo's ouster.
*  Dozens of people were killed by security forces and what Amnesty International says may constitute
*  extrajudicial killings.
*  Back in the United States, judges, jurors and more than 70 current and former prison
*  workers are calling for a halt to the scheduled execution next Tuesday of Missouri death row
*  prisoner Brian Dorsey.
*  One former prison officer who knew Dorsey wrote in the Kansas City Star, quote,
*  From my perspective, after decades and corrections, I do not hesitate to say that executing Brian
*  Dorsey would be a pointless cruelty, said.
*  Dorsey was convicted of killing his cousin and her husband in 2006.
*  His request for clemency is based on inadequate representation from court-appointed lawyers
*  and the fact that he's turned his life around in prison while working as a barber.
*  Missouri Governor Mike Parson could commute Dorsey's sentence to life without parole.
*  Meanwhile, Oklahoma executed Michael DeWayne Smith Thursday in the first of 25 executions
*  planned this year.
*  This week, Oklahoma Judge Gary Lumpkin told state execution schedulers to, quote,
*  suck it up and man up after they requested more time between executions in order to reduce
*  trauma on staff and the potential for errors.
*  In New York, hundreds of housing justice advocates rallied outside the headquarters of the Real
*  Estate Board of New York to demand it stops blocking the passage of good cause eviction
*  legislation.
*  Good cause eviction would protect tenants from huge rent hikes and retaliatory or discriminatory
*  evictions.
*  As protesters peacefully blocked the entrance of the Real Estate Board's building, police
*  started arresting activists.
*  New York City public advocate Jumaane Williams spoke before he, too, was arrested.
*  The people of the city of New York, the people of this state, deserve not to be evicted frivolously.
*  They deserve to be able to go and say, can you please repair my home without being evicted?
*  They deserve rent so they can afford.
*  The rent is too damn high.
*  It's been too damn high for many years.
*  And Bishop Thomas Gumbleton, longtime leader in the U.S. Catholic Peace and Justice Movement,
*  has died at the age of 94 in Detroit.
*  He helped found Pax Christi and bred for the world and was a war tax resistor.
*  He was also a survivor of sexual abuse in the church, who was forced to resign in 2007
*  after he spoke out publicly in favor of an Ohio bill to extend the statute of limitations
*  for cases of sexual abuse by clergy.
*  In 2013, Bishop Gumbleton spoke to Democracy Now! about his work with the Survivors Network
*  of those abused by priests known as SNAP.
*  What really opened my eyes was when a friend of mine, in fact the person who started SNAP,
*  came to me and asked me to intervene with the local bishop because the priest who had
*  abused her and who had also abused other people that she was aware of was still functioning.
*  And I said, that's impossible.
*  You were the bishop of Detroit and he was in Toledo.
*  Well, I was an auxiliary bishop in Detroit, but I was a friend of Barbara Blaine, the
*  founder of SNAP for decades.
*  And when she came to me and told me this, I said, well, I'll go see the bishop and
*  I'll talk to him.
*  And I'm sure he's not going to continue to keep this covered up.
*  Well, I went to see him and he assured me, I'll do something about it.
*  I'll take care of it.
*  So I took him at his word, but nothing ever happened.
*  And so that made me realize that some of the, well, best bishops around were not dealing
*  with this issue the way it needed to be dealt with.
*  I mean, it just was terribly wrong to allow a priest to continue to function in a situation
*  where he could abuse other children.
*  And it turned out he was still abusing other people.
*  And so—
*  The priest was?
*  Yes.
*  And the bishop was allowing this to go on.
*  That was Bishop Thomas Gumbelton, who passed away Thursday at the age of 94.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
