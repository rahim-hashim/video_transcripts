As President Trump continues to sign new executive orders attacking transgender people and their rights, we hear voices of protest from New York, where hundreds of people rallied Monday outside NYU Langone Hospital in Manhattan to demand it continue providing gender-affirming care for trans patients, after news that some patients had been dropped by the hospital. This comes after the Trump administration signed an order withholding federal research and education grants from hospitals that offer gender-affirming care to transgender people under 19.

*  Others, such as the New York City Hospital Network, NYU Langone, tried to quietly cancel [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=36.32s)]
*  appointments. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=42.24s)]

*  This comes as the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and others filed a lawsuit [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=61.099999999999994s)]
*  Tuesday on behalf of transgender youth who say the order is depriving them of medical [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=65.12s)]
*  care, quote, solely on the basis of their sex and transgender status, unquote. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=69.02s)]

*  Hill was willing to go to jail to continue to provide transgender health care. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=78.96s)]

*  officials, medical professionals, NYU workers and trans activists at a rally to demand the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=89.32s)]
*  NYU Langone Hospital Network ensure gender-affirming care for trans patients. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=95.11999999999999s)]

*  And it's amazing to be surrounded by people who are fighting for my rights. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=105.44s)]
*  Even if it's a... [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=109.44s)]
*  I have been stripped of my rights again with NYU Langone denying access to life-saving [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=116.44s)]

*  I came here straight from school and when I walked into first period, which was algebra, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=126.44s)]
*  everyone asked why I had a megaphone with me, which I'm not even using because I'm using [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=130.44s)]
*  a mic now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=134.44s)]

*  My friend hadn't heard the news yet and she started freaking out, telling me that she [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=144.44s)]
*  had an appointment there, scheduled for a month from now, and asking me if that would [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=147.44s)]
*  still happen. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=152.44s)]
*  I told them that I don't know. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=153.44s)]
*  But we're here today demanding that it will. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=154.44s)]
*  I'm Cynthia Nixon. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=161.44s)]
*  And I'm here as a lifelong New Yorker. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=165.44s)]

*  And I am here as actually a resident of Kips Bay. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=174.44s)]
*  I live just a few blocks over there. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=177.44s)]
*  And NYU is my hospital. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=180.44s)]

*  My trans kid had his top surgery at NYU a number of years ago. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=228.44s)]
*  His doctors were fantastic. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=236.44s)]
*  His surgeon was the best we could have imagined. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=241.44s)]
*  And the idea that the city is filled with young people who thought they had a place [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=245.44s)]
*  to go where they could receive the highest care, and that place has now been shut to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=254.44s)]

*  to say that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=279.44s)]
*  But in the same breath, I can say that I am scared for myself, for my own health care, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=280.44s)]
*  and for all of the other people like me. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=286.44s)]

*  own rights or the rights of the people that we love and care about, don't let them win. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=301.44s)]
*  Some of the voices at the rally Monday calling on the NYU Langone Hospital Network to continue [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA4sVyPn98&t=308.44s)]
