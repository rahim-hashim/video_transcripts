Thousands of informational government webpages have been taken down so far in the second Trump administration, including on public health, scientific research and LGBTQ rights. Amid this mass erasure of public information, the Internet Archive is racing to save copies of those deleted resources. The San Francisco-based nonprofit operates the Wayback Machine, a popular tool that saves snapshots of websites that may otherwise be lost forever, and it has archived federal government websites at each presidential transition since 2004. While it's normal for a new administration to overhaul some of its online resources, the Trump administration's pace of destruction has shocked many archivists. "There have been thousands and thousands of pages removed," says Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine, who notes that even a page about the U.S. Constitution was scrubbed from the White House website.

*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=9.96s)]
*  We end today's show with Mark Graham, director of The Way Back Machine at The Internet Archive, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=10.96s)]
*  to look at efforts to preserve thousands of government web pages being deleted by the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=19.6s)]
*  In this first part of our interview that we do, Mark, if you can tell us what exactly [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=21.32s)]
*  is happening. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=25.94s)]
*  MARK GRAHAM, DIRECTOR OF THE WAY BACK MACHINE, THE WAY BACK MACHINE, THE WAY BACK MACHINE, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=26.94s)]
*  THE WAY BACK MACHINE, THE WAY BACK MACHINE, THE WAY BACK MACHINE, THE WAY BACK MACHINE, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=27.94s)]
*  THE WAY BACK MACHINE, THE WAY BACK MACHINE, THE WAY BACK MACHINE, THE WAY BACK MACHINE, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=28.94s)]
*  I want to give you a little bit of context. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=29.98s)]
*  The Internet Archive is a nonprofit digital library with a mission of universal access [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=31.740000000000002s)]
*  to all knowledge. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=38.06s)]
*  About 28 years ago, the founder of the Internet Archive, Brewster Kahle, pressed record on [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=40.3s)]
*  a new media called the Web. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=47.18000000000001s)]
*  And we've been working very hard every day since getting better at doing just that, archiving [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=50.3s)]
*  much of the public Web. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=57.22s)]
*  We archive more than the Web. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=60.0s)]
*  We archive books and television news and microfiche and microfilm and academic papers, and I could [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=61.68s)]
*  go on and on. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  But the bread and butter of the operation here and through the Way Back Machine is archiving [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=70.04s)]
*  the public Web. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=77.12s)]
*  What I think we want to focus on today is efforts around archiving and making available [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=79.64s)]
*  material from the U.S. government. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=85.76s)]
*  So in 2004 and every four years since, we have, in collaboration with others, focused [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=90.0s)]
*  on archiving much of what is published by the U.S. government before and after each [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=99.72s)]
*  presidential election. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=107.42s)]
*  This is referred to as the end of term archive. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=110.14s)]
*  You can read more about this by going to EOTarchive.org. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=114.84s)]
*  So every four years, we do a deep dive on tens of thousands of government websites and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=121.16s)]
*  millions and millions of pages. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=128.94s)]
*  So this last time around, we endeavored to do this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=131.68s)]
*  We compiled a list of web pages and websites in collaboration with the Library of Congress, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=137.32s)]
*  the National Archives and Records Administration, and the U.S. Government Publishing Office. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=144.32s)]
*  So we have this—we had this big list. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=149.84s)]
*  And before the election, we went through and we worked to archive as much of that material [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=152.82s)]
*  as we could. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=159.32s)]
*  That was phase one. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=160.84s)]
*  We did a second phase after the election, and we're now involved in a third phase [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=162.48s)]
*  of this work, which we started post-inauguration. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=168.4s)]
*  So, can you tell us about what you understand the Trump administration is doing right now, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=171.48s)]
*  removing thousands of pages related to— [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=178.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=180.6s)]
*  —what? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=181.6s)]
*  Diversity and so—and gender ideology, as they say, as well as targeted scientific research [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=182.6s)]
*  and environmental justice data? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=190.92s)]
*  There have been thousands and thousands of pages removed. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=193.32s)]
*  Many websites, for example, the USAID site, if you go to it right now, it just basically [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  tells you how you can get your materials if you had been an employee there. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=203.92s)]
*  A site called reproductiverights.gov. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=210.6s)]
*  I could go on. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  Many, many sites are just gone. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  And then, like I said, at least 8,000—we'd actually know the number at this time—web [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=217.76s)]
*  pages have been removed. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=225.76s)]
*  And these are web pages that deal with topics like education and health issues, climate [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  change, aviation, weather. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=233.16s)]
*  There was even a web page on the White House website about the U.S. Constitution that's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=235.96s)]
*  not there anymore. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=242.44s)]
*  And so, the good news is that we've gotten pretty good at this effort. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=244.28s)]
*  We, as I said, have done a very thorough job of archiving this material. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=249.56s)]
*  I should also say that we do this work in collaboration with many other organizations. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  This end-of-term archive is a team effort. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=260.52s)]
*  We work with Harvard's Library Innovation Lab, the University of North Texas, Stanford [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=264.24s)]
*  Libraries, the Common Craw Foundation, and EDGE, Environmental and Data Governance Initiative. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=270.0s)]
*  And I want to highlight the work of EDGE, because what they have historically done is, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=277.52s)]
*  after the fact, after a change of presidential administration, they've gone in and tried [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=282.92s)]
*  to analyze what, in fact, had changed when the new administration came in. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=288.2s)]
*  So, they're deep in doing that work now. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=293.12s)]
*  We also, as you can see— [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  We have 20 seconds for this segment, Mark. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=301.36s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=302.36s)]
*  So, you know, I'd say the Wayback Machine is available to anyone. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=303.36s)]
*  It's a free public service at web.archive.org. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=309.0s)]
*  Will it stay up? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=311.6s)]
*  Will it stay up? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=313.32000000000005s)]
*  It's stayed up for 28 years, and we're pretty sure it's going to stay up for at [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  least 28 more, absolutely. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=318.76000000000005s)]
*  So, Mark, we want you to stay with us. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=319.76000000000005s)]

*  Mark Graham is the director of the Wayback Machine at the Internet Archive, also part [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U38hSOZgQAk&t=324.0s)]
