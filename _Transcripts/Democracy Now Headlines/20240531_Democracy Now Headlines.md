*  After three weeks of testimony and less than 12 hours of deliberation, a Manhattan jury
*  has found former President Donald Trump guilty on all 34 felony charges of attempting to
*  2016 presidential election by falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment.
*  Sentencing has been scheduled for July 11th, just four days ahead of the Republican National
*  Convention in Milwaukee.
*  Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is the first former U.S. president
*  to be convicted of a felony.

*  This was a rigged, disgraceful trial.
*  The real verdict is going to be November 5th by the people.

*  we write this letter as a small gesture of our love and solidarity, unquote.
*  President Biden has given Ukraine permission to defensively deploy U.S. weapons to strike
*  targets inside Russia close to Ukraine's northeast Kharkiv region.

*  opened in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Guatemala could be resettled in Greece or
*  Italy.
