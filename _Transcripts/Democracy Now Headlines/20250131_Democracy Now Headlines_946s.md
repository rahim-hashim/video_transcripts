Donald Trump is blaming DEI for the deadliest U.S. aviation disaster in more than two decades, when a regional jet and a U.S. Army helicopter collided over a Washington, D.C. airport, killing 67 people. "We have a long list of problems that need to be addressed. â€¦ Instead, we're talking about a nonsensical issue that is not based in fact," says FAA-licensed aircraft dispatcher Bill McGee, who says criticisms of DEI distract from and work against a critical staffing shortage at the FAA. McGee also discusses the dangerous politicization of the FAA and the increasing influence of Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, over the aviation industry.

# "Nonsensical": As Trump Blames Crash on DEI, Aviation Expert Says It's Understaffing, Lax Regulation

*  Trump proceeded to blame, without evidence, Democrats and federal workplace DEI initiatives [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=25.0s)]
*  for the deadliest U.S. aviation disaster in more than two decades. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  My administration will set the highest possible bar for aviation safety. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=35.72s)]
*  We have to have our smartest people. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=40.68000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't matter what they look like, how they speak, who they are. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  It matters intellect, talent, the word talent. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=46.92s)]
*  You have to be talented, naturally talented geniuses. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=50.68s)]
*  You can't have regular people doing that job. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=55.28s)]
*  They won't be able to do it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=57.28s)]
*  But we'll restore faith in American air travel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=59.6s)]
*  I'll have more to say about that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=62.0s)]
*  I do want to point out that various articles that appeared prior to my entering office, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=63.96s)]
*  and here's one. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  The FAA's diversity push includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=74.08s)]
*  psychiatric disabilities. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=80.28s)]
*  That is amazing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  And then it says FAA says people with severe disabilities are most underrepresented segment [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=85.52s)]
*  of the workforce, and they want them in and they want them. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=91.88s)]
*  They can be air traffic controllers. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=95.28s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=97.16s)]
*  This was on January 14th, so that was a week before I entered office. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=98.68s)]
*  They put a big push to put diversity into the FAA's program. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  Trump was reading from a year-old online report about efforts at the FAA to hire people with [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=111.2s)]
*  disabilities. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  During the news conference, journalists repeatedly questioned Trump about his unfounded assertions. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  This is one exchange with New York Times reporter David Sanger. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=120.76s)]
*  Mr. President, you have today blamed the diversity elements, but then told us that you weren't [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=125.16s)]
*  sure that the controllers made any mistake. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  You then said perhaps the helicopter pilots were the ones who made the mistake. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=135.32s)]
*  It's all under investigation. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=141.0s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=142.0s)]
*  That's why I'm trying to figure out how you can come to the conclusion right now that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=143.0s)]
*  diversity had something to do with this crash. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=147.44s)]
*  Because I have common sense. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=150.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=152.12s)]
*  During Thursday's news conference, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth echoed Donald Trump's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=153.44s)]
*  attacks on diversity. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=161.0s)]
*  We will have the best and brightest in every position possible. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  As you said in your inaugural, it is colorblind and merit-based. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=168.28s)]
*  The best leaders possible, whether it's flying Blackhawks and flying airplanes, leading [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=173.16s)]
*  platoons or in government. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=177.9s)]
*  The era of DEI is gone at the Defense Department, and we need the best and brightest, whether [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=180.36s)]
*  it's in our air traffic control or whether it's in our generals or whether it's throughout [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=186.56s)]
*  government. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=191.52s)]
*  During Thursday's press conference, Vice President J.D. Vance echoed Trump's attacks [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=193.16000000000003s)]
*  on DEI. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=197.28000000000003s)]
*  When you don't have the best standards in who you're hiring, it means, on the one [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=199.72000000000003s)]
*  hand, you're not getting the best people in government, but on the other hand, it puts [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=204.28000000000003s)]
*  stresses on the people who are already there. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=208.08s)]
*  And I think that is a core part of what President Trump is going to bring and has already brought [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  to Washington, D.C., is we want to hire the best people because we want the best people [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  at air traffic control, and we want to make sure we have enough people at air traffic [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=220.0s)]
*  control who are actually competent to do the job. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=223.44s)]
*  If you go back to just some of the headlines over the past 10 years, you have many hundreds [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=226.44s)]
*  of people suing the government because they would like to be air traffic controllers, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=230.68s)]
*  but they were turned away because of the color of their skin. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  That policy ends under Donald Trump's leadership because safety is the first priority of our [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=237.08s)]
*  aviation industry. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=241.68s)]
*  For more, we're joined by Bill McGee, senior fellow for aviation and travel at American [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=242.68s)]
*  Economic Liberties Project. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=247.96s)]
*  As an FAA-licensed aircraft dispatcher, he spent seven years in airline flight operations [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=250.44s)]
*  management and is the author of Attention All Passengers, The Airline's Dangerous [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=257.12s)]
*  Descent and How to Reclaim Our Skies. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  He teaches at Vaughn College of Aeronautics. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=266.0s)]
*  Bill McGee's new piece for Fromers is headlined The Big Lie of Aviation DEI. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=268.92s)]
*  Now, I want to point out, Bill, that you wrote this piece not in response to the news conference [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=274.56s)]
*  at the White House, but before the White House news conference and before the crash. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=280.88s)]
*  Can you talk about what's going on here? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=288.08s)]
*  when asked about any other issue, said, well, the investigation has to continue. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=292.0s)]
*  But he still blamed the crash on DEI. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=298.8s)]
*  Yes, you're right. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=302.8s)]
*  The fact is that these rumors, which are unfounded, have been swirling around aviation for more [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=306.2s)]
*  than 20 years, but they are not based in fact. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=311.84s)]
*  That's why I wrote what I wrote in Fromers the other day. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=314.84s)]
*  That was again, as you pointed out, you know, the day before the crash. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=318.72s)]
*  But it's not as if what we heard this week, we haven't heard before. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=322.56s)]
*  And it's simply unfounded. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=326.76000000000005s)]
*  As you just pointed out, these rumors are not at all based in fact, what the DEI initiatives [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  at the FAA and at other agencies as well, but specifically at the FAA, what they were [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=335.68s)]
*  meant to do was to broaden the pool of recruitment for positions. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=341.16s)]
*  But this needs to be said in all caps and bold. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=347.52s)]
*  The fact is there has not been a loosening of standards. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=350.35999999999996s)]
*  The same standards have to apply in terms of testing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=354.88s)]
*  You know, when I was licensed as an FAA dispatcher, we had a written test, we had an oral test, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=358.64s)]
*  we had an eight hour practical exam. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=363.2s)]
*  All of those things are still in place. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=366.0s)]
*  No one is going into safety critical jobs without being prepared. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=367.96s)]
*  Bill McGee, Trump blamed Biden. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=373.12s)]
*  He blamed Obama. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=376.74s)]
*  He blamed Pete Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=378.5s)]
*  He said they actually came out with a directive to white, and we want the people that are [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  competent, he said. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=390.42s)]
*  They kept talking about the best and the brightest, not to be confused with the best and the whitest. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=391.94s)]
*  If you can comment on this and the history of this, where his certainty comes from, he [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=396.54s)]
*  says it's just common sense, yet presented absolutely no evidence. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=404.14s)]
*  Well, I think we need to step back a moment and look at the bigger picture with what is [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=409.94s)]
*  really going on here. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=415.65999999999997s)]
*  We have an aviation industry in crisis, and we've had that for several years now at [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=417.32s)]
*  the FAA, at Boeing, at the airlines. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=422.53999999999996s)]
*  And for every minute that we spend talking about DEI, we're not talking about so many [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=425.97999999999996s)]
*  other critical issues. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=430.24s)]
*  The FAA safety inspectors, they have been understaffed for 40 years. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=432.78s)]
*  It's not just a matter of throwing money at these problems, but the FAA needs to be realigned. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=436.42s)]
*  Since the Reagan administration, it has not kept pace with the industry. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=441.3s)]
*  And we can go through a long list of problems that are not being addressed by this. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=445.46s)]
*  And every time I hear this, DEI, that's why I wrote the column I wrote, the DEI issue, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=449.7s)]
*  in my view, it's a distraction. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=455.14s)]
*  For those that are serious about aviation safety, they know we have a long laundry list [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=456.94s)]
*  of problems that need to be addressed with air traffic control, with maintenance outsourcing, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=460.78000000000003s)]
*  with the oversight of the airlines, the oversight of Boeing. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=465.5s)]
*  And instead, we're talking about a nonsensical issue that is not based in fact. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=468.74s)]
*  After Donald Trump's inauguration, the White House issued an executive order titled Keeping [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=477.54s)]
*  Americans Safe in Aviation that rescinds all diversity, equity and inclusion hiring programs [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=482.26s)]
*  at the FAA. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=489.22s)]
*  I want to turn to Rick Larson, ranking member of the House Committee on Transportation Infrastructure, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=491.62s)]
*  criticizing the executive order in a statement, saying, quote, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=496.38s)]
*  "'Hiring air traffic controllers is the number one safety issue according to the entire aviation [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=499.34000000000003s)]
*  industry. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=504.06s)]
*  Instead of working to improve aviation safety and lower costs for hardworking American families, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=505.22s)]
*  the administration is choosing to spread bogus DEI claims to justify this decision.'" [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=509.98s)]
*  When you have, Bill, the New York Times reporting and others, that it looks like the Black Hawk [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=517.1s)]
*  helicopter with the threeâ€”and usually it's supposed to be four people, soldiers, insideâ€”being [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=526.18s)]
*  off the actual route and too high. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=532.98s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=537.66s)]
*  And I think, you know, Representative Larson is correct as well. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=541.1s)]
*  We have had an air traffic controller shortage in this country for several years now. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=544.7s)]
*  These issues cross political lines, by the way. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=549.5s)]
*  They go back years and years. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=551.5400000000001s)]
*  And the pipeline actually improved under Secretary Buttigieg and President Biden. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=553.46s)]
*  We started seeing more air traffic controllers come online. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=559.1s)]
*  But we do not have enough. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=562.5400000000001s)]
*  And when you look at what happened the other night in the Potomac River, I know that airport [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=564.1s)]
*  very, very well, DCA, because when I was working in airline flight operations, I worked for [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=569.0600000000001s)]
*  the Northeast shuttle. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=573.34s)]
*  So I dealt with DCA dispatching flights there every day of the week. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=574.62s)]
*  And I can tell you, it's one of the most challenging airports in the country. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=578.98s)]
*  And we need the absolute full staffing of air traffic control at DCA and at airports [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=582.18s)]
*  all across the country. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=588.68s)]
*  We're not there. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=590.14s)]
*  The irony here is that for all the knock on DEI, it's about doing that. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=591.42s)]
*  It's about broadening the net of trying to attract more people into aviation, people [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=596.46s)]
*  that traditionally were not drawn to aviation. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=605.3000000000001s)]
*  You mentioned I teach at Vaughan College of Aeronautics. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=608.7800000000001s)]
*  It happens to be the most diverse student body of any college in the country. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=611.0s)]
*  And I see it all the time. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=616.38s)]
*  We're sending more and more people into aviation who wouldn't before. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=618.0400000000001s)]
*  We need to get rid of the rumors that are unfounded about the safety question. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=622.46s)]
*  And we need to start doing things to improve the system, including staffing, staffing at [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=628.1800000000001s)]
*  the FAA on the air traffic control side and staffing at the FAA on the safety inspector [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=633.66s)]
*  side. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=638.74s)]
*  We all know that Boeing is a mess. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=639.8000000000001s)]
*  This was once probably the greatest corporation in this country. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=641.28s)]
*  And why is it a mess? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=645.24s)]
*  Well, in large measure, it's because the FAA hasn't been able to inspect it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=646.24s)]
*  They have something called a designee system that allows Boeing employees to be the eyes [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=649.9399999999999s)]
*  and ears of the FAA. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=654.66s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=656.3199999999999s)]
*  Imagine having to tell your boss that you need to shut down the assembly line. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=657.3199999999999s)]
*  You're a mid-level manager, and your mortgage is riding on this. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=660.54s)]
*  It's a system that really needs to be revamped from top to bottom. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=664.42s)]
*  So the crash comes as the Federal Aviation Administration is lacking an administrator, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=669.3399999999999s)]
*  though Trump just named one. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=673.9399999999999s)]
*  But it was lacking an FAA administrator after Elon Musk pressured Mike Whitaker to announce [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=675.98s)]
*  his early resignation in December. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=683.1400000000001s)]
*  Musk was furious with Whitaker after the FAA fined Musk's SpaceX over $600,000 for safety [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=686.22s)]
*  violations on Florida's Gulf Coast. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=694.58s)]
*  Musk has also accused the FAA of slowing development of its experimental Starship rocket. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=697.6600000000001s)]
*  Earlier this month, the FAA grounded Starship after a test vehicle caught fire, veered [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=703.38s)]
*  off course and exploded high above the Caribbean. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=708.58s)]
*  The disaster-triggering massive sonic booms as fiery debris re-entered the atmosphere [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=711.62s)]
*  at hypersonic speeds, littering the Turks and Caicos with rocket parts and forcing airlines [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=717.58s)]
*  to divert dozens of flights. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=723.3s)]
*  So the richest man in the world forces the head of the FAA out, and now, just after the [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=726.1s)]
*  crash, Trump names a new FAA administrator, Christopher Rosciolo, a 22-year veteran of [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=731.98s)]
*  the agency. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=739.98s)]
*  Can you respond to Musk and what you know about the new FAA head? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=740.98s)]
*  Yeah, you raise a great question, you know, because about 15 years ago, the FAA Reauthorization [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=744.82s)]
*  Act in Congress specifically changed the parameters so that the FAA administrator term would be [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=751.34s)]
*  five years. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=756.86s)]
*  And the clear intent there was that aviation safety is so critical that it should rise [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=758.34s)]
*  above politics and that a five-year term would guarantee that an administrator would be in [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=764.02s)]
*  office during any kind of a presidential transition, from one party to another, from one president [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=769.62s)]
*  to another. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=775.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, we didn't see that happen, right? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=776.6600000000001s)]
*  Michael Whitaker was in office only for a little more than a year. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=779.5s)]
*  He should have been in office for five years, and he was removed on Inauguration Day. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=782.5s)]
*  As you say, all of the media reports indicate this was because of Musk and because of Whitaker [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=787.5799999999999s)]
*  coming down on his company. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=793.14s)]
*  This is not how the system is supposed to work. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=795.2199999999999s)]
*  Aviation safety should be above politics. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=798.26s)]
*  And unfortunately, for decades now, we have seen not administrators, but acting administrators. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=801.14s)]
*  That's what we have seen in the first Trump administration. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=807.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, you'll recall the two fatal Boeing 737 MAX accidents. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=811.38s)]
*  It wasn't until after the second accident in early 2019 that it was as if the administration [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=816.28s)]
*  woke up and said, oh, we don't have an FAA administrator. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=821.64s)]
*  Now, I know there are those that are going to say an acting administrator is almost as [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=824.1999999999999s)]
*  good as an administrator. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=828.12s)]
*  It's not the case. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=829.4s)]
*  Yes, they can run the day to day and they can deal with crises and they can put out [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=830.4s)]
*  whatever fires are burning that day, but they do not have the ability to look at long-term [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=834.72s)]
*  issues, including staffing. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=841.12s)]
*  And so, we have to start treating this more seriously. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=843.2s)]
*  A permanent FAA administrator needs to be in place at all times. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=846.0s)]
*  So you have right nowâ€”yeah, he may be the richest man in the world, not to be glib, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=851.1600000000001s)]
*  but the guy who keeps blowing up rockets is now influencing airline safety policy. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=856.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very dangerous situation. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=862.08s)]
*  There's no two ways about it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=864.6800000000001s)]
*  The FAA used to be called the goal standard for a government agency overseeing aviation. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=867.68s)]
*  Other nations, when they had problems, when they had accidents that weren't even in any [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=876.0s)]
*  way related to the United States, not involving a U.S. built aircraft, not involving a U.S. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=879.12s)]
*  airline, they would turn to the FAA and the NTSB and ask for assistance. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=885.3199999999999s)]
*  We are no longer the goal standard. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=889.7399999999999s)]
*  It's just that simple. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=891.0s)]
*  We have seen it in recent years when other countries have said, no, we'll do without [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=892.2s)]
*  the FAA on this investigation, particularly after the Boeing Max crashes. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=898.24s)]
*  This is not how to run the FAA, to have someone like Elon Musk come in and make these decisions. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=902.32s)]
*  Bill McGee, I want to thank you for being with us, Senior Fellow for Aviation and Travel [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7ADVDCUwQ&t=908.72s)]
