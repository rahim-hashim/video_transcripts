# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” December 2, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [December 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaZQY1pZ9Qo)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, War, Peace and the Presidency.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  President Biden's issued a pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, Sunday evening, in a major
*  reversal after President Biden repeatedly vowed not to use his executive authority to
*  intervene in his son's criminal cases.
*  Hunter Biden was set to be sentenced December 12th for his federal gun conviction and on
*  December 16th for his California tax evasion case.
*  President Biden said he made the decision because the charges against Hunter were politically
*  motivated, he said, and instigated by his rivals, saying his son was, quote,
*  "'singled out only because he is my son,' unquote.
*  President Biden's now facing renewed pressure to commute the sentences of death row prisoners
*  and to pardon or grant clemency to political prisoners like indigenous leader Leonard Peltier
*  and the whistleblowers, Edward Snowden and Julian Assange.
*  Meanwhile, the group The Debt Collective posted, quote,
*  "'Pardon our student loans next.'"
*  Health officials in northern Gaza report Israeli attacks killed more than 200 people on Saturday.
*  The dead included 40 members of the Alaraj family, who were killed in a single Israeli
*  strike on a building in the Tel Azatar neighborhood.
*  Israel has also killed a number of medical professionals and aid workers in recent days.
*  On Friday, a drone killed Dr. Ahmed Al-Khalout, head of the Intensive Care Unit at Kamel Adwan
*  Hospital in Beit Lachia.
*  A separate Israeli drone strike killed Chef Mahmoud Ahmadhoon, who co-founded the Gaza
*  Soup Kitchen that has fed Palestinians suffering from hunger due to Israel's blockade of
*  food aid.
*  Ahmadhoon was killed on his way to Kamel Adwan Hospital.
*  On Saturday, Israel bombed a vehicle in Chanyunis, killing five people, including three aid workers,
*  with World Central Kitchen.
*  Israel also killed a staff member of Save the Children Saturday in an airstrike on Chanyunis.
*  Meanwhile, Maisarah Ahmed Saleh has become the 192nd journalist killed by Israel.
*  He worked for the Quds News Network.
*  Attacks also continued on Gaza City, where residents of the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood
*  gathered to clear the rubble and recover the bodies of loved ones killed in an Israeli
*  overnight strike Saturday.
*  I want to tell the free people of the world that claim freedom and call on human freedom
*  and peace.
*  We ask what has kept you silent for a year and a month.
*  We'll speak with the director of philanthropy,
*  Dr. Shafiq Al-Masri.
*  Dr. Shafiq, thank you for your time.
*  I'm very grateful to you for your time.
*  I'm very grateful to you for your time.
*  I'm very grateful to you for your time.
*  I'm very grateful to you for your time.
*  I'm very grateful to you for your time.
*  We'll speak with the director of philanthropy of UNRWA USA later in the broadcast, who lost
*  his brother this weekend.
*  The Biden administration has reportedly approved another $680 million weapon sale to Israel,
*  including thousands of additional Joint Direct Attack Munition Kits and hundreds of small-diameter
*  bombs.
*  The deal is separate from the $20 billion arms sales recently approved by the U.S. Senate.
*  This comes as Israel's former defense minister, Moshe Boggi Yalon, has accused Israel of ethnic
*  cleansing and committing war crimes in Gaza.
*  Yalon, who served as Netanyahu's defense minister from 2013 to 2016, made the accusation
*  several times over the weekend, including in an interview on one of Israel's biggest
*  television channels.
*  To occupy, to annex, to cleanse ethnic cleansing, look at the northern Gaza Strip and settle
*  a Jewish settlement.
*  That's the point.
*  There is no Beit Lehiyeh.
*  There is no Beit Hanon.
*  They are operating in Jabalia and are essentially clearing the area of Arabs.
*  Israel is continuing to strike Lebanon despite last week's ceasefire.
*  France has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire at least 52 times.
*  Meanwhile, residents of southern Lebanon continue to return home to assess damage caused by
*  Israel's invasion, defying threats by Israeli forces not to travel south.
*  This is Hamza Al-Ulta, who ran a soup kitchen out of his home in the city of Baalbek, which
*  was destroyed in the Israeli invasion.
*  This kitchen, where we used to cook in the month of Ramadan, we used to cook for special
*  occasions to be able to feed orphans, residents and those in need that nobody is looking out
*  for.
*  Two thousand five hundred people daily in Ramadan, thirty days, two thousand five hundred
*  people, used to eat the food from this kitchen.
*  Are there rockets in this kitchen?
*  They did not even show mercy to those in need.
*  Even those in need, they did not spare.
*  Where is the mercy?
*  In Syria, opposition forces are pushing towards Hama after launching a surprise offensive
*  to seize most of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city.
*  Syrian and Russian forces have launched air attacks on the rebel-held cities of Idlib
*  and Aleppo, a city where rebels were driven out eight years ago by Bashar al-Assad's
*  forces.
*  The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports 446 people have been killed
*  in Syria since Wednesday.
*  The offensive is being led by an armed group called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which grew out
*  of the Nusra Front, which had ties to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.
*  We'll have more on Syria later in the broadcast.
*  Here in New York, police arrested 21 activists who disrupted the annual Macy's Thanksgiving
*  Day parade Thursday.
*  The protesters briefly blocked off part of the parade route, unfurling a banner that
*  read, quote, "'Don't celebrate genocide.
*  Arms embargo now.
*  Free Palestine,' unquote.
*  The following day, protests unfolded in malls and other retail sites across the United States
*  as shoppers headed to stores for Black Friday sales.
*  Palestinian rights groups had called on consumers to boycott Black Friday in protest.
*  Senate-elect Donald Trump has announced plans to nominate Cash Patel to replace current
*  FBI Director Christopher Wray, who Patel has called a, quote, "'stooge of the deep state.'"
*  Patel is a Trump loyalist who has called for the FBI's D.C. office to be closed and turned
*  into a, quote, "'museum of the deep state.'"
*  Last year, during an interview with Steve Bannon, Cash Patel called for prosecuting
*  journalists.
*  We will go out and find the conspirators not just in government but in the media.
*  Yes, we're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens,
*  who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.
*  We're going to come after you.
*  Whether it's criminal or civilly, we'll figure that out.
*  But yeah, we're putting you all on notice.
*  Cash Patel has also embraced QAnon conspiracy theories.
*  Supported the January 6th insurrection, has made hundreds of thousands of dollars from
*  various commercial and consulting ventures tied to Trump.
*  The man who he would replace, Christopher Wray, was also appointed by Trump.
*  In other transition news, Trump has picked the real estate developer Charles Kushner
*  to be U.S. ambassador to France.
*  Kushner is the father of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who's married to Trump's
*  daughter Ivanka.
*  In 2020, Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, who spent 14 months in federal prison after pleading
*  guilty to tax evasion and witness tampering in the 2000s.
*  Trump has also picked the Lebanese-born billionaire Masad Boulos to serve as a new adviser in
*  Arab and Middle Eastern affairs.
*  Boulos is the father-in-law of Trump's other daughter, Tiffany.
*  The New Yorker magazine's Jane Mayers revealed Trump's pick for defense secretary Pete
*  Hegseth was forced out of leadership roles at two veterans' organizations for misusing
*  funds, sexually harassing women and being repeatedly drunk on the job.
*  According to a whistleblower report, Hegseth once had to be restrained from joining dancers
*  on the stage of a strip club.
*  In another incident, Hegseth drunkenly chanted,
*  "'Kill all Muslims!
*  Kill all Muslims!' at a bar," in 2015.
*  Meanwhile, The New York Times reports Hegseth's own mother once accused him of mistreating
*  women.
*  In 2018, Penelope Hegseth wrote him an email that read in part, quote,
*  "'On behalf of all the women, and I know it's many, you have abused in some way,
*  I say, get some help and take an honest look at yourself,'' unquote.
*  The email was sent a year after a woman accused Hegseth of raping her at a California hotel.
*  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago Friday, days
*  after Trump vowed to impose a 25 percent tariff on all Mexican and Canadian goods as soon
*  as he returns to office.
*  Canada since said it would implement more hard-line border measures in hopes Trump will
*  back down, including the possible deployment of drones and helicopters to the U.S.-Canada
*  border.
*  Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who threatened to slap retaliatory tariffs
*  on the U.S., also spoke with Trump last week after their phone call Trump declared Sheinbaum,
*  quote, "'agreed to stop migration through Mexico, effectively closing our southern border,''
*  unquote.
*  But President Sheinbaum refuted Trump's account, saying she simply explained Mexico's
*  continuing migration policies and that there's no plan to close borders, she said.
*  In the U.S., President Biden's in Angola today to promote a rail project that the U.S.
*  hopes will counter Beijing's influence in the region.
*  The project would connect the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia to Angola's port
*  of Lobito, allowing the U.S. to exploit the region's vast mineral resources, including
*  copper and cobalt.
*  The ongoing plundering of resources from the DRC by the U.S. and Europe has led to decades
*  of devastating war, poverty and environmental destruction.
*  It will be the first time a U.S. president visits Angola.
*  Chad has ended its longstanding military partnership with France.
*  The move is the latest blow to France's colonial legacy in the Sahel region and follows
*  the expulsion of French troops from Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.
*  Residents in Chad's capital, Jemena, voice their support.
*  I think the Chadian government is right to demand the departure of French troops, because
*  Chad has already had 66 years of independence, and the French troops are only here to plunder
*  Chadian resources.
*  They have nothing positive to offer.
*  Since their presence, we have faced attacks around the lake, but we have received no positive
*  response.
*  So the government is right.
*  We need to start developing now and be truly independent.
*  The announcement by Chad was made Thursday, hours after a visit by the French foreign
*  minister.
*  France currently has around 1,000 troops stationed in Chad, which won its independence from France
*  in 1960.
*  In the Republic of Georgia, over 200 people have been arrested in the capital, Tbilisi,
*  as tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets for a fourth straight day Sunday
*  to denounce the Georgian government's decision to suspend its bid to join the European Union.
*  The Georgian president, Salome Zoribishvili, who backs joining the EU, said she'll refuse
*  to leave office until new parliamentary elections are held following allegations of fraud against
*  the governing Georgian Dream Party, which claimed victory last month.
*  Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kovachidze praised police violence against protesters
*  and has said his government will not resume debate on joining the EU until 2028.
*  In India, civil liberties groups have criticized the Modi government for filing charges against
*  human rights activist Nadeem Khan as part of what's been described as a, quote, targeted
*  witch hunt.
*  Khan is a vocal critic of Hindu supremacist violence and runs a civil rights group that
*  tracks and fights cases of mob lynchings and hate crimes against Muslims.
*  The end to Global UN Summit on Plastics ended in Busan, South Korea, early this morning,
*  without a much-anticipated treaty after fossil fuel companies and oil-rich countries refused
*  to agree to limit plastic production.
*  The Panama delegation, which introduced a global proposal to cut down production, called
*  the conclusion of the summit a moral failure.
*  This is Juan Carlos Monterey Gomez from Panama's Ministry of the Environment.
*  Plastics are not convenience.
*  Plastics are poison.
*  Every piece that we allow to produce without limits is a direct assault on our health,
*  on our nature and our children.
*  For those blocking progress, you are allowing this crisis to fester, and it will kill us.
*  This is just not a treaty about plastics.
*  This is humanity's lie on the sand.
*  Over 100 countries back proposals to curb the world's output of plastic, but nations
*  including the U.S., Russia, Saudi Arabia and trade groups like the American Chemistry Council
*  have refused to support such a call, insisting on focusing on plastic pollution.
*  The world produces some 350 million metric tons of plastic waste each year.
*  About half of that ends up in landfills.
*  Less than 10 percent of it gets recycled.
*  The U.S. is the world's top contributor to plastic waste.
*  The UN talks will now head to yet another round next year.
*  On Saturday, Greenpeace activists staged a protest by boarding a tanker that was set
*  to load toxic plastic chemicals from South Korea's Hanwha Total Energies Complex.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
