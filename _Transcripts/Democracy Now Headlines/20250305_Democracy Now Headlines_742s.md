*  conglomerate. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eiuPAUzips&t=90.0s)]
*  The Panama Canal Authority is run entirely by the Panamanian government, not China, as [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eiuPAUzips&t=91.0s)]

*  This is about the people who are being punished by virtue of losing their healthcare. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eiuPAUzips&t=154.52s)]
*  This is the richest country in the world, and we have people who don't have good healthcare. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eiuPAUzips&t=159.64000000000001s)]
