# Top U.S. & World Headlines — December 17, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OWggsQEW5c)

*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In Gaza, Israeli troops, backed by armed drones, have attacked the Al-Mawasi refugee camp,
*  which Israel had designated as a so-called humanitarian safe zone.
*  Elsewhere, Israeli strikes have killed at least 10 people in Gaza City, while in northern
*  Gaza, Israel's once again targeted the Kamel Edwan Hospital, knocking out the hospital's
*  power generators, deploying explosive robots and planting booby traps around the hospital
*  grounds.
*  The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adnan Ghebreyesus, condemned Israel's
*  assault, writing, quote,
*  "'Recent attacks have further damaged the oxygen supply generators and broken windows
*  and doors of the patient's rooms.
*  The conditions in the hospital are simply appalling.
*  We urge for the protection of healthcare and for this hell to stop.
*  Ceasefire,' the head of HUSED."
*  Here in the United States, the family of Aysenur Ezgi Aygi, the 26-year-old Turkish-American
*  activist who was shot dead by Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank in September, is
*  criticizing Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
*  After talks at the State Department Monday, family members have been demanding the U.S.
*  launch an independent investigation into Aygi's killing, but said they left the meeting disappointed
*  and with doubts that they will ever receive justice.
*  Aygi, a recent graduate of the University of Washington, was shot and killed by Israeli
*  soldiers after taking part in a weekly protest against illegal Israeli settlements in the
*  town of Beit Ha.
*  Witnesses say she was fatally shot in the head by an Israeli sniper after the demonstration
*  had already dispersed.
*  On Monday evening, Michigan Congressmember Rashida Tlaib rallied with her family and
*  supporters in a protest outside the White House.
*  We all know that Aysenur's murder was not a tragic error, as the president shamelessly
*  called it.
*  It was devastating, I think, for her family to hear them say that.
*  And we know that, and she knew, that what the Israeli military did to her, they do the
*  Palestinians every single day.
*  Israel says it's closing its embassy in Ireland over Dublin's recognition of Palestinian
*  statehood and its backing of the South Africa genocide case against Israel at the World
*  Court.
*  On Monday, the Irish prime minister, Simon Harris, responded to the news.
*  We're all here today asking about Ireland's position.
*  What about Israel's actions?
*  What about what Netanyahu is doing to the innocent children of Gaza?
*  This is the diplomacy of destruction.
*  And I think it is deeply regrettable that they took that decision.
*  They have every right to take that decision to close the embassy.
*  I'd rather it didn't happen.
*  We will continue to engage, continue to engage diplomatically.
*  But nobody's going to silence Ireland.
*  Turkey's building up its forces along the Turkish border with Syria and possible preparation
*  for a large-scale incursion into territory held by U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds.
*  That's according to The Wall Street Journal, which reports a Kurdish invasion could be
*  imminent near Kobani, a Kurdish-majority city in Syria.
*  Meanwhile, Syria's ousted authoritarian president has made his first statement since
*  he fled to Russia to seek political asylum.
*  In a post on the Syrian presidency's Telegram channel, it looks like Bashar al-Assad is
*  writing that his departure from Syria was not planned and argued that Syria has, quote,
*  fallen into the hands of terrorism, unquote.
*  This comes as human rights groups are warning mass graves across Syria could contain the
*  bodies of more than 100,000 victims of Bashar al-Assad and his father Hafez.
*  One such site is in the Tadamoun district of Damascus, where researchers are scrambling
*  to examine evidence of widespread extrajudicial killings, including mass executions.
*  Hiba Zayeddin is Syria researcher at Human Rights Watch.
*  We found human remains, bones, you know, part of a skull, fingers, ribs strewn around the
*  entire area surrounding the mass grave, which shows that really, you know, a lot more happened
*  here than what we already knew.
*  What happened in Tadamoun here is just one of many others that are being, you know, found
*  out across the country.
*  And so it is really urgent that at this time, where we can see that there's quite a bit
*  of chaos given this transition, that there needs to be quick, urgent securing of all
*  of these areas so that we can really find out the truth about these places.
*  Ukraine says it's killed Russia's general of nuclear defense in a bomb attack on a Moscow
*  street.
*  Kyiv says General Igor Kirolov was targeted over the use of banned chemical weapons in
*  Russia's war on Ukraine.
*  Separately, Ukraine's special operations forces said it inflicted heavy damage on North
*  Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russia, killing some 50 fighters in recent days in
*  the Ukrainian-occupied Kyrgyz region.
*  In Madison, Wisconsin, a 15-year-old girl armed with a handgun opened fire inside a
*  private Christian school Monday, killing a teacher and another teenager before fatally
*  turning the gun on herself.
*  Six others were wounded in Monday's assault.
*  Police and paramedics were alerted by a second-grade student who dialed 911 to report the mass
*  shooting.
*  This is Maré Jen Charles, mother of three student survivors.
*  We always send prayers.
*  We always send talks.
*  And then when are we going to stop doing that?
*  This is not OK.
*  If your kids are at school, they are not OK.
*  If they are at church, they are not OK.
*  If they are outside, elsewhere, they are not OK.
*  Where are they going to be sent?
*  As many as 1,360 children have never been reunited with their parents six years after
*  the previous Trump administration forcibly separated them at the U.S.-Mexico border.
*  That's according to a new report by Human Rights Watch, which also warns against the
*  return to power of some of the key architects and enforcers of Trump's zero-tolerance
*  immigration policy, which caused long-lasting harm and trauma to asylum-seeking families.
*  The officials include Tom Holman, who has been nominated by Trump to serve as a so-called
*  border czar.
*  Human Rights Watch has urged the Senate to reject the appointment of any officials involved
*  in the family separation policy, which the group says, quote,
*  "...constituted enforced disappearance and may have constituted torture," they said.
*  Here in New York, the judge overseeing Donald Trump's hush money and election interference
*  criminal trial has refused to throw out Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts.
*  Judge Juan Marchand rejected arguments by Trump's lawyers that Trump should not have
*  been prosecuted because of the Supreme Court's July ruling that shields presidents from prosecution
*  for official acts.
*  Instead, Judge Marchand noted, Trump hadn't even been elected yet in 2016 and was therefore
*  acting in an unofficial capacity when he falsified business records to cover up hush money payments
*  made to adult film star Stormy Daniels.
*  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing growing calls to step down after his
*  finance minister quit amidst a public spat over how to respond to Trump's vow to impose
*  a 25 percent tariff on Canadian goods.
*  Chrystia Freeland, who was also Canada's deputy prime minister, has been replaced by
*  longtime Trudeau ally Public Safety Minister Dominique LeBlanc, who recently joined Trudeau
*  to dine with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, a meeting that notably did not include Freeland, the
*  former head of the Financial Times.
*  Embattled German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a no-confidence vote Monday, triggering an
*  early election in February of next year.
*  Frederick Mears, head of the center-right Christian Democratic Union, is widely favored
*  to win Germany's leadership as polls also show the far right could gain a record number
*  of votes.
*  In Brazil, authorities have arrested a military general and close ally of former president
*  Jair Bolsonaro as part of the criminal investigation into attempted coup to overturn the results
*  of the 2022 presidential election.
*  Walter Bragunetto was Bolsonaro's running mate in his failed re-election bid, which
*  Bolsonaro lost to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and served as defense minister.
*  Bolsonaro and Neto are among 37 officials who were indicted in November over the coup
*  plot.
*  Neto's arrest Saturday came after Brazilian authorities accused him of obstructing the
*  collection of evidence in their investigation.
*  Back in the United States, workers at three Amazon facilities have authorized a strike
*  setting up a potential work stoppage at the height of the holiday season at warehouses
*  in New York, Chicago and Atlanta.
*  The Teamsters Union says Amazon failed to come to the bargaining table by a deadline
*  of December 15th.
*  Amazon workers at a Staten Island warehouse here in New York became the first ever to
*  win a union election in the U.S. back in March of 2022.
*  This comes as a new investigation led by Senator Bernie Sanders finds Amazon systematically
*  ignores and rejects recommended worker safety measures and deliberately misrepresents workplace
*  injury data.
*  And a federal judge in Florida Monday sentenced members of a pan-Africanist group known as
*  the Uhuru Three to three years probation, meaning they will avoid prison time in a legal
*  saga that saw the anti-war activists targeted for their vocal criticism of U.S. policy.
*  The members of the African People's Socialist Party were convicted in September of conspiring
*  with the Russian government to sow discord and interfere in U.S. elections, which the
*  accused have rejected as ridiculous.
*  This is one of the Uhuru Three.
*  Amali Yeshitella speaking after the sentencing yesterday.
*  I want to say that the only reason this discussion is happening right now about free speech and
*  the judge was given an opportunity to make the ruling and make the statements that he
*  made the only reason he was given this opportunity is because we fought.
*  If we had laid down we wouldn't have had this discussion.
*  To see our interviews with Amali Yeshitella and our coverage of this case go to democracynow.org.
