President Donald Trump has returned to Washington after a NATO summit where leaders agreed to increase their military spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, more than doubling the current target of 2%. The increase comes after years of pressure from Trump, who accuses other countries in the military alliance of not spending enough. "What he is interested in is catering to the military-industrial complex of the United States," says Gilbert Achcar, emeritus professor of development studies and international relations at SOAS, University of London. "When he asks these NATO countries to increase their military expenditure, he means 'buy more U.S. weapons.' That's what he is doing. He's a salesperson for the military-industrial complex."

# “Buy More U.S. Weapons”: "Daddy" Trump Pushes Military-Industrial Complex on NATO Countries
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY)
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Nermeen Shaikh. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=0.0s)]
*  This is Democracy Now! [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=3.06s)]
*  President Trump is back in Washington after the NATO summit, where leaders agreed to increase [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=5.24s)]
*  their military spending to 5 percent of their GDP by 2035. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  The NATO summit occurred just days after Trump ordered an attack on three Iranian nuclear [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=13.86s)]
*  sites. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=18.96s)]
*  This is Trump speaking with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutter about the Israel-Iran [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=19.96s)]
*  ceasefire, which continues to hold. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  They're not going to be fighting each other. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=26.56s)]
*  They've had it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=29.4s)]
*  They've had a big fight, like two kids in a schoolyard. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=30.4s)]
*  You know they fight like hell. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=33.32s)]
*  You can't stop them. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=34.76s)]
*  Let them fight for about two, three minutes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=35.76s)]
*  Then it's easier to stop them. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=37.36s)]
*  And then daddy has to sometimes use strong language to get us off. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=38.96s)]
*  Yeah, he has strong language. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=42.36s)]
*  Every once in a while, you have to use a certain word. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=43.36s)]
*  That was President Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutter, who referred to Trump [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  as daddy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  Earlier today, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, issued a video statement where [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=51.96s)]
*  he claimed Iran had won the war and vowed that Iran would never surrender. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=56.96s)]
*  This all comes as Israel's mass killing in Gaza continues. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  Palestinian officials say Israeli forces killed another 90 Palestinians over the last 24 hours, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=66.88s)]
*  including dozens waiting near new food distribution centers. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=71.4s)]
*  To talk more about NATO, Iran and Gaza, we go to London, where we're joined by Gilbert [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=75.78s)]
*  Ameritus professor of development studies and international relations at SOAS, University [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=81.83999999999999s)]
*  of London. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  He's the author of several books, including The New Cold War, The United States, Russia [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  and China from Kosovo to Ukraine. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  His recent piece for the French paper Le Monde is headlined History's Crossroads, Gaza [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=94.96s)]
*  or the Failure of the West. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  And he's writing a new book. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=102.52s)]
*  It's just about to come out, Gaza Catastrophe, the Genocide in World Historical Perspective. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=103.63999999999999s)]
*  Professor Ashkar, it's great to have you with us. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  Let's start off by what came out of NATO. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=112.52s)]
*  Trump has been pushing this since his first term, that the 32-member countries spend far [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=115.64s)]
*  more on weapons, which means cutting social programs, green programs. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  And you have the NATO secretary-general sitting next to him, Mark Rutte, calling Trump daddy. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  Your response? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=134.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=136.96s)]
*  Good morning, Amy, and good morning, Nermeen. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=137.96s)]
*  Very nice talking to you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=143.16s)]
*  Well, that was a pathetic spectacle, what we've seen, this NATO summit. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=145.4s)]
*  That was the shortest of all NATO summits, probably. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=151.88s)]
*  I mean, it was cut to the size that fits the attention span of Donald Trump, which is no [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=154.56s)]
*  longer than two hours, seemingly. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  I mean, if you just imagine that you have 32 countries represented there, just divide [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  the two hours by 32. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=171.0s)]
*  You'll see how long it gives everyone. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  And the result was very much meant to please Donald Trump. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  This decision that you mentioned, to increase military expenditure to the level of 5% of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=186.44s)]
*  GDP, which is a very high level, even if you take into account that that means practically [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=192.4s)]
*  3.5% for strictly military expenditure and 1.5% on security and other kind of related [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=200.4s)]
*  expenditure, that's still absolutely huge. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=209.28000000000003s)]
*  And for many, many of those 32 countries of NATO, that would mean doubling, more than [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  doubling for some, their military expenditure. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=218.28000000000003s)]
*  That's absolutely huge and can only happen as it is happening in the United States, where [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=222.2s)]
*  you have record military budgets with Donald Trump and cutting in Medicaid, cutting in [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=227.88s)]
*  social expenditure of every kind. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=235.12s)]
*  You know that better than I know. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=237.6s)]
*  So that's exactly what is going to happen at the level of the whole of NATO and is happening. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=239.48s)]
*  And basically, this meeting was a convergence between two factors. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=246.08s)]
*  One, the Trump factor, of course, but we have to be aware of the fact that Trump does not [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=252.08s)]
*  really give a damn about NATO itself. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=259.08s)]
*  He doesn't regard Russia as an enemy. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=262.48s)]
*  He actually has more affinities with Vladimir Putin than most of these European leaders. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=266.92s)]
*  And the summit proved that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=273.88s)]
*  I mean, they were hardly a mention, just one of Russia. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=275.52s)]
*  What he is interested in is catering to the military industrial complex of the United [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=280.64s)]
*  States. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  And when he asked these NATO countries to increase their military expenditure, he means [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  by that, buy more US weapons. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=293.12s)]
*  That's what he is doing. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=295.56s)]
*  He's a salesperson for the military industrial complex, along with the Trump Organization [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  and other businesses. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=302.56s)]
*  With the Gulf countries, it's exactly the same. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=305.48s)]
*  He got them to promise hundreds of billions of dollars of expenditure on military purchases. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=309.12s)]
*  And so you have a convergence between that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=318.04s)]
*  And now the military industrial complex of those European countries that have a large [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=320.8s)]
*  military industry, and that is mostly countries like Germany, France, Britain, the United [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=326.08s)]
*  Kingdom, that is, and Poland. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=332.64s)]
*  And these are the countries that are now pushing for more military expenditure. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=335.4s)]
*  And you can see that most of the countries where you don't have such industries are very [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  reluctant to follow. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=346.84s)]
*  So there is this convergence of interest of military industrial complexes wanting more [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=348.84s)]
*  money, more expenditure on means of destruction at the very time when we are lacking every [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=355.08s)]
*  kind of things. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=363.52s)]
*  And just to give you an illustration of someone who got the lesson, because he is following [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=364.52s)]
*  in the footsteps of the poodle tradition of Tony Blair, and that's Keir Sarmar. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  He is happily increasing the military budget of the United Kingdom. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  And part of that is buying just a very recent decision, 12 F-35 from the United States at [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  a cost that has been estimated overall, hardware plus what comes with it, at close to $2 billion. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=395.88s)]
*  And these are planes that will be able to carry nuclear loads, but that would be under [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=406.59999999999997s)]
*  U.S. control, the use of these nuclear weapons. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  So that's also an abandonment, I mean, a further one of sovereignty. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=421.44s)]
*  So you have this from a government in Britain at the time when you have the National Health [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=426.67999999999995s)]
*  Service completely understaffed. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=431.79999999999995s)]
*  There you have Keir Sarmar explaining to the public opinion in this country, in Britain, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  that this purchase of 12 F-35s will create a huge lot of jobs. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=441.44s)]
*  I mean, this is pitiful, absolutely pitiful. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=447.2s)]
*  And Gilbert Ashkar, very quickly, you said that Trump doesn't care about NATO, but NATO [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=451.8s)]
*  seems to care an enormous amount for Trump. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=458.32s)]
*  So if you could just say a little bit about that, we just have 30 seconds. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=462.24s)]
*  Yes, I mean, it's uneven in NATO, but of course, the closer you get to the Russian [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=466.92s)]
*  borders, the more countries are afraid and need or believe that they need U.S. protection. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=476.6s)]
*  And you have some of those states, the larger states, those who have military-industrial [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=484.76s)]
*  complexes, as I said, if you look at France and Germany in particular, trying to push [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=490.32s)]
*  forward the idea of an autonomous European defense. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  But it's not very popular in NATO ranks. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=500.2s)]
*  Even Britain, as I said, does not follow at all that kind of line. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=503.79999999999995s)]
*  Now, this being said, we are witnessing the recurrence of a pattern that was very familiar [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=508.91999999999996s)]
*  where the Pentagon and the military-industrial complex in the United States would inflate [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=517.08s)]
*  considerably the so-called risk, the threat, the communist threat or whatever it is, the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=523.0s)]
*  threat from the Soviet Union in order to increase their military expenditure. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hF3WzljRY&t=529.12s)]
