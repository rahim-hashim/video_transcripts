# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” September 24, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVEiG_y4I2g)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, Democracy Now!
*  dot org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Makati has accused Israel of waging a war of
*  after Israeli airstrikes killed at least 558 people, including 50 children, and injured
*  over 1,800 since Monday.
*  It was Israel's largest attack on Lebanon in nearly two decades.
*  In Israel, Israel said today it will further accelerate its attacks on Lebanon.
*  Israel claimed the airstrikes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets, but Lebanon's health
*  ministry said Israel mostly struck civilian sites, including hospitals, medical centers
*  and ambulances.
*  Thousands of Lebanese residents have fled southern Lebanon, with many heading to Beirut.
*  The UN Human Rights Office warned Israel that sending a warning before attacking civilians
*  is not okay.
*  Hezbollah forces responded to Israel's massive attack by firing missiles at Israeli military
*  and military bases, arms factories and other areas.
*  EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned, quote, we are almost in a full-fledged war,
*  while UN spokesperson Stefan Dujariq said the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres
*  is alarmed at the large number of civilian casualties reported in Lebanon.
*  The message to the parties that are firing at each other across the blue line, to all
*  the parties involved in this conflict, is step back from the brink.
*  Stop the escalation.
*  As we just said, there is no military solution at this point that will make anyone in either
*  country any safer.
*  Israel's attack on Lebanon also killed at least one journalist, Haddi El-Sayed, a reporter
*  for Al-Mayadeen, died after Israel bombed his home in southern Lebanon.
*  Meanwhile, the Pentagon has announced more U.S. troops would be sent to the Middle East.
*  The UN Human Rights Office is calling on Israel to stop attacking schools in Gaza that provide
*  shelter to displaced Palestinians.
*  Over the past three days, Israeli attacks on schools have killed at least 32 Palestinians,
*  including 16 children.
*  The UN agency said, quote, the children of Gaza have already lost schools as a place
*  Now they're being killed in schools as they seek shelter.
*  On Monday, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa spoke at the United Nations.
*  As I speak to you, before you, our people in Gaza are enduring one of the darkest chapters
*  in modern history.
*  For nearly a year now, Israel's genocidal war has caused unprecedented loss and suffering
*  and humanitarian catastrophe.
*  At the same time, our people in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, continue to face
*  systemic threats driven by escalating settlers' violence, military raids, movement restrictions
*  and financial siege, withholding of Palestinian tax revenues.
*  ProPublica has revealed USAID and the State Department's Refugees Bureau both concluded
*  this spring that Israel had deliberately blocked deliveries of food and medicine into
*  Gaza.
*  But U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other top Biden officials rejected the
*  findings of their own agencies, the two foremost U.S. authorities on humanitarian assistance.
*  Blinken's decision allowed the U.S. to keep sending arms to Israel.
*  Under U.S. law, the government's required to cut off weapons shipments to countries
*  preventing the delivery of U.S.-backed aid.
*  U.S. prosecutors have announced plans to bring attempted assassination charges against Ryan
*  Ruth, the man accused of trying to kill Donald Trump while he was playing golf in Florida.
*  The charge carries a life sentence if convicted.
*  Prosecutors revealed Ruth wrote a letter months ago detailing his plans to kill the former
*  president.
*  The state of Missouri is scheduled to execute Marcellus Williams this evening despite significant
*  indications he was wrongfully convicted.
*  On Monday, Missouri Supreme Court and the governor, Mike Parson, declined to halt the
*  scheduled killing, even though St. Louis' top prosecutor, Wesley Bell, said in a January
*  filing that, quote, "...new evidence suggests that Mr. Williams is actually innocent," unquote.
*  The prosecutor, the jurors and the murder victim's family are all against the execution.
*  DNA found on the murder weapon did not match Williams, but instead matched another man,
*  Williams, whose African-American was convicted in 2001 of killing former St. Louis Post-Dispatch
*  reporter Leisha Gale, who was white during a robbery.
*  He was convicted by 11 white jurors and one black juror after the prosecution was allowed
*  to preemptively strike out six other prospective black jurors.
*  Last week, Democratic Congressmember Cory Bush spoke about the case on the House floor.
*  I am urging Governor Parson not to let another innocent man be murdered at the hands of the
*  state.
*  He must heed this call.
*  And as a proud co-sponsor of the Federal Death Penalty Prohibition Act, Congress must also
*  act.
*  Let's end this racist, this flawed and inhumane practice once and for all.
*  Only the U.S. Supreme Court can intervene today to start Marcellus Williams' execution.
*  We'll have more on this story later in the broadcast.
*  Climate activists disrupted a speech yesterday by President Biden's climate adviser Ali
*  Zaydi during an official Climate Week NYC event.
*  Two protesters held up a banner reading, Off Fossil Fuels, Free Palestine, as they took
*  the stage.
*  In nearby, at Citibank's headquarters in Manhattan, police arrested 31 activists as
*  they blocked the building's entrance and demanded it stop funding fossil fuel projects.
*  Protesters also called for world leaders gathering at the U.N. General Assembly to put people
*  over profits and end the war on Gaza.
*  Democracy Now! was there.
*  We'll play voices from that action later in the broadcast.
*  Activists with Sunrise Movement gathered outside Kamala Harris' Los Angeles home demanding
*  the Democratic presidential nominee take serious action on the climate.
*  The protesters brought with them a couch that had been burnt down to its frame in a nearby
*  wildfire.
*  In response, Harris posted an ex.
*  She will, quote, "...tackle the climate crisis with bold action to build a clean energy economy,
*  advance environmental justice and increase resilience to climate disasters," unquote,
*  but did not lay out any specifics, as climate activists have been demanding.
*  In more news from California, the state's Attorney General, Rob Bonta, announced California's
*  suing ExxonMobil for lying to the public about plastics being recyclable.
*  The truth here is that this myth of recycling, this decades-long campaign of deception, has
*  led to and exacerbated the global plastics pollution crisis.
*  And while plastics are not actually being recycled, the one thing that ExxonMobil does
*  recycle is its lies.
*  President Biden Monday designated the United Arab Emirates a major defense partner as the
*  U.S. seeks to deepen military cooperation in the Middle East, East Africa and Indian
*  Ocean regions.
*  The White House said in a statement this would facilitate joint training, exercises and military
*  to military collaboration between the U.S. and UAE armed forces.
*  The UAE is only the second nation to receive such designation after India.
*  The announcement came as Biden met with UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan
*  and despite mounting concerns over the UAE's backing of Sudan's paramilitary rapid support
*  forces, which has been accused of massive rights abuses, along with the Sudanese military
*  in Sudan's devastating civil war.
*  France has sent a long-band riot police force to the Caribbean island of Martinique amid
*  mounting protests over the cost of living and inequality.
*  Martinique, which has a majority black population, has been colonized by France since the 17th
*  century.
*  Residents of Martinique pay an estimated 30 to 40 percent more for food than residents
*  of France.
*  and French residents of Martinique also hold outsized political and economic power.
*  And in Senegal, authorities have recovered the remains of at least 30 people on a boat
*  off the coast of Dakar.
*  The boat was likely adrift at sea for days.
*  Senegal has become part of a common route for the increasing number of refugees being
*  forced to flee West Africa due to conflict, extreme poverty and other dire conditions.
*  Most migrants who depart from the region are attempting to reach Spain's Canary Islands
*  as they hope to resettle in Europe.
