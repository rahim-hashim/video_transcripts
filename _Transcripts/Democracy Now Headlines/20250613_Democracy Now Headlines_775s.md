Democratic Congressmember Ilhan Omar of Minnesota joins Democracy Now! to discuss the increasing authoritarianism of the Trump administration, including its crackdown on anti-ICE protesters in Los Angeles, targeting of pro-Palestine students on college campuses and plans for a massive military parade coinciding with Trump's birthday on June 14.

*  Omar of Minnesota. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=62.36000000000001s)]

*  As Congressmember Ilhan Omar joined us from the Cannon Rotunda, just a little ways down [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=76.44s)]
*  the road from where I am right now, I began by asking her about the troops in the streets [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=84.64s)]
*  in Los Angeles, the thousands of National Guard, the Marines, and tanks rolling through [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=90.96s)]
*  the Capitol ahead of President Trump's military parade, which is happening on June 14th, on [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=97.96s)]
*  his 79th birthday. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=105.64s)]
*  Abrams tanks will roll through the streets. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=108.64s)]
*  Some are saying this parade could cost taxpayers up to $100 million. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=112.64s)]
*  I asked the Congressmember to talk about the militarization of the country right now and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=119.72s)]
*  also to tie it to her memoir, which is titled This Is What America Looks Like, My Journey [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=125.4s)]
*  From Refugee to Congresswoman. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=132.44s)]
*  We are in the midst of the creation of a police state where you have masked armed men who [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=136.44s)]
*  are in plain clothes that are snatching people off the streets and willing to identify themselves. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=150.88s)]
*  You have the military being deployed in our streets. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=159.0s)]
*  My God, this is America. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=165.64s)]
*  You have states' rights being disregarded, so a constitutional crisis that's being created [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=168.32s)]
*  in front of our eyes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=177.48s)]
*  And the same week where we have a president who has deployed the military, who are trained [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=178.88s)]
*  to kill our enemies, not Americans, but our enemies, are in our streets. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  It's the same week that we are going to have a military parade. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  Can you imagine that image that is going to be coming out of our country? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=198.28s)]
*  I grew up in a dictatorship. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=204.32s)]
*  And I don't even remember ever witnessing anything like that, to have a democracy, a [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=208.48s)]
*  beacon of hope for the world to now be turned into one of the worst countries where the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=214.48s)]
*  military are in our streets without any regard for people's constitutional rights, while [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  our president is spending millions of dollars prompting himself up like a failed dictator [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  with a military parade. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=238.2s)]
*  It is really shocking, and it should be a wake-up call for all Americans to say this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=241.92s)]
*  is not the country we were born in, this is not the country we believe in, this is not [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  the country our founding fathers imagined, and this is not the country that is supported [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=254.16s)]
*  by our constitution, our ideals, our values. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  And we should all collectively be out in the streets rejecting what is taking place this week. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=263.56s)]
*  Representative Umar, President Trump has issued an extremely dire warning to anyone who protests [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=270.52s)]
*  on the day itself, Saturday, in Washington, D.C. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=277.68s)]
*  This is what he said. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=281.88s)]
*  And we're going to be celebrating big on Saturday. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=282.88s)]
*  We're going to have a lot ofâ€”and if there's any protests that want to come out, they won't [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=285.88s)]
*  be met with very big force. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=289.36s)]
*  By the way, for those people that want to protest, they're going to be met with very [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=291.24s)]
*  big force. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=294.84s)]
*  I haven't even heard about a protest. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=295.84s)]
*  But you know, this is people that hate our country, but they will be met with very heavy [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  force. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=303.23999999999995s)]
*  So, Congressman Umar, your response to what he said, and also this very dangerous point [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=304.23999999999995s)]
*  he makes, that protesters are those who hate this country. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think the person who is in the process of destroying our country should [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=315.08s)]
*  look in the mirror, and that's Trump, and notice that he is the one that has hatred [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  for the values that we have here in America and everything that we have built. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=331.0s)]
*  The reality is protest, dissent, is constitutionally protected. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=337.08s)]
*  That is everybody's first amendment right in this country. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=342.47999999999996s)]
*  And the fact that we have a president that is threatening to use heavy force, which again [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=346.88s)]
*  begs the question, is he going to send peopleâ€”you know, is the police going to be that heavy [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  force? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=361.92s)]
*  Is the military going to be that heavy force? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=362.92s)]
*  What is a heavy force? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=365.56s)]
*  And why all of a sudden are Americans not allowed to exercise their first amendment [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=367.48s)]
*  rights? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=374.36s)]
*  And again, this should be alarming to Americans to understand that we are headed towards a [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=375.84s)]
*  dangerous path, and it will be a dark day if we do not stand up for ourselves, for our [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=382.44s)]
*  constitution and for our republic. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=389.79999999999995s)]
*  And, Congressman Umar, you've actually been very vocal in another deeply unconstitutional [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=392.23999999999995s)]
*  administration has made, namely the picking up and detaining of students who protested [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=400.72s)]
*  the policies of Israel in Gaza. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=408.68s)]
*  You've said dissent is constitutionally protected, which of course it is, and that what's happening [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=412.12s)]
*  now in the U.S. is effectively a constitutional coup. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=416.68s)]
*  So if you could talk about specifically what happened to those students and what role you [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=420.12s)]
*  see the courts playing in dissenting and arguing against what the Trump administration [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=425.32s)]
*  is trying to do. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=431.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I've been tickled a little bit by the idea that as an immigrant I care about [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  the constitution. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=443.36s)]
*  More than many of my colleagues who seem to think, you know, constitutional protections [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=445.92s)]
*  in this country are only for those who are citizens and have not really read or understood [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=451.47999999999996s)]
*  that regardless of what your status is in this country that you have due process, that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=459.28s)]
*  you have access to constitutional rights. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  And what we are seeing is people who, you know, write an op-ed saying the genocide in [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=468.44s)]
*  Gaza should end, people who protest, people who have become a spokesperson for young people [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=476.24s)]
*  in college who are standing up are somehow a threat to our national security and foreign [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=484.88s)]
*  policy. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=492.48s)]
*  What they are a threat to is the status quo of continuing to do the same thing and being [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=493.92s)]
*  complacent with the genocide that's happening in Gaza with our tax dollars. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=500.52s)]
*  And I think it's really important to also remember that almost every single person that [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=506.28s)]
*  has been detained, that they did not ship in the middle of the night. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=511.64s)]
*  The courts have intervened and including people like Mahmoud Khalil, the courts have said [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=516.94s)]
*  he cannot be deported and he needs to be released and they have until the 13th of this month, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=524.4200000000001s)]
*  which is tomorrow, to facilitate his release from detention. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=531.0600000000001s)]
*  And you know, the Maryland man that they took to El Salvador to that dungeon, he has been [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=536.7s)]
*  returned. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=543.7s)]
*  And I know that they are pressing charges against him, but the reality of why they returned [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=544.74s)]
*  him is that they understood that they would be held in contempt of court because the Supreme [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=549.86s)]
*  Court said they have to facilitate his return. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=555.3000000000001s)]
*  And so they are fabricating a case in order to save face because they continue to say [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=558.54s)]
*  that they are not able to get him back into the country and quickly realized that they [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=565.38s)]
*  are going to be in trouble. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=572.1s)]
*  So all this chaos is wasting taxpayer dollar, it is creating chaos, it is jamming up our [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=574.06s)]
*  court systems that have real work in front of them, but it is not doing the thing that [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=584.9799999999999s)]
*  they want it to do because we are a constitutional republic and our constitution will hold. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=591.9799999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you, Congressmember Omar, about what happened on Monday, 75 House Democrats [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=598.98s)]
*  voting in support of a resolution that concluded a line praising ICE, expressing quote, gratitude [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=606.86s)]
*  to law enforcement officers, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=613.04s)]
*  for protecting the homeland. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=617.22s)]
*  You are trying to pass a law that holds police accountable for violence against protesters. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=619.7s)]
*  I was wondering if you can talk about the bill that you introduced in May and also the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=626.86s)]
*  Trump administration's move to lift the consent decrees holding police accountable, including [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=632.42s)]
*  your own home city of Minneapolis. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=639.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, people who take an oath to serve and protect should be held accountable when [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=642.42s)]
*  they cause harm in our communities. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=650.1800000000001s)]
*  And right now, the only remedy that exists for a lot of people when police brutalize [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=652.62s)]
*  them is to sue the city and get some money while that police officer continues to be [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=657.74s)]
*  on the force and does not face any criminal charges. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=664.02s)]
*  Just the fact that you wear a uniform and wear a badge does not mean you have a right [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=667.46s)]
*  to harm people who are out doing, you know, participating in protests. That is their constitutional [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=672.5s)]
*  right to be able to do so. So our legislation gets at that. It is unfortunate that, you [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=682.54s)]
*  know, some Democrats keep falling into this trap in supporting legislation because they [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=690.34s)]
*  do not have the ability to stand up for what they believe. And that is why we are lacking [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=696.76s)]
*  credibility as a party because, you know, when we say we are for the protection of immigrants, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=704.26s)]
*  that we are for creating a humane immigration policy that we want to protect our neighbors, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=711.58s)]
*  and then you have, you know, members of the Democratic Party in Congress take that vote [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=718.34s)]
*  that they took, it becomes a little hard for people to believe that we are sincere in the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=724.66s)]
*  policies that we push for. So I do hope that my colleagues realize that they are causing [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=730.62s)]
*  more harm to the credibility of Democrats when they are wishy-washy on some of these [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=737.62s)]
*  policies than they are doing to help the country secure its borders and have an immigration [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=744.7s)]
*  policy that is just. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=752.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7r9W1QGqSE&t=767.62s)]
