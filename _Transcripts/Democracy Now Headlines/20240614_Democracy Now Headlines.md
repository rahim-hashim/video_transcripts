*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Children in Gaza continue to die of hunger.
*  On Thursday, the World Health Organization reported 32 deaths from malnutrition, most
*  of whom were children under 5.
*  The findings came as UNICEF said nearly 3,000 children have been cut off from treatment
*  for moderate and severe acute malnutrition in southern Gaza, putting them at risk of
*  death.
*  Meanwhile, the U.N. reports violence against children caught in armed conflict last year
*  reached extreme levels, with a 21 percent increase in extreme violations.
*  The surge in violence came amidst Israel's withering assault on the Gaza Strip now in
*  its ninth month.
*  Overnight, Israeli forces pushed deeper into the Shiburah refugee camp in southern Gaza.
*  Elsewhere, one person was killed and three children wounded after Israel bombed their
*  home in the Berej refugee camp.
*  Israeli airstrikes in northern Gaza City killed at least 14 people.
*  Meanwhile, Israeli forces killed at least three Palestinians in overnight raids in the
*  West Bank.
*  The U.S. Supreme Court Thursday ruled unanimously to maintain access to the abortion pill Mefeper
*  Stone, which is used in nearly two-thirds of all U.S. abortions.
*  The decision comes as a relief to providers and patients across the nation.
*  But advocates warned the far-right dominated court's ruling on the FDA's authority
*  to regulate the pill was purely on procedural grounds and could even offer a roadmap for
*  future challenges.
*  Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the court's decision, quote,
*  The plaintiffs have sincere legal, moral, ideological and policy objections," suggesting
*  the proper venue for their case could be with the president, lawmakers or federal regulators.
*  We'll have more on this ruling after headlines with Professor Michelle Goodwin.
*  In other Supreme Court news, justices ruled 8-1 in favor of Starbucks, which was accused
*  of unlawfully firing seven workers at a Memphis store after they led a campaign to organize
*  a union.
*  Justice Katanji Brown Jackson was the sole dissenter.

*  underscores how the economy is rigged against working people all the way up to the Supreme
*  Court," unquote.

*  G7 host and far-right Italian President Giorgio Maloney said Russian assets frozen after its
*  2022 invasion of Ukraine would be used to finance the deal.
*  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky joined the talks, where he met with President Biden
*  and signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement with the U.S.
*  Biden announced the agreement at a joint news conference.
*  A lasting peace for Ukraine must be underwritten by Ukraine's own ability to defend itself
*  now and to deter future aggression anytime in the future.
*  The United States is going to help ensure that Ukraine can do both, not by sending American
*  troops to fight in Ukraine, but by providing weapons and ammunition, expanding intelligence
*  sharing, continuing to train brave Ukrainian troops at bases in Europe and the United States.
*  On Thursday, at least six people were killed and 11 others wounded when a Russian missile
*  struck the city of Krivory in southern Ukraine.
*  Much of Ukraine is experiencing extended blackouts as Russia's military increases attacks on
*  the energy grid.
*  As G7 leaders gathered for a lavish banquet Thursday evening, protesters gathered to host
*  what they called a poor dinner.
*  A world with people who are getting richer and richer and a world, a planet that is getting
*  poorer and poorer, crossed by wars, death, destruction, climate change.
*  So a planet that is going towards death, and they don't seem to care.
*  We are on the eve of the Third World War.
*  Russian authorities say Wall Street Journal reporter Ivan Gorshkovich will stand trial
*  on espionage charges in Yekaterinburg, where he was arrested in March last year.
*  The Wall Street Journal CEO and publisher slammed the what he called a sham trial, adding,
*  quote, journalism is not a crime if convicted Gorshkovich faces up to 20 years in prison.
*  Christophe Deloire, the head of Reporters Without Borders for the last 12 years, has
*  died at the age of 53 from complications of brain cancer.
*  Deloire fought tirelessly to defend press freedom and persecuted journalists.
*  A year ago, he appeared on Democracy Now! where I asked him about Ivan Gorshkovich.
*  Ivan Gorshkovich is clearly a Russian state hostage, a sort of institutional hostage.
*  If we know how Putin succeeded in the past decade, he finalized it right after the beginning
*  of the war, how he succeeded to distinguish, to re-suppress pluralism, independent journalism,
*  to provoke an extinction in his own country.
*  To see our full interview with Christophe Deloire, you can go to democracynow.org.
*  Here in New York, climate protests continued for a fourth day outside City Group headquarters
*  Thursday, where police arrested 56 people, many of them elders.
*  Thursday's protests, led by the group Third Act, came under the banner of the Rocking
*  Chair Rebellion, which is part of the summer of heat series of actions.

*  fighter planes in 2021 that the U.S. is now repaying.
*  In Germany, climate experts say the high-level U.N. talks in Bonn have failed to make any
*  progress on the global response to the climate catastrophe.
*  This is Tasneem Essap of Climate Action Network International.
*  TASNEEM ESSAP, UNHCR COUNCIL FORCES, U.S. COUNCIL FORCES, UNHCR COUNCIL FORCES, UNHCR
*  COUNCIL FORCES, UNHCR COUNCIL FORCES, UNHCR COUNCIL FORCES, UNHCR COUNCIL FORCES, UNHCR
*  COUNCIL FORCES, UNHCR COUNCIL FORCES, UNHCR COUNCIL FORCES, UNHCR COUNCIL FORCES, UNHCR
*  ended up with no results.
*  And this is caused by a breakdown in the negotiations once again on finance.
*  Rich nations, as they have done before, are not willing to make progress on their financial
*  obligations to developing countries.
*  This comes as record-breaking extreme weather is being reported around the world.
*  The country and Athens shut down the Acropolis and other major sites during peak hours, as
*  Greece records its earliest-ever seasonal heat wave.
*  In Puerto Rico, the mayor of San Juan declared a state of emergency as the island reported
*  widespread power outages, leaving some 350,000 customers without electricity Wednesday night
*  amid soaring temperatures.
*  Puerto Rico's power grid was taken over by the Canadian-American company Luma Energy
*  in 2021, despite widespread public opposition.
*  The French government has been
*  forced to close the deal, but the negotiations have continued to suffer persistent blackouts,
*  yet pay some of the highest electricity rates in the United States.
*  French President Emmanuel Macron has suspended voting reform in New Caledonia to allow,
*  quote, a return to order, unquote.
*  On a visit to the Pacific archipelago last month, Macron vowed to go ahead with the reform,
*  which would grant voting rights to French residents of the colonized territory.
*  The procedure could not go ahead until a new legislature is elected.
*  At least eight people have been killed in the recent unrest.
*  Much of New Caledonia's indigenous Kanak community is seeking full independence from
*  France.

*  Black Wall Street, the thriving African-American neighborhood of Greenwood.
*  Viola Fletcher and Lessie Benningfield Randall are 110 and 109 years old.
*  Their lawyers say they will request a rehearing by the Oklahoma Supreme Court and called on
*  the Justice Department to open investigation into the massacre under the Emmett Till Unsolved
*  Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007.
*  Former President Donald Trump returned to the U.S. Capitol on Thursday for the first
*  time since the January 6, 2021, insurrection.
*  Trump met with Republican lawmakers, among other things.
*  He reportedly said, quote, Milwaukee, where we're having our convention, is a horrible
*  city, unquote.
*  Trump narrowly lost Wisconsin to Biden in 2000 and has since falsely claimed election
*  fraud in the state.
*  This comes as Politico reports Trump called House Speaker Mike Johnson after he was convicted
*  of 34 felonies in New York and asked the GOP leader to help overturn the verdict and to
*  help punish the Justice Department.
*  President Trump turns 78 years old today.
*  And in Brazil, protesters took to the streets on Thursday after lawmakers advanced a bill
*  this week that would equate all abortions with homicide if performed after the 22nd
*  week of gestation, with punishments of up to 20 years in prison.
*  This is Rio Councilmember Monica Benicio.
*  We will not accept the setback.
*  We will not accept the conservative government negotiating spurious policies over our lives.
*  We will continue to advance until legal abortion is a guaranteed right in Brazil.
*  Abortion is only legal in Brazil in cases of rape and encephaly or a life-threatening
*  risk to the patient.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
