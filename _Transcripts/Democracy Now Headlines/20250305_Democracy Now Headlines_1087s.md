President Donald Trump delivered the longest presidential address to a joint session of Congress in modern history Tuesday night, laying out his vision for the next four years as he defended his many executive actions to dismantle large portions of the federal government. For an hour and 40 minutes, Trump repeatedly lied and exaggerated his accomplishments and his opponents' failures, deploying racist and dehumanizing language to describe immigrants, LGBTQ people and his critics. Trump heaped praise on billionaire Elon Musk and his efforts to slash entire government agencies. The speech was "a declaration of war against the American people, including Trump voters, in favor of the super-rich and the giant corporations," says Ralph Nader, longtime consumer advocate, corporate critic and former presidential candidate.

*  He's working very hard. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=107.36s)]
*  He didn't need this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=109.2s)]
*  He didn't need this. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=110.2s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=112.68s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=113.68s)]
*  Some Democrats laughed and pointed at Elon Musk when President Trump made this comment [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=114.72s)]
*  later in his speech. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=119.72s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=121.2s)]
*  And the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=123.2s)]
*  During his speech, President Trump repeatedly attacked the trans and immigrant communities, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=133.23999999999998s)]

*  We also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=147.56s)]
*  We strongly support your right to determine your own future. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  And if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=159.2s)]
*  We need Greenland for national security and even international security. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=162.72s)]
*  And we're working with everybody involved to try and get it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=167.84s)]
*  But we need it really for international world security. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=171.44s)]
*  And I think we're going to get it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=175.8s)]
*  One way or the other, we're going to get it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=177.66s)]
*  During Trump's 100-minute address, Democratic lawmakers held up signs in protest reading [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=180.64s)]
*  this is not normal, save Medicaid and Musk steals. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=186.0s)]
*  One Democrat, Congressmember Al Green of Texas, was removed from the chamber for protesting [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=191.28s)]
*  the president. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=196.84s)]
*  Likewise, small business optimism saw its single largest one-month gain ever recorded, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=197.84s)]
*  a 41-point jump. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=207.0s)]
*  Members are directed to uphold and maintain the quorum in the House and to cease any further [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=215.12s)]
*  disruptions. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=220.56s)]
*  That's your warning. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=221.56s)]
*  Members are engaging in willful and continuing breach of the quorum, and the chair is prepared [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=228.88s)]
*  to direct the sergeant-at-arms to restore order to the joint session. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=233.16s)]
*  Mr. Green, take your seat. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=239.8s)]
*  Take your seat, sir. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=245.8s)]
*  Take your seat. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=246.8s)]
*  Take your seat. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  Finding that members continue to engage in willful and concerted disruption of proper [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=252.04000000000002s)]
*  decorum, the chair now directs the sergeant-at-arms to restore order. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=256.56s)]
*  Remove this gentleman from the chamber. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=260.04s)]
*  That was House Speaker Mike Johnson, who called in security to take Texas Democratic [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=277.8s)]
*  Congressmember Al Green out. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=292.2s)]
*  Afterwards, Green spoke to reporters after being removed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  The president said he had a mandate, and I was making it clear to the president that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=298.32s)]
*  he has no mandate to cut Medicaid. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=304.36s)]
*  I have people who are very fearful. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=308.24s)]
*  These are poor people, and they have only Medicaid in their lives when it comes to their [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  health care. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=316.52s)]
*  And I want him to know that his budget calls for deep cuts in Medicaid. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=317.52s)]
*  He needs to save Medicaid, protect it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=322.56s)]
*  We need to raise the cap on Social Security. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=325.4s)]
*  There's a possibility that it's going to be hurt, and we've got to protect Medicare. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=328.08s)]
*  These are the safety net programs that people in my congressional district depend on. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=332.58s)]
*  And this president seems to care less about them and more about the number of people that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=338.18s)]
*  he can remove from the various programs that have been so helpful to so many people. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=343.82s)]
*  Texas Democratic Congressmember Al Green, we begin today's show with Ralph Nader, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=349.9s)]
*  the longtime consumer advocate, corporate critic, former presidential candidate. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=354.06s)]
*  Ralph Nader is founder of the Capitol Citizen newspaper's most recent lead article in [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=358.66s)]
*  the new issue of Capitol Hill Citizen, is titled Democratic Party Apologized to America [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=363.18s)]
*  for Ushering Trump Back In. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=369.14s)]
*  He is also the author of the forthcoming book Let's Start the Revolution, Tools for Displacing [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=372.34000000000003s)]
*  the Corporate State and Building a Country that Works for the People. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=377.98s)]
*  Medicaid, Social Security, Medicare, all these different programs. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=382.54s)]
*  Ralph Nader, respond overall to President Trump's longest congressional address in [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=388.22s)]
*  modern history. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=395.5s)]
*  Well, it was also a declaration of war against the American people, including Trump voters, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=396.5s)]
*  in favor of the super-rich and the giant corporations. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=403.98s)]
*  What Trump did last night was set a record for lies, delusionary fantasies, predictions [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=409.94s)]
*  of future broken promises, a rerun of his first term, boasts about progress that don't [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=420.02s)]
*  exist. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=428.54s)]
*  In practice, he has launched a trade war. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=429.54s)]
*  He has launched an arms race with China and Russia. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=433.66s)]
*  He has perpetuated and even worsened the genocidal support against the Palestinians. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=439.66s)]
*  He never mentioned the Palestinians once, and he's taken Biden's genocidal policies [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=448.78000000000003s)]
*  one step further by demanding the evacuation of Palestinians from Gaza. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=455.34000000000003s)]
*  Taking it as a whole, Amy, what we're seeing here defies most of dictionary adjectives. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=462.98s)]
*  What Trump and Musk and Vance and the supine Republicans are doing are installing an imperial, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=474.26s)]
*  militaristic, domestic dictatorship that is going to end up in a police state. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=482.78s)]
*  You can see his appointments are, yes, people bent on suppression of civil liberties, civil [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=489.90000000000003s)]
*  rights. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=497.94s)]
*  You can see his breakthrough after over 120 years of announcing conquest of Panama Canal. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=499.42s)]
*  He's basically said one way or another he's going to take Greenland. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=509.34000000000003s)]
*  These are not just imperial controls of countries overseas or overthrowing them. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=514.86s)]
*  It's actually seizing land. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=521.98s)]
*  Now on the Greenland thing, Greenland is a province of Denmark, which is a member of [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=523.86s)]
*  NATO. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=531.26s)]
*  He is ready to basically conquer a part of Denmark in violation of Section 5 of NATO. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=532.26s)]
*  At the same time that he has displayed full-throated support for a hardcore communist dictator, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=545.26s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, who started out with the Russian version of the CIA under the Soviet Union [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=552.56s)]
*  and now has over 20 years of communist dictatorship, allied, of course, with a number of oligarchs, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=561.04s)]
*  a kind of kleptocracy. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=571.56s)]
*  And then the Republicans are buying all this in Congress. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=574.28s)]
*  This is complete reversal of everything that the Republicans stood for against communist [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=577.64s)]
*  dictators. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=585.24s)]
*  So what we're seeing here is a phony program of government efficiency ripping apart people's [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=586.5999999999999s)]
*  programs. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=597.12s)]
*  The attack on Social Security is new. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=598.68s)]
*  It lies about millions of people aged 110, 120, getting Social Security checks. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=601.88s)]
*  That's a new attack. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=610.68s)]
*  He left Social Security alone in his first term, but now he's going after. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=611.84s)]
*  So what they're going to do is cut Medicaid and cut other social safety nets in order [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=618.24s)]
*  to pay for another tax cut for the super rich and the corporation. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=624.92s)]
*  Throwing in no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security benefits, which will, of course, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=631.7199999999999s)]
*  further increase the deficit and give the lie to his statement that he wants a balanced [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=640.0799999999999s)]
*  budget. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=647.56s)]
*  So we're dealing with a deranged, unstable, pathological liar who's getting away with [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=648.56s)]
*  it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=655.7199999999999s)]
*  And the question is, how does he get away with it year after year? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=656.7199999999999s)]
*  Because the Democratic Party has basically collapsed. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=660.72s)]
*  They don't know how to deal with a criminal recidivist, a person who has hired workers [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=663.84s)]
*  without documents and exploited them, a person who's a bigot against immigrants, including [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=672.88s)]
*  legal immigrants, who are performing totally critical tasks in home health care, processing [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=679.6s)]
*  poultry, meat, and half of the construction workers in Texas are undocumented workers. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=686.4s)]
*  So as a bully, he doesn't go after the construction industry in Texas. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=693.9599999999999s)]
*  He picks out individuals. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=698.3s)]
*  I thought the most disgraceful thing, Amy, yesterday was his use of these unfortunate [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=700.0799999999999s)]
*  people who suffered as props, holding one up after another. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  But there were also Trump's crutches to cover up his contradictory behavior. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=713.0s)]
*  So he praises the police yesterday, but he pardoned over 600 people who attacked violently [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=718.3s)]
*  the police on January 6 and were convicted and imprisoned as a result. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=725.56s)]
*  And he led them out of prison. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=730.6s)]
*  I thought the most heart-rending thing was that 13-year-old child who wanted to be a [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=733.32s)]
*  police officer when he grew up being held up twice by his father. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=741.0s)]
*  And he was so bewildered as to what was going on. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=747.4s)]
*  And Trump's use of these people was totally reprehensible and should be called out. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=753.04s)]
*  Now, more basically, the real inefficiencies in government they're ignoring because they're [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=760.68s)]
*  kleptocrats. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=765.92s)]
*  They're ignoring corporate crimes on Medicaid, Medicare, tens of billions of dollars every [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=767.3199999999999s)]
*  year ripping off Medicare, ripping off government contracts such as defense contracts. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=774.3199999999999s)]
*  He's ignoring hundreds of billions of dollars of corporate welfare, including that dealt [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=782.52s)]
*  out to Elon Musk, subsidies, handouts, giveaways, bailouts, you name it. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=787.92s)]
*  And he's ignoring the bloated military budget, which he is supporting the Republicans in [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=794.92s)]
*  actually increasing the military budget more than the generals have asked for. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=800.92s)]
*  Ralph, if I can interrupt, I just need to‚Äî [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=807.92s)]
*  Ralph, I wanted to ask you specifically about Medicaid and Medicare. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=812.92s)]
*  You mentioned the cuts to these safety net programs. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=819.92s)]
*  What about Medicaid, especially the crisis in this country in long-term care? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=824.92s)]
*  What do you see happening in this Trump administration, especially with the Republican majority in [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=828.92s)]
*  Congress? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=833.92s)]
*  Well, they're going to slash. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=834.92s)]
*  They're going to move to slash Medicaid, which serves over 71 million people, including millions [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=835.92s)]
*  of Trump voters who should be reconsidering their vote as the days pass because they're [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=842.92s)]
*  being exploited in red states, blue states, everywhere as well. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=849.92s)]
*  Yeah, they have to cut tens of billions of dollars a year from Medicaid to pay for the [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=854.92s)]
*  tax cut. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=863.92s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=864.92s)]
*  Now they're going after Social Security. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=867.92s)]
*  Who knows what the next step will be on Medicare? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=869.92s)]
*  They're leaving Americans totally defenseless by slashing meat and poultry and food inspection [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=872.92s)]
*  laws, auto safety. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=880.92s)]
*  They're exposing people to climate violence by cutting FEMA, the rescue agency. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=882.92s)]
*  They're cutting forest rangers that deal with wildfires. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=893.92s)]
*  They're cutting protections against pandemics and epidemics by slashing and ravaging and [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=898.92s)]
*  suppressing free speech in scientific circles like CDC and National Institutes of Health. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=907.92s)]
*  They're leaving the American people defenseless. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=915.92s)]
*  And who are the Democrats on this? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=918.92s)]
*  I mean, look at Senator Slotkin's response. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=920.92s)]
*  It was a typical rerun of a feeble, weak, Democratic rebuttal. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=923.92s)]
*  She couldn't get herself, just like the Democrats in 2024, which led to Trump's victory. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=929.92s)]
*  They can't get themselves, Juan, to talk specifically and authentically about raising the minimum [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=937.92s)]
*  wage, expanding health care, cracking down on corporate crooks that are bleeding out the [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=944.92s)]
*  incomes of hard pressed American workers and the poor. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=952.92s)]
*  They can't get themselves to talk about increasing frozen Social Security budgets for 50 years. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=959.92s)]
*  The 200 Democrats supported raising, but Nancy Pelosi kept them when she was speaker from [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=967.92s)]
*  taking John Larson's bill to the House floor. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=975.92s)]
*  That's why they lose. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=980.92s)]
*  Look at her speech. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=981.92s)]
*  It was so vague in general. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=983.92s)]
*  They chose her because she was in the national security stage. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=985.92s)]
*  She was a former CIA. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=988.92s)]
*  They chose her because they wanted to promote the losing version of the Democratic Party [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=990.92s)]
*  instead of choosing Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, the most popular poll politician in America today. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=996.92s)]
*  That's who they chose. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=1004.92s)]
*  So as long as the Democrats monopolize the opposition and crush third party efforts to push them [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=1006.92s)]
*  into more progressive realms, the Republican plutocratic Wall Street war machine declaration of [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=1013.92s)]
*  war against American people will continue. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=1023.92s)]
*  We're heading into the most serious crisis in American history. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=1025.92s)]
*  There's no comparison. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=1029.92s)]
*  Ralph Nader, we're going to have to leave it there, but of course we're going to continue to cover these issues. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=1030.92s)]
*  And I also wanted to wish you, Ralph, a happy 91st birthday. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=1036.92s)]
*  Ralph Nader. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKSu_Ir6uU&t=1040.92s)]
