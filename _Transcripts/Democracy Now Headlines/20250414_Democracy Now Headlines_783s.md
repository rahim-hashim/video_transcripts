Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele is meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, part of a growing alliance between the two right-wing leaders. In recent months, El Salvador has imprisoned hundreds of people for the Trump administration who were expelled from the United States with little or no due process, ending up in the brutal mega-prison known as CECOT. One of those men is Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom the Trump administration deported despite a protective order meant to prevent his removal from the country. The Trump administration has so far refused to bring Abrego Garcia back, despite a unanimous Supreme Court ruling ordering the government to "facilitate" his return. Bukele, who has described himself as "the world's coolest dictator," has ruled for years under a state of emergency in El Salvador, imprisoning tens of thousands of people without trial as part of a supposed war on gangs. "Never did I imagine that we would be in a situation where the Trump administration, the United States, is looking to El Salvador, to the Bukele administration, saying, 'Huh, we kind of like what you are doing,'" says Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa, who just returned from a reporting trip to El Salvador.

*  When the Trump administration earlier ignored federal Judge James Boasberg's order that, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=54.24s)]

*  And that was retweeted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=71.80000000000001s)]

*  on how exactly this would happen. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=92.48s)]
*  The husband and father of three has no criminal record. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=94.88s)]
*  President Trump was questioned by a reporter Friday about Kilmar Abrego Garcia. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  Is that the one that was not Tren de Oroquo, but he was MS-13? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=102.96s)]
*  The one that they've said needs to come back. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=107.96s)]
*  No, but was he MS-13? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=110.96s)]
*  Because I only know by that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=112.96s)]
*  I mean, I don't know which one, but if the Supreme Court said bring somebody back, I would do that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=114.96s)]
*  I respect the Supreme Court. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=119.96s)]
*  And the lower court judge as well. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=121.96s)]
*  He's been asking for daily updates. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=123.96s)]
*  I'm not talking about the lower court. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=124.96s)]
*  I have great respect for the Supreme Court. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=126.96s)]
*  So, I'm not totally well versed as to the specific case, but if they said to bring him back, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=129.96s)]
*  I would tell them to bring him back. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=137.96s)]
*  For more, we're joined by Mariana Josa, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, founder of Futuro Media, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=139.96s)]
*  host of Latino USA, co-executive producer of the Pulitzer Prize-winning podcast Suave, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=146.96s)]
*  which is starting its new season this week, and we're going to talk about that soon. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=152.96s)]
*  But first, it's great to have you in studio. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=157.96s)]
*  Talk about your reporting trip to El Salvador and today's meeting between President Trump and President Bukele of El Salvador. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=160.96s)]
*  Amy, it's great to be with you. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=169.96s)]
*  I was in El Salvador several weeks ago. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=171.96s)]
*  I went down to do a story, actually, that has to do with women behind bars. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=174.96s)]
*  We'll talk about that when we break that story coming up soon. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=178.96s)]
*  So, I was attempting to get access to the women's prison, as well as Secote. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=182.96s)]
*  And explain what Secote is. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=188.96s)]
*  Secote is a new prison. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=190.96s)]
*  It is a, how can you say it? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=192.96s)]
*  It's like an industrialized form of prison making, right? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=196.96s)]
*  Super new, built up, lights on all the time. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=201.96s)]
*  But the problem is not only the way in which the prison is constructed, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=206.96s)]
*  but because of Bukele and basically de facto martial law in El Salvador. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=211.96s)]
*  When you are put in that prison, you have no due process. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=217.96s)]
*  You have no visitors, Amy, no visitors. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=220.96s)]
*  So when we attempted to go to another prison, Ilo Pango Prison, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=223.96s)]
*  which used to be the big prison until it was replaced by Secote, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=227.96s)]
*  that's actually right on a major thorough way. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=232.96s)]
*  But there were no people coming in and out. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=235.96s)]
*  And I just think it's really important for people to understand that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=237.96s)]
*  When you are put in prison in El Salvador, you do not have rights for people to come and visit you. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=240.96s)]
*  Almost no right to even get a lawyer. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=245.96s)]
*  It is extraordinary. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=248.96s)]
*  And the only person ultimately, Amy, it's going to sound strange, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=250.96s)]
*  I know it sounded strange to me, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=253.96s)]
*  was you get permission to get into Secote by President Bukele. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=256.96s)]
*  So that would basically be like President Trump having to give you access to any federal prison that you want to visit. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=262.96s)]
*  It's an extraordinary hold on power that he controls who will be able to go into that prison. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=268.96s)]
*  And any journalist who goes has these mixed feelings because they know that they are being used [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=275.96s)]
*  by the Bukele administration to put images out there that put fear in a lot of people. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=280.96s)]
*  Let us be clear that the people who were first taken by the United States and sent to El Salvador, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=285.96s)]
*  those people, the majority are not criminals. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=291.96s)]
*  They do not have a criminal record. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=296.96s)]
*  So this is why it should be of concern to everybody that these are just people who are, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=298.96s)]
*  by the way, they're not being deported, Amy. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=302.96s)]
*  Deported means you have gone through a legal process. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=305.96s)]
*  You have seen a judge. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=310.96s)]
*  You have been formally deported. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=312.96s)]
*  These people were removed. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=315.96s)]
*  It's another way of saying it, but they were removed. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=317.96s)]
*  No due process, no seeing a judge. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=319.96s)]
*  Then some people say, well, isn't that really that they were kidnapped and are now being held in El Salvador? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=322.96s)]
*  And some people would go further and say, weren't they trafficked? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=328.96s)]
*  If they do not know, if they don't have access to their documents, they don't know where they're going. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=332.96s)]
*  They don't know who's taking them. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=337.96s)]
*  They've been told not to speak to anyone and they don't know when they're going to be released. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=339.96s)]
*  That is what is the label for somebody who's been trafficked. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=342.96s)]
*  It's amazing to watch the video footage of the men being taken to the prison. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=345.96s)]
*  It was all, I mean, we know how Trump feels about reality television, so carefully filmed. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=351.96s)]
*  And the images of Kristi Noem, the former South Dakota governor, head of Homeland Security, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=356.96s)]
*  with her $75,000 Rolex standing in front of these caged men. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=362.96s)]
*  This is Salvadoran President Naib Bukele addressing an adoring crowd at CPAC 2024 in Washington, D.C. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=368.96s)]
*  We did the unthinkable to cleanse our society. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=377.96s)]
*  We arrested the terrorists, but we have to remove corrupt judges and corrupt attorneys and prosecutors. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=381.96s)]
*  These corrupt judges and prosecutors were setting the gang members free. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=395.96s)]
*  And Nancy Pelosi. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=400.96s)]
*  And it wasn't just the gangs. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=404.96s)]
*  The corrupt system work in tandem with the so-called international community, the NGOs, and of course the fake news, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=407.96s)]
*  just like it happens here in the United States. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=415.96s)]
*  So, as you have Bukele going after the NGOs, the fake news, the same language Trump uses, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=418.96s)]
*  Bukele calling himself the coolest dictator. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=425.96s)]
*  The significance of this meeting today, Maria, who's modeling themselves on who? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=429.96s)]
*  So, Amy, you and I have been covering the story of El Salvador and the United States involvement in politics in El Salvador since the 1980s. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=435.96s)]
*  When the U.S. funded death squads, a paramilitary organization. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=444.96s)]
*  There were four marrying old nuns who were raped and murdered by men who were in fact de facto trained by the United States. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=447.96s)]
*  Many young people don't know this. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=454.96s)]
*  But never, Amy, did I imagine that we would be in a situation where the Trump administration, the United States, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=456.96s)]
*  is looking to El Salvador, to the Bukele administration, saying, huh, we kind of like what you're doing. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=462.96s)]
*  Maybe we should take a cue from you. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=469.96s)]
*  Why don't we just declare our own form of martial law and deny due process not just to people who were not born in this country, but to everyone. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=471.96s)]
*  But it's important to know that like any dictatorship, it is not forever. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=478.96s)]
*  And what's happened now because of Bukele's administration allowing itself to be used by the Trump administration to house undocumented people, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=485.96s)]
*  there are cracks that are starting to show. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=494.96s)]
*  You would not have seen a protest against Bukele in El Salvador. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=497.96s)]
*  You have in the past month. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=500.96s)]
*  So people are taking to the streets. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=502.96s)]
*  The cracks are beginning to show because you cannot have a carceral country without people saying, hey, this is too much. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=504.96s)]
*  You have taken people with no due process who are innocent and holding them behind bars for decades. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=511.96s)]
*  And hundreds of people have died in Salvador's jails and their prisons. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=517.96s)]
*  Yeah. And so so there are people who are dying right now, Amy, on US territory in detention camps or when they are attempting to cross the border. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=522.96s)]
*  So death because you're an immigrant, because you were not born in this country, is a reality for people here. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=533.96s)]
*  And the horror that, you know, in our country now there are firing firing squads. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=539.96s)]
*  So it is a very dystopian. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=544.96s)]
*  I have to say, being in El Salvador, where you only use dollars, it's just it's El Salvador. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=546.96s)]
*  But the only currency that is used is dollars. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=553.96s)]
*  It's very strange. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=556.96s)]
*  I do know how quarters are going to survive in the world. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=558.96s)]
*  It's because people use quarters to buy pupusas in El Salvador. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=560.96s)]
*  And it's just like you're using American dollars. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=564.96s)]
*  Also, Bukele is a mastermind of public relations. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=567.96s)]
*  He's attempting to change the entire country of El Salvador to a surf city. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=571.96s)]
*  Go surfing. Just go surfing. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=577.96s)]
*  The country of El Salvador is called Surf City. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=579.96s)]
*  Basically, that is the new public relations. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=582.96s)]
*  And he's selling this to American retirees to go and buy up land in El Salvador and make that their home of retirement. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=584.96s)]
*  So when we see their men with their heads shaved not having due process in the United States, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=591.96s)]
*  most don't know most of the names of the hundreds of people who were sent. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=598.96s)]
*  And this question of whether Kilmar will be released, you can't have a higher meeting than President Trump with Bukele today. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=602.96s)]
*  The U.S. paying millions of dollars to imprison the refugees, if you will, those who are kidnapped. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=610.96s)]
*  We'll see what happens. We'll follow this up tomorrow. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=619.96s)]
*  But the effect it's having on immigrant communities in the United States, like Chicago, what cancelled its Cinco de Mayo? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=621.96s)]
*  You know what, Amy, that was first of all, the fact that the United States government is resisting returning Kilmar should be of concern for every single one of us. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=627.96s)]
*  For myself, not being born in this country, there's a heightened interest. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=636.96s)]
*  But everyone should care about the fact that the United States is just taking people and removing them without any due process. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=639.96s)]
*  When I read that Chicago, my hometown, where I was raised, South Side, that they are canceling the Cinco de Mayo celebration and parade. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=645.96s)]
*  And what struck me was we don't have anything to celebrate. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=655.96s)]
*  And this is something, Amy, that as a journalist covering last year, deeply covering the Latino and Latina vote and being in Latino and Latina communities and hearing Latino voters saying, oh, we like Trump because our economy is terrible and he's a great businessman. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=658.96s)]
*  And I want to be like him. Let's get him in. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=673.96s)]
*  And it's like, did you not? Did you already forget what happened? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=675.96s)]
*  This is not new. Our communities have lived through this. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=679.96s)]
*  But the heightened police state that all of us are living in, by the way, Amy, everyone is only talking about like focusing on immigrant communities. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=682.96s)]
*  We already know that American citizens are being taken out of the country mistakenly being deported. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=690.96s)]
*  Oh, whoops. Again, whoopsie. We know now that the lawyer who admitted the Justice Department lawyer that they're being so-called deported by mistake has been suspended, put on leave. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=695.96s)]
*  Correct. So everyone in the country now, Amy, has to be thinking, do I have a copy of my passport with me? Where's my birth certificate? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=707.96s)]
*  Wow. Where is my birth certificate? Do I know? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=716.96s)]
*  It is not enough in the United States now to be walking around with your driver's license. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=719.96s)]
*  And that is the thing, Amy, that I have been talking about for decades, which is, oh, you think it's only impacting people like me who are immigrants? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=724.96s)]
*  It's impacting you. Who were the secret police who were taking protesters off the streets in Seattle and Portland at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=732.96s)]
*  They were Border Patrol. What is the largest law enforcement agency in the United States? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=742.96s)]
*  Border Patrol. Which has the least amount of oversight? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=747.96s)]
*  Border Patrol. That impacts all of us, not just those of us who are not born in the United States. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=751.96s)]
*  This is a conversation we will continue. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=756.96s)]
*  Mariana hosts as a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and founder of Futuro Media. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=759.96s)]
*  She's the host of Latino USA, co-executive producer of the Pulitzer Prize-winning podcast Suave. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBPZh0FQlQ&t=764.96s)]
