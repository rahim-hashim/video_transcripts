As a Republican-sponsored budget bill advances through Congress, we hear from Bishop William Barber about how the bill hurts low-income people. “It is about death-dealing and destruction to the poor and the elderly and the youth of our country,” says Barber, citing the bill’s cuts to essential social services like Medicaid and paralleling those cuts to the government’s funding of defense and deportation initiatives. “We have to start talking about this budget as a form of social and political murder.” Barber has been arrested with other faith leaders twice in the past month while protesting cuts, including in the Capitol Rotunda.

*  AMY GOODMAN, The War and Peace Report. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=23.6s)]
*  President Trump made a rare visit to Capitol Hill to push House Republicans to support [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=24.6s)]
*  a sweeping budget bill that gives massive tax breaks to the rich while slashing spending [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=28.72s)]
*  for Medicaid, food stamps and subsidies for clean energy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=34.04s)]
*  One estimate shows nearly 14 million people could lose health coverage. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=37.84s)]
*  A new analysis by the Congressional Budget Office says the bill will also trigger $535 [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=42.68s)]
*  billion in Medicare cuts. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=49.68s)]
*  Negotiations on the bill continued through the night as a group of Republicans are pushing [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=53.08s)]
*  for even bigger spending cuts, with blue state Republicans seeking larger tax breaks [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=56.88s)]
*  by increasing the deduction on state and local taxes. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  Standing next to House Speaker Mike Johnson, President Trump spoke to the press on Tuesday [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=67.16s)]
*  during his visit to Capitol Hill. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=71.76s)]
*  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States of America. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=73.56s)]
*  This is the greatest bill that will ever—I think it's the most important bill this country [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=74.56s)]
*  just about has ever done in terms of size and scope. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  That's why we call it the great, big, beautiful deal. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it really is. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=86.48s)]
*  The bill is—I think it's going to be one of the most important. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=87.48s)]
*  It's the biggest tax reduction in history, biggest regulation reduction in history, incredible [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=91.48s)]
*  for Medicaid, for Medicare. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=97.96s)]
*  During a House hearing early this morning, Democratic Congressmember Brendan Boyle outlined [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=101.56s)]
*  how the bill could trigger more than a half a trillion dollars in Medicare cuts. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  This is really the breaking news, because when the Budget Committee kicked off this [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=112.2s)]
*  process approximately three months ago, there was a commitment by President Trump that there [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=116.84s)]
*  would be no Medicare cuts in this piece of legislation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=121.76s)]
*  And indeed, over the last several months, there has been no discussion of Medicare at [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  all. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=130.28s)]
*  There has been of Medicaid, but not of Medicare. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=131.28s)]
*  Well, here we are tonight because, as you explained, because of the size of the deficits, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=133.76s)]
*  because of the Pay-Go or Pay-As-You-Go Act, that would trigger sequestration of Medicare, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=140.64s)]
*  and it would total over $500 billion. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=147.6s)]
*  The official figure that CBO confirms is $535 billion in cuts to Medicare. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=150.88s)]
*  We're joined now by Bishop William Barber, president of Repairers at the Breach, founding [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  director of the Center for Public Theology and Public Policy at Yale Divinity School, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=163.76s)]
*  also national co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign and co-author of the book White Poverty. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=168.88s)]
*  How exposing myths about race and class can reconstruct American democracy. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=175.04s)]
*  Bishop Barber, you've twice been arrested recently on Capitol Hill during Moral Monday's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=180.08s)]
*  protests against the budget bill. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=185.2s)]
*  Talk about why. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much, Amy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  And I was talking to Joan Baez about this the other day, about how ugly the times are [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  here and how we must stand. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=193.96s)]
*  And we've got to sharpen our language. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=196.36s)]
*  I was arrested with others, and we were arrested in the rotunda for simply praying about the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=198.16s)]
*  ugliness of this bill. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=203.56s)]
*  And people who represent thousands, hundreds of thousands of religious congregants were [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=205.68s)]
*  arrested, and we're going back June 2nd for a mass Moral Monday sponsored by Repairers [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=210.68s)]
*  at the Breach and 20 other partners, because we have to stand up in this moment. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=216.84s)]
*  This is a big, ugly, destructive, deadly bill. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=220.44s)]
*  And we have to start talking about it in those terms. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=223.8s)]
*  It's not just about tax cuts to the wealthy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=227.04s)]
*  It is about that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=229.32s)]
*  But it is about death dealing and destruction to the poor and the elderly and the youth [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=230.32s)]
*  of our country, regardless of what their color is. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  In fact, one of the things we need to be doing is disaggregating what will happen in these [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  states and in various communities, whether you're in Appalachia or you're in Alabama. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=243.12s)]
*  They lie and say that this is about cutting fraud, and it really is not. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=248.28s)]
*  It is about cutting legitimate and life-giving and necessary programs that we fought for [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=252.68s)]
*  for years. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=258.16s)]
*  Real quickly, Amy, I want your listeners to understand when we talk about cutting Medicaid, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=259.16s)]
*  we're talking about primarily low income individuals of all races, creeds and colors, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=264.64s)]
*  families, children, pregnant women and elderly people and people with disabilities. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=269.6s)]
*  Now we're hearing 500 billion dollar cuts to Medicare. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=275.8s)]
*  We're talking about persons who are 65 years or older. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=279.76000000000005s)]
*  We're talking about children who have kidney disease, life-ending kidney disease, and people [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=283.04s)]
*  who have Lou Gehrig's disease. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  We know that for every a million people that have been denied health care, some 2,500 people, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=292.8s)]
*  some studies say, actually die. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=298.8s)]
*  We're talking about a time where we're already having 800 people dying a day from the effects [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=300.88000000000005s)]
*  of poverty and low wages. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=305.32000000000005s)]
*  This is a big, bad, ugly, deadly, destructive bill, and it must be resisted everywhere in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=307.24s)]
*  the places of power, in our pool pits, in the streets. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=313.88s)]
*  We must pray, put our bodies on the line, because what we're talking about here is 13.7 [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=318.44s)]
*  million people could lose Medicare and their health insurance. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  We also know that there's no way to do this kind of cutting without eventually also getting [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=329.52s)]
*  to Social Security. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=334.88s)]
*  The numbers just will not work. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=335.92s)]
*  We also know that Bannon has said in a video that he did that their goal is to control [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=337.96s)]
*  the five trillion dollar budget so they can control the 70-something trillion dollar assets [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=344.08s)]
*  owned by the government. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=349.52s)]
*  This is a massive takeover, a big, bad, ugly, destructive, deadly bill. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=350.88s)]
*  Talking about 11 million children who would lose food stamps, people lose food stamps, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=356.04s)]
*  four million of those are children. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=361.24s)]
*  We're talking about $6.5 billion investment in green energy being cut, being cut. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=363.64000000000004s)]
*  And they say that they are making these tax cuts to help society, but the very school [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=371.12s)]
*  that Trump often claims and brags about, he attended the Wharton School, has said that [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=376.08000000000004s)]
*  for low-income Americans, for poor and low-income people, the changes to the tax code in the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=381.12s)]
*  House bill means they will have less annual income. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=387.0s)]
*  They will lose an average of $1,035. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  But for the wealthiest people in this country, it says that they will get an average of $389,000 [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=393.36s)]
*  plus dollars more per year. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=402.36s)]
*  This is a big, bad, ugly, deadly, destructive bill that will hurt poor people, will hurt [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=405.12s)]
*  low-wage people, and ultimately will hurt America. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=412.0s)]
*  And if they do it, they want to do it for 10 years. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=416.08s)]
*  You're going to see massive destruction in rural health care. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  You're going to see these immoral cuts, where the rich have more, the poor and working people [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  have less. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=431.36s)]
*  And then they want to put more money, not only what they're cutting, but another $350 [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=432.36s)]
*  billion into defense contractors and more money into deportation. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=437.12s)]
*  So basically, what they want to do is take this budget and codify the vision and the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=443.48s)]
*  goals of Musk and DOG into this budget. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=448.8s)]
*  And they want to do it, Amy Lashley, with a reconciliation process that means they only [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=453.56s)]
*  need 51 votes, not 60, but 51 votes. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=459.44s)]
*  Trump is saying one thing that is true. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=463.36s)]
*  This is a great bill, but it's not great in the sense of good. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=466.44s)]
*  It is a great, big, bad, ugly, destructive, deadly, debilitating bill that will hurt [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=469.24s)]
*  Americans and poor, low-wage people for years and years to come, and could be the very [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=478.6s)]
*  undermining of our democracy if we allow it to go forward. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=483.32s)]
*  Bishop Barber, in rural areas specifically, there's been reports of many hospitals that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=487.84s)]
*  may be forced to close in rural communities as a result of cuts in federal funding. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=496.36s)]
*  Can you talk about, in your areas of North Carolina and other rural areas, the direct [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=502.96000000000004s)]
*  impact that will result from this? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=509.0s)]
*  Well, remember, COVID exposed a whole lot of our problem with our health system. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=512.4s)]
*  And so we know that the states, for instance, didn't expand Medicaid. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=517.24s)]
*  During COVID, many, many, many people died that didn't have to die. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=521.6s)]
*  And we saw the rate of death in poor and low-wage states, whether they were predominantly [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=525.48s)]
*  white or predominantly black, were about the same level. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=531.28s)]
*  It was gross. It was immoral. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=533.28s)]
*  It was bad. We also know that because states didn't accept Medicaid expansion, and this [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=535.24s)]
*  bill would roll back a lot of Medicaid expansion, would roll back Medicaid, which is [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=541.36s)]
*  critical to keeping rural hospitals open. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=545.8000000000001s)]
*  So let me give you a story of what we're going to see, what we've already seen. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=548.36s)]
*  In North Carolina, for instance, when North Carolina refused to expand Medicaid, there's [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=552.24s)]
*  a lady, a young lady, named Portia. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=558.12s)]
*  I met her. Portia was the first person to die in Bellhaven, North Carolina, a rural [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  community, after that hospital was closed because of the cuts in the denial of Medicaid [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=565.88s)]
*  expansion. They had a hospital that had it for 30, 40, 50 years. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=572.2s)]
*  It could not survive. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=576.44s)]
*  You know, she died in the parking lot, in the parking lot of a school waiting on the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=578.08s)]
*  helicopter to come. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=586.12s)]
*  And the doctor said if that hospital had been there, she would have probably lived [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=587.84s)]
*  because she would have been able to get to care within what we call the golden hour. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=593.32s)]
*  This bill goes forward. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=597.84s)]
*  You're going to hear more of that. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=599.84s)]
*  More hospitals cut, more rural hospitals cut, more inner city hospitals cut, more [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=601.24s)]
*  hospitals disabled from carrying out their duties to care for the people. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=607.64s)]
*  And I want to just drive home, Aiman and Juan, that we've got to get folk to see how [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=613.0s)]
*  this is affecting lives. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=618.96s)]
*  We have to start talking about this budget as a form of social and political murder, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=620.72s)]
*  social and political deadliness, because they know, and we're not used to the word [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=627.28s)]
*  murder, is because they know that it's going to cause death. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=631.84s)]
*  The studies are out there that tell what happened when you cut more and more health [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=636.04s)]
*  care. And yet they're pushing through and they're pushing through in the middle of [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=640.4s)]
*  the night. They do not want to have this debate during the day when people are up and [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  they can see what's going on. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=649.72s)]
*  They're doing it at night because this is a great, big, bad, ugly, deadly, destructive [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=651.24s)]
*  budget deal. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=656.36s)]
*  And yet, Bishop Barber, there are some Republicans that are holding out support because [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=658.32s)]
*  they want even more cuts than the present bill that is being shepherded by Speaker [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=663.6800000000001s)]
*  Johnson. What is your response to how people should resist or deal with the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=669.36s)]
*  maneuvers in Congress in these coming days? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=677.12s)]
*  This budget is a moral document. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=680.6s)]
*  That's why we're calling on people to join us June the 2nd on Monday for a mass Moral [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=682.84s)]
*  Monday right in front of the Supreme Court and in the Capitol. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=687.48s)]
*  Clergy are coming in full vestments. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=691.28s)]
*  We're inviting clergy. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=693.44s)]
*  Clergy are bringing impact to people and other advocates. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=694.72s)]
*  We have to stand up everywhere and declare that this is not about Democrat or Republican, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  as we said, the 2018 or left versus right. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=702.6800000000001s)]
*  This is really about right versus wrong. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  And this should be our total focus, because if you if you allow this with this budget, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=707.8800000000001s)]
*  you dismantle the government. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=713.32s)]
*  This is the attempt to so-called dismantle the state, the administrative state. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=714.72s)]
*  But it's deadly and it's destructive. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=719.5600000000001s)]
*  And we have to call it a moral issue. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=721.9200000000001s)]
*  And we have to put a face on who's actually going to be hurt and what's actually going to [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=723.9200000000001s)]
*  happen. I'm calling on every news agency to be putting up maps of the United States and [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=729.2s)]
*  show where the cuts are going to be so that folk can understand this is not going to affect [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=735.64s)]
*  people outside of your community. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=739.6800000000001s)]
*  It's going to affect your community. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=741.2800000000001s)]
*  Every Democratic congressperson or if there's a Republican that's against it should bring [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=743.0400000000001s)]
*  impact to people, to the gallery. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=749.08s)]
*  They should be walking through the congressional offices in the Capitol, make the folk [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=750.9599999999999s)]
*  have to see who they will actually be hurting, whose lives they will be putting on the [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=755.9599999999999s)]
*  line. This is gut check time for for for America. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=761.24s)]
*  This is gut check time for the moral voices of this country. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=765.28s)]
*  We cannot stand down in this moment. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=769.0799999999999s)]
*  If this goes into effect, we're talking about 10 years, 10 years, 10 years that this [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=772.3199999999999s)]
*  country could be hampered and hurt, hurt with what's going on, what will happen with this [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=778.36s)]
*  budget. And it's not just what they're cutting, it's what they're funding. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=783.44s)]
*  They're cutting the programs that bring life. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=787.32s)]
*  They're funding programs that bring more death and more deportation and more destruction. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=790.4s)]
*  Either way you look at it, this is a great, big, ugly, deadly, bad, destructive, disabling [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=796.48s)]
*  bill. And we have to stand against it in every way. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=802.64s)]
*  No one can be on the side, especially moral leaders, pastors and clergy, imams and rabbis [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=806.28s)]
*  who pastor and care for the people because we, particularly those in congregation [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=814.32s)]
*  leaders, will bury the people who have to be with the families whose lives will be cut [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=820.76s)]
*  short because of this great, big, ugly, deadly, destructive, disabilitating bill that [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=826.64s)]
*  they're trying to push through. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=832.88s)]
*  And lastly, I just don't know what's in the mind of people that you get up in the [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=834.36s)]
*  morning, what kind of mythology has gotten a hold of your mind that all you can figure out to [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=842.64s)]
*  do with power is how many people you can hurt, how many lives you can put at risk, how many [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=847.2s)]
*  lives you can destroy, how much bad policy. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=851.6s)]
*  It is a sickness. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=854.08s)]
*  And those of us who have not been bound by that sickness, it's time we have to stand up in [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=855.64s)]
*  this moment. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EFEiqtFXU&t=860.24s)]
