# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” September 4, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHVR7KFks30)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The Palestinian Ministry of Health says Israel's latest attacks on Gaza have killed 42 Palestinians
*  while wounding more than 100 others in the last 24 hours.
*  In central Gaza, nine people were killed as Israel bombed a residential building near
*  a city park.
*  Two children were among the dead.
*  Elsewhere, at least seven Palestinians were killed Tuesday when Israel bombed the Ma'a
*  northwest of Gaza City, where hundreds of displaced Palestinians had taken shelter.
*  Meanwhile, the World Health Organization says its mass vaccination campaign against polio
*  has so far reached about a quarter of Gaza's children, after Israel agreed to eight-hour
*  pauses in its attacks.
*  This is Ghada Judeh, a displaced Gaza resident and volunteer on the vaccination campaign.
*  We are displaced from Deir al-Bala.
*  I gave my children the polio vaccine to protect them from disease, but I can't protect them
*  from strikes and from death unless you help us, just as you helped us and delivered the
*  medications to us to protect our children.
*  So please, stand with us to stop the war so that our children can live peacefully and
*  to continue their studies.
*  Israeli forces have expanded their military offensive in the occupied West Bank, where
*  troops have raided the Jalazon refugee camp north of Ramallah.
*  Separately, Israeli forces surrounded Hebron for a fourth day, with more raids reported
*  around Kalkilia, Nablus and Bethlehem.
*  The Palestinian Authority reports Israeli assaults on the West Bank over the past week
*  have killed at least 33 Palestinians, including seven children.
*  Meanwhile, pressure is mounting for Israel to release Dr. Khaled Al-Sar, a highly respected
*  Palestinian surgeon who is abducted by Israeli forces during a raid on Gaza's Nasser Hospital
*  in March.
*  Colleagues say Dr. Al-Sar has been tortured in Israeli custody at Ofar Prison and at the
*  notorious Sedeh Tehman Prison Camp in the Negev Desert, where several Israeli soldiers
*  have been accused of raping Palestinian prisoners.
*  Dr. Al-Sar is the lead author of a journal article just published in the British medical
*  journal The Lancet.
*  Democracy Now! spoke to one of the paper's co-authors, Dr. Simon Fitzgerald, a Brooklyn
*  trauma surgeon.
*  Our lead author, Dr. Khaled Al-Sar, remains forcibly disappeared.
*  And it was only about probably the same week that the piece was published that we got word
*  through Israeli physicians for human rights who were able to get a lawyer into Ofar Prison,
*  where Dr. Khaled Al-Sar is, at least at the time he was interviewed in July, was being
*  held and were able to get testimony that he indeed was abducted by Israeli forces, abused,
*  maltreated, basically tortured.
*  Human Rights Watch reports doctors, nurses and paramedics held by Israel have faced widespread
*  torture, including beatings, rape and sexual abuse, forced stress positions, prolonged
*  cuffing, blindfolding and denial of medical care.
*  To see our segment on that report, go to democracynow.org.
*  Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of major cities across Israel for
*  the fourth day in a row to demand Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agree to a ceasefire and
*  hostage deal.
*  This morning, families of hostages held by Hamas held a protest outside Likud Party headquarters
*  in Tel Aviv.
*  That follows Tuesday evening protests outside the Israeli army headquarters.
*  We'll have the latest on Israel and Palestine.
*  We'll speak with Israeli negotiator Gershon Baskin.
*  In Ukraine, a pair of Russian missiles struck a military academy and hospital in the city
*  of Paltava on Tuesday, killing at least 51 people and injuring more than 270 others.
*  It was among the deadliest attacks on Ukraine since Russia's invasion in early 2022.
*  In a separate assault, a 38-year-old mother was killed with her 8-year-old son in a Russian
*  strike on a hotel in Ukraine's Upper Riga region.
*  Survivors say the assault came almost without warning.
*  There was an explosion two minutes after the air alert was declared.
*  We had no time to hide.
*  There was a very powerful explosion.
*  We heard people screaming.
*  We understood that there was a collapse at the hotel.
*  Overnight, Poland's military set its scrambled Polish and allied fighter planes to its border
*  with Ukraine after Russia launched drone and missile attacks on the western Ukrainian city
*  of Lviv.
*  Those attacks killed seven people, including three children.
*  Meanwhile, several of Ukraine's top government ministers have tendered their resignation
*  as part of President Volodymyr Zelensky's biggest shakeup of his administration to date.
*  Among the high-profile resignations are Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba and weapons chief Alexander
*  Khmyshin.
*  In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at least 129 people were killed on Monday as
*  they tried to escape the notorious Makala prison in Kinshasa.
*  Dozens more were injured.
*  The DRC's security minister says two dozen prisoners were shot dead by guards.
*  The rest reportedly died in a crowd crush set off by the chaos.
*  The prison was built to house 1,500 people.
*  At its peak this summer, it held 15,000.
*  Amnesty International's described conditions at Makala prison as appalling, while prisoners
*  report widespread hunger, overcrowding and abuse.
*  I have been detained here for a year without trial.
*  The conditions are difficult.
*  The prisoners die every day.
*  The people suffer here like you have no idea.
*  The prisoners eat very badly.
*  And the rations of the prisoners are often diverted by the prison officials.
*  In Nigeria, at least 81 people were killed Sunday when fighters from the Boko Haram militant
*  group opened fire on villagers in the northeastern state of Yobbe.
*  Many survivors said the massacre was retaliation for the community's refusal to pay extortion
*  money to Boko Haram fighters.
*  Fifteen years of insurgency by Boko Haram has killed tens of thousands of Nigerians
*  while displacing more than two million people.
*  At least 12 migrants, including a pregnant woman and several children, have died after
*  their boat capsized as they attempted to cross the English Channel.
*  Some 65 survivors were rescued Tuesday.
*  Most of the migrants on the boat are from Eritrea.
*  The English Channel has become a common route for thousands of migrants attempting to reach
*  the U.K. for safety.
*  Here in the United States, the summer heat wave is bringing some of the year's hottest
*  temperatures to southwestern states.
*  Excessive heat warnings are in effect in southern California, where the National Weather Service
*  is forecasting several days of triple-digit heat, with highs of up to 120 degrees Fahrenheit
*  in some areas.
*  Meanwhile, Phoenix, Arizona, Tuesday shattered its previous record after logging its 100th
*  consecutive day of temperatures reaching 100 degrees or more, with no end to scorching
*  temperatures in sight.
*  Donald Trump entered a not-guilty plea Tuesday after Special Counsel Jack Smith filed a revised
*  criminal indictment against Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential
*  election.
*  Trump also waived the right to be present at his arraignment.
*  Elsewhere, a federal judge in Manhattan has denied a request by Donald Trump to transfer
*  his New York state criminal case to federal courts after rejecting Trump's claims that
*  Judge Juan Marchand was biased against him.
*  In May, Trump was found guilty of all 34 felony charges of attempting to influence the 2016
*  presidential election by falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments.
*  He's still scheduled to be sentenced on September 18.
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump's campaign has been ordered to stop using the music of the late
*  singer Isaac Hayes at Trump rallies.
*  A judge in Georgia agreed with a lawsuit brought by Hayes' family, who says the legendary
*  singer would not have approved of Trump's use of his song, Hold On, I'm Coming.
*  Montana Republican U.S. Senate candidate Tim Sheehy has been caught on tape making racist
*  comments about Native Americans.
*  Sheehy's remarks were first reported by the Charcouste News, the official publication
*  of the Flathead Indian Reservation, which obtained audio clips of Sheehy at campaign
*  events last November.
*  In more racist comments, Sheehy joked that members of the Crow tribe would, quote,
*  "'let you know whether they like you or not.
*  There's Coors Light cans flying by your head,' unquote.
*  Montana's home to eight federally recognized tribes with more than 70,000 Native Americans
*  of voting age.
*  Political action committees have spent more than $44 million on Montana's Senate race,
*  where Republicans hope to unseat Democratic Senator John Tester in November.
*  Here in New York, federal prosecutors have indicted a former aide to governors Kathy
*  Hokel and Andrew Cuomo on charges she acted as an agent for the Chinese government.
*  The U.S. Attorney's Office alleges Linda Sun, former deputy chief of staff to Governor
*  undisclosed agent of the Chinese government while her husband helped launder millions
*  of dollars in kickbacks for personal gain.
*  The 10-count criminal indictment also alleges Sun thwarted efforts by Taiwanese officials
*  to speak to New York's governor and eliminated references to Taiwan and China's persecution
*  of Uyghur Muslims from state communications.
*  Hokel's office says the governor fired Sun in March of last year after discovering evidence
*  of misconduct.
*  And in Florida, the federal trial against three members of a pan-Africanist group accused
*  of conspiring with the Russian government to sow discord and interfere in U.S. elections
*  began in Tampa this week.
*  Omali Yeshitela, longtime chair of the African People's Socialist Party, also known as
*  the International People's Democratic Uhuru Movement, along with Penny Hess and Jesse
*  Neville were indicted last year for allegedly working on behalf of Russia in a multiyear
*  foreign malign influence campaign in the United States.
*  Another U.S. citizen and three Russian nationals are also part of the case.
*  As the trial got underway Tuesday, Democracy Now spoke to Umwezi Ulldum, chair of Hands
*  Off Uhuru.
*  Umwezi Ulldum, Chair, Hands Off Uhuru.
*  The government, as we say, has nothing.
*  And everything that they are accusing the Uhuru three of is pure political speech.
*  And you know, this is again just an attempt to rewrite history, you know, that includes,
*  decades of organizing and struggling for, you know, democratic rights in this country,
*  such as the right to vote, the right to freedom of speech, the right to freedom of the press,
*  freedom of association, freedom of assembly, you know, everything.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now, democracynow.org, War, Peace and the Presidency.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
