We look at the Trump administration's escalating attacks on press freedom, and how the media has responded with bended knee in some cases, with Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. The Trump administration has threatened journalists and media outlets for their coverage, and the Federal Communications Commission is investigating PBS and NPR over its funding sources. Meanwhile, a number of major news organizations face accusations of surrendering to Trump's threats. In December, ABC settled a defamation suit brought by Trump by making a $15 million donation to his future presidential library. CBS's parent company Paramount is reportedly in talks to settle a multibillion-dollar lawsuit filed by Trump, who accused _60 Minutes_ of deceptively editing an interview with Kamala Harris. Trump initially sought $10 billion in the lawsuit and is now seeking $20 billion. "What I see here is media organizations that have the power to fight back against Trump but aren't doing it. I think that's a failure of courage," says Jaffer. "Every time one of those media organizations settles a case, the next organization finds it more difficult to resist Trump."

*  Last week, CBS took the unusual step of handing over its unedited tapes to the FCC. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=107.44s)]
*  While the tape showed no wrongdoing on CBS's part, many believe Paramount might still settle [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=113.44s)]

*  at Columbia University, as recent New York Times opinion piece has headlined, This is [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=132.44s)]
*  Not a Moment to Settle with Trump. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=137.56s)]
*  Welcome back to Democracy Now!, Jamil. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=140.0s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=141.6s)]
*  So, we just went through some of the cases, but if you can go through them in depth and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=142.76s)]
*  explain what is happening here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=148.04s)]
*  Is the media obeying in advance? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=150.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's how I see it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=153.12s)]
*  I see a kind of failure of courage among the largest and most powerful media organizations [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=155.56s)]
*  in the country. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=163.48s)]
*  You know, you started with the ABC settlement. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=164.48s)]
*  This is a case that arose out of George Stephanopoulos saying on TV that President Trump had been [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=169.08s)]
*  found liable for rape when, in fact, the jury had found him liable for sexual assault. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=175.0s)]
*  Trump sued, claiming that he'd been defamed. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=180.72000000000003s)]
*  I don't think that there— [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=183.36s)]
*  And let's be clear. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=184.8s)]
*  It was the judge who said in common parlance this would be rape. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=190.52s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=191.52s)]
*  I don't think that Trump had any chance of winning that lawsuit. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=192.52s)]
*  If ABC had contested it, ABC would have been protected by the New York Times v. Sullivan [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=196.72s)]
*  rule. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=202.04s)]
*  New York Times v. Sullivan is a 60-year-old case that gives citizens broad power to—or [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=203.04s)]
*  broad latitude to criticize government officials. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=209.52s)]
*  Makes it very difficult for public officials to recover in defamation actions. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=211.8s)]
*  I don't think there's any way that ABC would have lost that case, but they settled the case. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=216.2s)]
*  Second one is Metta's settlement with Trump. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=222.52s)]
*  This is over Metta's decision, or Facebook and Instagram's decision, to deplatform Trump [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=224.56s)]
*  after January 6th. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=230.16s)]
*  Trump sued, claiming that his First Amendment rights had been violated. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=232.2s)]
*  This I think is a totally frivolous case. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=235.44s)]
*  There's no way that Trump would have won that case against Metta, but Metta settled it as [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=237.24s)]
*  well for $25 million. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=241.4s)]
*  Again, all going to Trump's presidential library. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=243.2s)]
*  And then finally, this reported CBS settlement, or possible CBS settlement, with Trump over [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=247.96s)]
*  the action, over the case that involved the editing of this Kamala Harris interview. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=256.64s)]
*  I don't think that CBS edited that interview in any unusual way at all. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  The kind of editing they did is routine for journalism, for media organizations. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=269.06s)]
*  Trump knows that. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=275.08s)]
*  Again, no chance that Trump would have won that case, but CBS is reportedly thinking [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=276.84s)]
*  about settling it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  What I see here is media organizations that have the power to fight back against Trump, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=284.36s)]
*  but aren't doing it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=290.2s)]
*  I think that's a failure of courage, and it has implications for those particular media [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=291.76s)]
*  organizations, because I think it affects their credibility and their prestige. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=299.12s)]
*  But it has larger press freedom implications as well, because every time one of those media [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=304.12s)]
*  organizations settles a case, the next organization finds it more difficult to resist Trump. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=307.96s)]
*  And this is a moment in which we need these organizations to hold the powerful to account, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=314.64s)]
*  hold Trump to account, and this is exactly what they should not be doing. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  And, Jamil, what about this latest story this week about the FCC investigating a San Francisco [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=324.84s)]
*  radio station, KCBS, for its coverage of immigration enforcement in San Jose? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=332.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, here, too, I think you see the Trump administration trying to use its regulatory [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=338.72s)]
*  authorities in a way that chills press freedom, chills legitimate reporting. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=345.08s)]
*  No question here that that radio station was within its rights to report what it did. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=350.88s)]
*  And what Trump is trying to do, or what the FCC is trying to do here, is chill not just [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=357.68s)]
*  that radio station, but other radio stations and other media organizations from engaging [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=363.0s)]
*  in reporting that is inconvenient to the administration. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=367.24s)]
*  I mean, I mentioned the CBS case. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=369.56s)]
*  Another aspect of that case involves the FCC, with the FCC having demanded from CBS that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=372.88s)]
*  it turn over unedited transcripts of its interview with Kamala Harris. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=379.96s)]
*  And I don't think in another... [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=387.96s)]
*  And they released them. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=389.6s)]
*  And they released them. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=390.6s)]
*  And they released them. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=391.6s)]
*  I don't think in another, in any other era, a news organization would have just turned [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=392.6s)]
*  over those transcripts without at least trying to get a judge to narrow the request or look [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=399.76s)]
*  at the transcripts in camera before turning them over. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=407.44s)]
*  But CBS just turned them over. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=411.48s)]
*  And I think that there's a real risk here that on paper we're going to have all the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=414.88s)]
*  First Amendment rights in the world. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=421.08s)]
*  The First Amendment is going to look great on paper. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=422.4s)]
*  But the organizations that we need to assert their First Amendment rights to defend press [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=425.88s)]
*  freedom are increasingly just not doing it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=430.96s)]
*  I mean, I've named a few of the settlements, but even before we got to the settlements, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=434.91999999999996s)]
*  there were the LA Times and the Washington Post, which quashed editorials that would [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=438.08s)]
*  have been... that would have provoked Trump. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=444.08s)]
*  This happened before the election. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=447.0s)]
*  Then there were the big tech companies that all made million-dollar donations to Trump's [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  inaugural fund. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=453.52s)]
*  I think what we're seeing is media organizations, including social media organizations, lining [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=456.2s)]
*  up to ingratiate themselves with President Trump. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=460.96s)]
*  And that is an extremely troubling thing at this particular moment. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=464.24s)]
*  And of course, it's not just media organizations. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=468.56s)]
*  At universities, talk about the free speech rights that are endangered, increasingly endangered [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=471.32s)]
*  at universities by the Trump administration, for instance, threatening to deport pro-Palestinian [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=478.88s)]
*  students. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=485.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I think this is... [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  It's a larger issue across society. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=489.40000000000003s)]
*  Many of the institutions that we need to serve as checks on government power at a moment [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=491.94s)]
*  like this are not doing their jobs. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=499.90000000000003s)]
*  Now, this question about, you know, in what circumstances can the government deport non-citizens [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=502.74s)]
*  for exercising their First Amendment rights, I think is a hugely significant question. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=510.58s)]
*  And I want people to understand that the First Amendment protects non-citizen students at [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=515.74s)]
*  American universities just like it protects everybody else. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=521.26s)]
*  The government cannot constitutionally deport people simply because they have exercised [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=525.14s)]
*  their First Amendment rights, simply because they have criticized a war overseas or criticized [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=531.7s)]
*  our government or criticized another government. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=538.02s)]
*  Those are not constitutionally permissible justifications for deporting somebody. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=540.58s)]
*  So, you know, and you don't have to take my word for it because a couple of years ago, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=549.1s)]
*  the Knight Institute, my institute filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=554.3000000000001s)]
*  Biden administration, and we were able to get two memos, two legal memos, in which the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=560.0600000000001s)]
*  Trump administration had considered its authority to engage in these kinds of deportations based [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=565.78s)]
*  on First Amendment activity. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=571.5400000000001s)]
*  Trump administration lawyers wrote memos that acknowledge that non-citizens at universities [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=572.82s)]
*  in the United States are protected by the First Amendment and that deporting them on [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=580.46s)]
*  the basis of their speech would almost certainly be unconstitutional. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=583.86s)]
*  And then, Jamil Jaffer, talk about what happened Friday night with the casino magnate Steve [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=587.4200000000001s)]
*  Wynn asking the Supreme Court to revisit the Times v. Sullivan defamation rule, the Supreme [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=591.6600000000001s)]
*  Court decision, one of the two most important press freedom cases. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=598.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So I mentioned New York Times v. Sullivan already. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=602.74s)]
*  This is a, you know, has been a campaign by some conservatives over the last few years [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=605.58s)]
*  to try to get the Supreme Court to narrow or overrule New York Times v. Sullivan, which [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=611.26s)]
*  should be a very big deal because it's New York Times v. Sullivan more than any other [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=616.42s)]
*  case that protects our ability to criticize government officials, which is core to our [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=620.1s)]
*  democracy. And this- [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=625.78s)]
*  And what was it established under New York Times v. Sullivan? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=626.78s)]
*  What case was that? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=629.34s)]
*  So it's called New York Times v. Sullivan. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=630.42s)]
*  It's a case involving the New York Times was sued by a Southern police official who [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=632.22s)]
*  was concerned about civil rights activism in the South and complained in particular [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=639.14s)]
*  about an ad in the New York Times that he said he said accurately was inaccurate. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=647.22s)]
*  The ad included some inaccuracies in it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=651.62s)]
*  And he said because the ad included inaccuracies, the New York Times was liable, I think was [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=654.34s)]
*  for $500,000, which at the time would have been crushing liability even for the New York [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=658.22s)]
*  Times. And if he had won that case, other news organizations reporting on the civil [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=663.14s)]
*  rights movement would have been crushed as well. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=668.5s)]
*  But the Supreme Court said if you're criticizing government officials, you have to have [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=670.22s)]
*  broad latitude even to get things wrong. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=675.34s)]
*  So unless the public official can show what's called actual malice, so unless the public [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=677.58s)]
*  official can show that the newspaper or the writer recklessly published false information [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=683.1s)]
*  or deliberately published false information, there's no recovery possible. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=691.5s)]
*  The First Amendment forecloses recovery. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=695.98s)]
*  So now some conservatives are pushing to get the Supreme Court to overrule that decision. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=698.14s)]
*  I think it's a misguided campaign. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=703.26s)]
*  Even if you want the things that these conservatives want, I think it's going to backfire on [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=705.1s)]
*  them. But this cert petition that was filed on Friday night, this request that the Supreme [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=710.1s)]
*  Court hear the case is another effort in this longer campaign to get the Supreme Court to [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=715.3000000000001s)]
*  either scale back or overrule New York Times versus Sullivan. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=721.86s)]
*  Jamil Jaffer, thanks so much for being with us, director of the Night First Amendment [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=725.1800000000001s)]
*  Institute at Columbia University. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=728.58s)]
*  We'll link to your piece in the New York Times. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=730.14s)]
*  This is not a moment to settle with Trump. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1GMMTd5lA&t=732.1s)]
