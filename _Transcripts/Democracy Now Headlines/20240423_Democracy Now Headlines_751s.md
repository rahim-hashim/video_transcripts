# Top U.S. & World Headlines — April 23, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESNWUPnhicE)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Civil defense workers in Gaza have now recovered at least 310 bodies buried in a mass grave
*  at the Nasser Medical Complex in the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis.
*  Earlier today, U.N. human rights chief Volker Turk said he was horrified by the mass grave,
*  which was found two weeks after Israeli forces ended their siege on the hospital.
*  Some of the bodies found had their hands tied behind their backs.
*  Today marks 200 days since Israel launched its assault on Gaza.
*  On Monday, the U.N. special rapporteur on the right to health, Klaaling Mofo-Keng, warned
*  the impact of the Israeli war will be felt for generations.
*  Mental health, intergenerational trauma, the kinds of acute assistance, medical debriefing,
*  psychological debriefing that many children still have not received is of serious concern.
*  And often, of course, we see the physical injury, and because it's physical, one can
*  appreciate the severity of it.
*  But the acute mental distress that will then turn into anxiety and other kinds of mental
*  illnesses later on in life is really, really important to start thinking intentionally
*  about.
*  An independent U.N. commission says Israel has offered no evidence to back up its allegations
*  that employees of the U.N. aid agency UNRWA participated in the October 7th attacks by
*  Hamas.
*  Allegations by Israel led many countries to temporarily cut off funding just as the humanitarian
*  crisis was intensifying in Gaza.
*  U.S. lawmakers have banned UNRWA funding for the next year.
*  Palestinian solidarity protests and encampments are spreading across college campuses around
*  the country, inspired by the Gaza Solidarity Encampment at Columbia University.
*  Here in New York, police raided a student encampment at New York University Monday night.
*  Police arrested more than 150 people, including students and faculty.
*  Earlier on Monday, police at Yale University arrested 60 protesters, including 47 students
*  who'd set up a campus encampment to demand the school divest from weapons manufacturers.
*  At Columbia University, the student encampment has entered its seventh day.
*  On Monday night, about 100 student protesters and faculty took part in a Gaza liberation
*  seder to mark the start of the Jewish holiday of Passover.
*  Encampments are now in place at numerous other schools, including the University of Michigan
*  Ann Arbor, the University of California Berkeley, the University of Maryland, MIT and Emerson
*  College in Boston.
*  Yasser Munith is an Emerson professor.
*  YASSER MUNITH, Emerson College Professor I want Emerson to listen to the students,
*  hear them, understand their perspective, also open a space for a discussion of Palestine,
*  the discussion of the genocide in Palestine, in Gaza, and allow the student to express
*  themselves, freedom of speech, academic freedom.
*  In more protest news, PEN America's canceled its awards ceremony after roughly half of
*  this year's nominees withdrew from literary prizes to protest what they called PEN's
*  complicity in normalizing genocide, unquote.
*  The estate of Jean Stein, which awards a $75,000 prize each year, requested the money be directed
*  instead to the Palestine Children's Relief Fund.
*  Her children are Katrina and Wendy van den Hovel.
*  Google has fired another 20 workers in retaliation for last week's protest against Project
*  Nimbus, Google's cloud computing contract with Israel.
*  The firings reportedly included workers who were simply bystanders during the sit-in.
*  In a Manhattan courtroom, both the prosecution and defense delivered opening statements Monday
*  in Donald Trump's criminal hush money case, the first of four criminal cases Trump is
*  facing.
*  Prosecutors said Trump's $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniel in 2016
*  in his effort to cover it up by falsifying business records constituted, quote, election
*  fraud pure and simple, unquote.
*  Meanwhile, Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanch, argued the former president did not do anything
*  illegal saying, quote, there's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election, unquote.
*  The court heard briefly from the prosecution's first witness, David Pecker, former publisher
*  of the National Enquirer.
*  He's taking the stand again today.
*  The court will also consider arguments from prosecutors that Trump has repeatedly violated
*  his gag order.
*  Meanwhile, Trump's valet, Walt Nauta, a co-defendant in Trump's classified documents
*  case, was reportedly told he would be pardoned if he lied to the FBI and Trump was re-elected
*  as president.
*  The conservative-ruled U.S. Supreme Court appeared to side with an Oregon city's crackdown
*  on unhoused people in a key case that could have devastating implications nationwide.
*  The case centers around the small city of Grants Pass, Oregon, which has banned people
*  from sleeping with a blanket or pillow on any public land despite not having public
*  shelters.
*  Those who violate the ban can face hundreds of dollars in fines.
*  Liberal Justice Elena Kagan highlighted the absurdity of the city's ban.
*  … regulation is a biological necessity.
*  It's sort of like breathing.
*  I mean, you could say breathing is conduct, too.
*  But presumably, you would not think that it's OK to criminalize breathing in public.
*  Fellow liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor also challenged the Grants Pass attorney, arguing
*  the city does not arrest babies or stargazers who bring blankets to public parks.
*  Where do we put them if every city, every village, every town lacks compassion and passes
*  a law identical to this?
*  Where are they supposed to sleep?
*  Are they supposed to kill themselves not sleeping?
*  Outside the Supreme Court, hundreds of housing justice advocates gathered to demonstrate.
*  Among those addressing the crowd was Bishop William Barber of the Poor People's Campaign.
*  Laws that make it a crime to be poor are unjust.
*  Laws that would paralyze homeless folk for sleep sleeping in public parks is unjust,
*  excessive and cruel and unusual a punishment, and it has no place in America.
*  The United Kingdom's highly contested plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda is set
*  to become law after it was passed by the House of Lords Monday.
*  Despite ongoing questions over its lawfulness, Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak vowed
*  to begin the deportation flights in 10 to 12 weeks.
*  But we are ready.
*  Plans are in place.
*  And these flights will go come what may.
*  No foreign court will stop us from getting flights off.
*  The plan was agreed to by Rwanda and the UK two years ago, but has faced intense criticism
*  from rights groups.
*  Monday's bill overrides a UK Supreme Court ruling from last year, which found the policy
*  unconstitutional.
*  UN human rights experts have asked the UK to reconsider the plan and warned aviation
*  authorities against participating in the deportation flights, citing a possible violation of international
*  human rights laws.
*  In related news, just hours ago, local authorities say at least five people, including a seven-year-old
*  girl, died as they attempted to cross the English Channel from France in an overcrowded
*  boat.
*  Rescue operations are still underway.
*  In Mexico, two mayoral candidates were killed Friday, Noe Ramos Ferreres in Tamaulipas State
*  and Alberto Garcia in Oaxaca.
*  Seventeen candidates have been murdered in the run-up to the June 2nd election in Mexico,
*  where drug cartels often target mayors as they seek to control local police department
*  and municipal authorities.
*  The Biden administration Monday issued a new rule protecting the privacy of patients seeking
*  reproductive healthcare.
*  The rule, which bars the disclosure of patients' medical records, applies even when someone
*  travels out of state for an abortion or IVF or other reproductive healthcare.
*  President Biden announced a $7 billion investment in Solar Energy Monday, which was Earth Day.
*  The money, which comes from the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, will fund dozens
*  of solar projects around the country and create an estimated 200,000 jobs.
*  Biden made the announcement in Virginia's Prince William Forest Park, flanked by Senators
*  Bernie Sanders and Ed Markey and Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
*  I will put tens of thousands of young people to work at the forefront of our climate resilience
*  and energy future, clean energy future.
*  Today I'm proud to announce that Americans across the country can now apply, now apply,
*  to become the first members of the American Climate Corps.
*  We're recruiting for over 2,000 positions in 36 states, to start with, in Washington,
*  D.C., Puerto Rico, with many on the way.
*  Environmental activists from around the world are gathered in New York this week, where
*  they held a first-of-its-kind Earth Day hearing on Citigroup's environmental racism Monday.
*  Citibank is the world's second-largest funder of coal, oil and gas.
*  Rashada Azzan is a black environmental leader from Sulphur, Louisiana, who's been leading
*  the fight against the Citibank-funded LNG buildout in her community.
*  We are calling for Citibank to commit to end funding and financing services for new and
*  expanding liquefied methane gas projects and their parent companies, including all projects
*  that have already been built and those that have not been built or those that have not
*  reached a final investment decision.
*  This is a critical time for a city to assess climate, community and human rights impacts
*  of the methane gas sector.
*  Students from Columbia, Tulane and the University of Virginia filed complaints with their state's
*  attorneys general, arguing their university's fossil fuel investments are illegal and counter
*  to their missions.
*  The students cite a law which requires nonprofit institutions to prioritize charitable purposes
*  when they invest.
*  They also highlight the hypocrisy of the colleges conducting climate research while hoping to
*  financially fuel the crisis.
*  And in South Korea, a court heard from youth climate activists and their families who accused
*  the government of failing to meaningfully act on climate change.
*  It's believed to be the first such case in Asia.
*  Similar cases have been filed in Europe and the U.S.
*  This is the mother of two children plaintiff.
*  Carbon emission reduction keeps getting pushed back as if it is a homework that can be done
*  later.
*  But that burden will be what our children have to bear eventually.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
