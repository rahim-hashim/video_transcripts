# Top U.S. & World Headlines — September 11, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQsUOIMdiaY)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump took to the stage in Philadelphia
*  Tuesday evening for their first and only scheduled presidential debate.
*  The event was hosted by ABC News and did not include any third-party candidates.
*  Harris repeatedly put Trump on the defensive as they debated abortion, immigration, Israel's
*  war on Gaza, race, January 6 and other issues.
*  Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression.
*  Donald Trump left us the worst public health epidemic in a century.
*  Donald Trump left us the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.
*  And what we have done is clean up Donald Trump's mess.
*  Donald Trump repeated his false claim that he won the 2020 election.
*  He also doubled down on a baseless racist lie that Haitian immigrants were stealing
*  and eating people's pets in the city of Springfield, Ohio.
*  In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in.
*  They're eating the cats.
*  They're eating—they're eating the pets of the people that live there.
*  Trump's remarks came even after Springfield's town manager confirmed there had been no credible
*  reports that pets or other animals had been harmed by immigrants.
*  Following the debate, the legendary pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Harris, calling her
*  a steady-handed, gifted leader.
*  She signed her endorsement in an Instagram post as Childless Cat Lady, referring to comments
*  by Trump's running mate J.D. Vance.
*  Her headlines will air clips of the debate and hold a roundtable discussion.
*  In the Gaza Strip, Israeli attacks have killed more than two dozen Palestinians over the
*  past 24 hours.
*  Among the dead are 13 members of a single family across three generations who were killed
*  when Israel bombed their home in Chanyunas.
*  On Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres joined a chorus of international
*  condemnation over Israel's attack on a tent encampment of displaced Palestinians
*  in Al Mawasi, which Israel had designated as a so-called safe zone.
*  The assault killed at least 40 people and injured more than 60 others.
*  Survivors said the blast buried entire families under the sand and littered the camp with
*  body parts.
*  Children became orphans.
*  We became homeless.
*  Where should we go?
*  They said go to Al Mawasi.
*  We went to Al Mawasi.
*  They hit us after we were displaced many times.
*  Where are we supposed to go?
*  An Al Jazeera investigation found the massacre was carried out by U.S.-made MK-84 bombs produced
*  by General Dynamics.
*  Israel has stepped up its attacks on southern Lebanon with reports of at least 20 Israeli
*  airstrikes overnight that damaged farms and property and sparked intense wildfires.
*  Israel's military claims one of the strikes killed a Hezbollah commander in the Bekaa
*  Valley.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Israel's military put the city of Tubas under siege as it carried
*  out an airstrike that killed five Palestinians.
*  Two of the dead were teenagers.
*  Israeli forces also killed two Palestinians during another raid on the city of Tulkarim.
*  The Palestinian Ministry of Health reports Israeli attacks have killed nearly 700 people
*  across the West Bank over the past year.
*  Meanwhile, the family of the Turkish-American activist Aysenur Ezgi Aghi says the White
*  House has not called to offer condolences after Aghi was fatally shot in the head by
*  an Israeli sniper at a protest in the West Bank town of Bekaa last Friday.
*  On Tuesday, President Biden said he believed Aghi was killed by accident at the bullet
*  that struck her ricocheted off the ground.
*  The Israeli military said in a statement it was highly likely Aghi was shot by its
*  forces indirectly and unintentionally in fire that was not aimed at Aghi, but another
*  protester.
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken, meanwhile, criticized Israel's military for Aghi's
*  death.
*  — Her killing was both unprovoked and unjustified.
*  No one, no one should be shot and killed for attending a protest.
*  No one should have to put their life at risk just for freely expressing their views.
*  In our judgment, Israeli security forces need to make some fundamental changes in the way
*  that they operate in the West Bank, including changes to their rules of engagement.
*  — Despite those remarks, the Biden administration has yet to put any conditions on U.S. arms
*  transfers to Israel, including a $20 billion in additional weapons sales approved last
*  month.
*  Canada's top diplomat says her government has suspended about 30 permits for arms shipments
*  to Israel.
*  Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Jolie said Tuesday she had also canceled a contract with
*  the U.S.-based weapons manufacturer General Dynamics to sell 50,000 Canadian-produced
*  mortar rounds to the Israeli military.
*  — Our policy is clear.
*  We will not have any form of arms or parts of arms be sent to Gaza, period.
*  How they're being sent and where they're being sent is irrelevant.
*  — In a statement, Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East called on Jolie to
*  cancel all permits and to proactively block the transfer of any weapons from reaching Israel.
*  The group added, quote,
*  It's concerning that when Jolie says that weapons cannot be used in Gaza, she's intentionally
*  excluding the West Bank, where Israel's been killing one Palestinian child every two days.
*  We should accept no more weapons to Israel, period, they said.
*  In Philadelphia, several people were arrested Tuesday evening as hundreds of protesters
*  gathered outside the venue of the presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump
*  to demand an end to U.S. support for Israel's war on Gaza.
*  — I'm definitely not going to be voting for Trump or Harris.
*  They're both war criminals.
*  And Kamala wants to act like she's one of the people, and she is not.
*  She is part of the same administration sending bombs to Gaza.
*  — Ahead of Tuesday's debate, Minnesota governor and Democratic vice presidential
*  nominee Tim Wolles was heckled by pro-Palestine protesters during a campaign event in Phoenix,
*  Arizona.
*  Meanwhile, in Australia, hundreds of protesters rallied outside a weapons industry convention
*  in Melbourne earlier today.
*  Police fired stun grenades, rubber bullets and pepper spray, arresting dozens of demonstrators.
*  Hundreds of weapons traders representing at least 30 countries are expected to attend
*  the Land Force's 2024 Military Weapons Expo this week.
*  Hundreds of protesters stormed Mexico's Senate Tuesday, disrupting debate on a highly
*  contested judiciary overhaul measure.
*  This came just hours after the Moreno ruling party garnered enough votes to pass the proposed
*  court reform, which would see judges, including those on the Mexican Supreme Court, be elected
*  by the people.
*  The move has been championed by outgoing Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who
*  says the reform would crack down on corruption across courts.
*  Critics argue the plan could threaten judicial independence.
*  Missouri's Supreme Court has allowed a ballot measure enshrining abortion rights in the
*  state's constitution to remain on November's ballot.
*  Tuesday's ruling came just before the deadline to print ballots for mail-in voters.
*  If approved by voters, the measure could undo Missouri's near-total abortion ban, which
*  went into effect after the Supreme Court's ruling that gutted Roe v. Wade in 2022.
*  At least eight other states, including Arizona and Florida, will vote on similar measures
*  in November, after headlines will have more on reproductive rights, a major topic in last
*  night's presidential debate.
*  In Vietnam, the death toll from typhoon Yagi has risen to 155.
*  On Wednesday, a flash flood swept away an entire small village, killing at least 30
*  people.
*  Dozens more remain missing.
*  Here in the United States, Louisiana and Mississippi have declared states of emergency
*  as Hurricane Francine approaches the Gulf Coast, bringing potentially life-threatening
*  storm surges.
*  The hurricane has prompted oil and gas companies to shut down operations in the Gulf of Mexico.
*  And a new report by Global Witness finds nearly 200 environmental defenders were killed around
*  the globe last year.
*  Colombia, once again, topped the list as the deadliest nation for environmentalists and
*  activists, with at least 79 people killed, most of them indigenous Afro-Colombians and
*  farmers.
*  The second most deadly country was Brazil.
*  Here in the U.S., the report condemned the police killing of environmental activist
*  Manuel Esteban Terán, known as Tortuguita, during a raid on a stop-cop city encampment
*  in Atlanta, Georgia.
*  Tortuguita was 26 years old.
*  They were struck 57 times by police bullets while peacefully protesting the multimillion
*  dollar police training complex.
*  No officers have been charged in Tortuguita's killing.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
