Israel continues to detain eight individuals who were captured Monday when Israeli Navy commandos intercepted a Gaza-bound boat carrying humanitarian aid. Four other passengers on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla have been deported, including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. We get an update from Sergio Toribio, one of the 12 on board the _Madleen_, who has just been deported back to his home country of Spain. He describes how Israeli commandos boarded the ship in international waters and held them on the boat for over 24 hours while towing them to Israel. "They kidnapped us," he says.

*  But that is not the real story here. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=108.96s)]
*  The real story is that there is a genocide going on in Gaza and a systematic starvation [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=110.75999999999999s)]

*  the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, who was one of the 12 on board the Madeline flotilla to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=137.8s)]

*  of Spain. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=147.48s)]
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, Sergio Toribio. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=148.56s)]
*  Describe to us what happened when the Madeline flotilla was intercepted by Israeli forces [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=152.52s)]
*  in the middle of the night in international waters. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=158.0s)]
*  Yes, what I can say, we have this night watch between 12 and 4, and around 1 in the morning [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=162.0s)]
*  we have the visit of two fast boats that they didn't give any radio instruction or anything [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=172.88s)]
*  to us. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=182.6s)]
*  They used crosshairs by us, trying to intercept us, but nothing else. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=183.6s)]
*  When they left, we raised the alarm because we've been trained for that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=187.32s)]
*  We were trained in the last days, only we have some case of attack. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=192.28s)]
*  The thing is they left, they didn't say anything on the radio, and by 10, 15 minutes we have [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  a visit of a drone, a close-range drone. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=203.56s)]
*  This drone was trained to come very close to the ship, and he got hit one of the wires [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=207.64s)]
*  of the mast, and he left on the water. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=215.0s)]
*  So like two minutes later we got another two big drones, one with a very powerful light, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=217.68s)]
*  and the other was throwing over us, over the whole ship, over the cabin, over us, like [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=224.04s)]
*  a paste, white paste. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=230.0s)]
*  We didn't even know what is still there. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=232.32s)]
*  So we get close inside the cabin, the cabin with our life rags, ready to get assaulted, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=235.6s)]
*  because we trained, as I said. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=241.96s)]
*  And half an hour after this throwing this paste, we kind of find that when you touch [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=244.12s)]
*  it or get in contact with it, it gets black and very slippery, for example in the floors [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=252.12s)]
*  of the deck. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=258.52s)]
*  So at the end of this attack, two fast boats approached us by starboard and port side, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=260.12s)]
*  and then they gave us a message in English through the speakers, like they were about [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=266.88s)]
*  to embark us, they were not to harm us, they were trying to keep a bit lower the nerves, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=272.12s)]
*  no? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=280.68s)]
*  Rising hands, be quiet. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=281.68s)]
*  So at the end they boarded us like 12 well-armored with M4, shotguns, guns, knives, you know, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  covered up to the ace, more than 12 soldiers. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=291.48s)]
*  You know, they get us like closer in the cabin, we've been like master station, and they move [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  one per one, they move it on the bow of the ship. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  They asked us, they registered us, and when they gathered the 12, the medic of this command, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=305.84s)]
*  they come to us to ask for some medical condition, if someone was injured. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=312.8s)]
*  They offered some water, they offered some food, and they kept us in the deck of the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=319.84s)]
*  15 hours until like 12 in the morning, something like that, between 12 and 2, because I didn't [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=327.04s)]
*  have a clock. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=333.48s)]
*  It was when the sun started to really get burnt to us, they moved us inside the ship, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=334.48s)]
*  and they keep it under the decks for another 10 hours, 12 hours, until we reached Tel Aviv [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=341.04s)]
*  harbor. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=347.88s)]
*  And so Sergio, tell us what happened then. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=350.48s)]
*  If you can explain what happened when you were‚Äîwhat you were first brought into Ashdod, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=352.76s)]
*  and then why four of you were deported, you, Greta Thunberg, and two others, and others [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=358.4s)]
*  remain there in Israel. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=364.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  The thing is, after the army give the command to us from the ship to land to the police, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  to the Israeli police, and they registered us again, they pass it as the dose, I guess [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=375.12s)]
*  that these normal procedures, and they put us in tables with another agents trying to [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=380.88s)]
*  get us to sign. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=388.48s)]
*  We tried to enter in a military zone, but we've been at more than 100 miles in international [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=392.24s)]
*  waters. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=399.48s)]
*  That cannot be possible that it was a military zone, as they said. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=400.48s)]
*  So I get they kidnapped us, you know. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=404.1s)]
*  They forced us out. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=406.56s)]
*  And can you say why you‚ÄîSergio, can you say why you went on this ship, why you were [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=410.52s)]
*  part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, named for Gazan Fisherwoman, the first Gazan Fisherwoman? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=416.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=424.32s)]
*  I get this because I am an activist, and I thought that Palestinian people deserve that [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=426.96s)]
*  we put in the whole world, know, what is happening there, that is a genocide. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=432.68s)]
*  So for me, it's like I have the chance to join the flotilla, and I decide to help them [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=438.32s)]
*  in the way I can, no matter how. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=444.0s)]
*  And Sergio, you've said that you would do this all over again, if you could talk about [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=446.8s)]
*  that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=452.28s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=453.28s)]
*  I'm trying to get in this march from Egypt, from El Kairoulo. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=454.28s)]
*  But the thing is, it's a very short time. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=459.1s)]
*  I have a window very short. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=460.48s)]
*  So I don't think it's going to be possible this time. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=462.3s)]
*  But of course, I'm an activist, and I'm‚Äîyou know, for the last 11 years, I've been in [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=464.92s)]
*  Marine Protection, I've been rescuing people in the Mediterranean for two years and a half. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=469.0s)]
*  And now I have this chance to join the flotilla and to do any kind of pro-Gaza movement, you [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=473.48s)]
*  know, for help Palestinians, for fight against this genocide, you know. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=479.08000000000004s)]
*  And Sergio, can you tell us, since you've returned to Spain, what kind of reception [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=486.92s)]
*  have you received? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  The first for me was the diplomatic on Gaza's Migration Center in the airport on Tel Aviv. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=493.12s)]
*  It was our consul there and our bishop consul. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=502.04s)]
*  That was super nice to see how they behave and to see they've been worried, of course, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=505.64s)]
*  about what happened, you know, because we didn't make anything wrong. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=511.6s)]
*  And we didn't try to enter any kind of military zone. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=514.96s)]
*  We've been in the international waters trying to deliver some food, like symbolic, because [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=518.88s)]
*  my mission was to break the siege. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=523.96s)]
*  They are having illegally against these people, the Palestinian people, and in Gaza. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=528.04s)]
*  It was very nice and very warm to have also all the media teams waiting in Barcelona. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=533.52s)]
*  A friend I didn't know that was also waiting for me there, you know, from the Gaza movement, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=538.92s)]
*  from this flotilla coalition. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=545.24s)]
*  And of course, when I reacted to that this is my home, you can imagine my mom and my [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=547.92s)]
*  sister were there, that they were very, very worried about. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=552.04s)]
*  And do you see, Sergio, do you imagine more people joining the next time there is such [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=557.0s)]
*  a flotilla from other places in the world? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=561.86s)]
*  You just have 30 seconds. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=564.52s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that this is going to happen, you know, because now more and more people [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=566.96s)]
*  is knowing what is happening. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=572.4s)]
*  And not only, you know, we are a lot of different countries working on it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=574.84s)]
*  You know, not only the countries we've been in this flotilla, because it happened in other [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=580.52s)]
*  flotillas, and they attacked this. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=585.0s)]
*  I'm afraid we're going to have to leave it there, Sergio. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkQvQAtaxs&t=588.2s)]
