New York City comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested outside an immigration courtroom Tuesday. Lander has been volunteering as an observer and escort for people with immigration hearings in recent weeks. In this case, while accompanying a man named Edgardo, a group of ICE agents approached the two men, who were walking arm in arm. Lander asked repeatedly to see a judicial warrant before being handcuffed and detained. Lander was later released after New York Governor Kathy Hochul condemned the arrest and visited New York City to lobby for his release. Five other mayoral candidates also condemned Lander's arrest, although current Mayor Eric Adams has stayed silent. Adams "has sold this city out to Donald Trump to try to get his own pardon," says Lander. "Let's be clear: It's only himself he cares about, and he is putting New York's immigrants in harm's way."

*  You are not arresting them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=85.28s)]
*  You are not arresting them. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=88.28s)]
*  Where are you arresting them? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=91.28s)]
*  Hello? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=94.28s)]
*  Since you have no authority to arrest U.S. citizens, where are you taking them? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=95.28s)]
*  With what authority? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=102.28s)]
*  City Comptroller Brad Lander was held for several hours before being released when the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=104.28s)]
*  New York governor came down to demand this. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=110.68s)]
*  She had said what had happened was bull—she used the whole thing. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=114.14s)]
*  He exited the courthouse building accompanied by his wife, as well as Governor Kathy Hochul. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=118.26s)]
*  He spoke to supporters gathered outside the arrest and the man he was attempting to escort, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=125.14s)]
*  who he named Edgardo. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  I certainly did not assault an officer. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  I engaged in—anyway. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=135.18s)]
*  So, but I guess I just think here's the thing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=137.18s)]
*  Like, I know I will have due process. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=140.5s)]
*  And I will have a good lawyer. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=143.9s)]
*  And my rights will be protected. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=145.82s)]
*  But Edgardo has no due process rights and no lawyer. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=149.66s)]
*  And it's going to sleep tonight in God knows where in an ICE detention facility. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=153.22s)]
*  My goal was to walk Edgardo out of the building. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=158.22s)]
*  I can't tell you the bit of—like, we got to walk one family out today. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=161.86s)]
*  And now it's this family of four that's back at home. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=167.02s)]
*  Nothing would have made me happier to be able to get in that elevator and let Edgardo [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=170.46s)]
*  go about his business. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=175.26000000000002s)]
*  That was what I came to do, and it is all I want. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=176.82000000000002s)]
*  For more, we're joined in studio by the controller of the city of New York, Brad Lander. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=180.54000000000002s)]
*  Welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=186.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=187.46s)]
*  I last interviewed you when you were at a protest calling for the release of Mohsen [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=188.46s)]
*  Madhawi, Columbia student who was arrested in Vermont. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=194.62s)]
*  Talk about what happened yesterday. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=199.62s)]
*  I've been going down to immigration court now for the last three weeks since Department [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=201.18s)]
*  Homeland Security made this change and started basically stripping people of their status. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=206.3s)]
*  It's called dismissing their cases, which sounds good, except as soon as it happens, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=211.54000000000002s)]
*  you're subject to expedited removal. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  So they say the case is dismissed, the judge says that, and then ICE agents meet you at [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  the door and arrest you? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=223.34s)]
*  It's even a little worse than that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=224.58s)]
*  You know, you think in the courtroom maybe this is good. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=226.22000000000003s)]
*  People don't understand what's happening. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=228.76s)]
*  The person before, Edgardo's a person named Zed who speaks Yoruba, but the only translator [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  they had for him was in French, and the judge asked, do you understand what's happening? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=236.44s)]
*  And of course he said no. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=240.88s)]
*  So your case is dismissed, you're stripped of status, you walk out of the courtroom, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=243.2s)]
*  you walk down the hallway, and then those masked ICE agents are waiting in the elevator [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  lobby to grab you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=252.82s)]
*  And so what I had done with five families previously or individuals is just meet them [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=255.84s)]
*  either in the courtroom or just outside it and just try to escort them down the hallway, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=261.24s)]
*  into the elevator, and out of the building. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=265.32s)]
*  And five times previously, including once yesterday, my wife and I were able to do that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=268.1s)]
*  on this family that was worried they were going to get deported. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=272.94s)]
*  They only have one more week, but at least they have a chance to come back to court and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=275.8s)]
*  present their case. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=279.3s)]
*  But then in this case, as I was asking to see the judicial warrant, they just grabbed [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=280.3s)]
*  them up. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=286.32s)]
*  But don't you have a police escort of security? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=287.32s)]
*  So you have police versus ICE now? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=289.04s)]
*  The previous time, so you know, being a controller, I'm a city-wide elected official, it comes [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=292.0s)]
*  with an NYPD detail. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=295.66s)]
*  The previous times the officer accompanied me and the, you know, whatever the family [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=297.44s)]
*  or individual that I was walking with, this couple, Maria and Manuel, a father named Camilo [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=302.0s)]
*  and his son Brian, and I thought, great, here's the NYPD joining the controller to escort [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=306.8s)]
*  these asylum seekers out of the building to help them get to process and safety. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  In this case, obviously, that did not matter. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=318.56s)]
*  And look, I think what's happening here, go ahead. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=320.88s)]
*  Yeah, and Brad, it's been a while since we talked, but I wanted to ask you, you kept [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  saying to the ICE agents, where's your judicial warrant? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=331.76s)]
*  However, ICE is claiming that this was a public space and they didn't need a judicial warrant. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=335.56s)]
*  What's your understanding? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=340.6s)]
*  I mean, I'll leave this for the lawyers. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=341.6s)]
*  I am not an immigration lawyer. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=343.2s)]
*  What people have been instructed to ask, you know, is I need to see a judicial warrant. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=344.96s)]
*  And we're trying to get good information to these families. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=350.56s)]
*  What New York City should be doing is connecting people to lawyers and attorneys. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=353.46s)]
*  And you know, we've got a mayor here, Eric Adams, who sold New Yorkers out to Donald [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=358.08s)]
*  Trump and is failing to get people the information they need. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=362.64s)]
*  We could be talking to immigrant families in the schools, in the shelters, in the public [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=366.58s)]
*  hospital system. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=371.36s)]
*  But yes, asking for a judicial warrant is a good idea for people to do. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  Having a lawyer is even better. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=378.04s)]
*  And look, if they do proceed to charges here, I know I'll have one. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  Edgardo doesn't have one. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=383.64s)]
*  Zedd doesn't have one. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=384.76s)]
*  Thousands of people just trying to seek asylum don't have lawyers or do process rights. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=385.92s)]
*  And that is the tragedy right now. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=391.24s)]
*  This trend now throughout the country of federal agents basically roughing up and detaining [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=394.72s)]
*  or arresting elected officials. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=404.28000000000003s)]
*  Ros Baraka, the mayor of Newark, and a congresswoman there in California, a U.S. Senator, Alex [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=406.12s)]
*  Padilla, and now this situation with you? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=414.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=416.6s)]
*  I mean, and Pam Bondi was very clear. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=417.6s)]
*  They're trying to wreak havoc in cities. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=419.0s)]
*  They say to liberate democratic cities from their duly elected elected officials. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=421.16s)]
*  This is part of what authoritarians do, strike fear into immigrant families and communities [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  and try to undermine the rule of law and basic democracy by stoking conflict. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=432.48s)]
*  And that is what they're doing. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=437.32000000000005s)]
*  Our challenge is to find a way to stand up for the rule of law, for due process, for [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=439.0s)]
*  people's rights, and to do it in a way that is nonviolent and insistent, demands it, but [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=443.24s)]
*  also doesn't help them escalate conflict. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=449.72s)]
*  Let me ask you something. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=453.44s)]
*  There was a rally as you were being held inside, and your wife, who's a lawyer, she also spoke. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=454.44s)]
*  She wasn't taken like you were. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=459.16s)]
*  Mayor Adams sent police to break up that rally. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=463.32s)]
*  Did he ever support you? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you had Zoran Mondani there speaking out. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=468.32s)]
*  He's your competitor. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=471.0s)]
*  He is running for mayor as well. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=472.12s)]
*  You had Adrian Adams. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=474.2s)]
*  And Andrew Cuomo spoke out for you. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=477.24s)]
*  Michael Blake. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=479.96000000000004s)]
*  But what about the mayor? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=481.44s)]
*  Five mayoral candidates showed up, and I'm grateful to every one of them, including Zoran [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=483.2s)]
*  Mondani, who I've cross-endorsed. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo did not show up, but at least he issued a statement saying that my arrest [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=490.12s)]
*  was wrong. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=494.52s)]
*  Eric Adams, who has sold this city out to Donald Trump to try to get his own pardon, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=495.8s)]
*  let's be clear, like it's only himself he cares about, and he is putting New York's [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=501.56s)]
*  immigrants in harm's way. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=505.2s)]
*  So no, he did not call me. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=507.24s)]
*  He didn't do anything to help and issued a just rude statement. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=508.24s)]
*  I wanted to go to that co-endorsement because we want to get to rank choice voting. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=511.44s)]
*  It is not known to most people in this country what it is, but we're going to go to a clip [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=516.0s)]
*  right now of the two of you, Zoran Mondani and you, Brad Lander, endorsing each other, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=520.48s)]
*  what this means. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=526.08s)]
*  You're both running for mayor. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=527.08s)]
*  We both love New York City. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=528.08s)]
*  And that's why it's so important to not send scandal-ridden, corrupt Andrew Cuomo [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=530.36s)]
*  to City Hall. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=534.52s)]
*  New Yorkers deserve so much better than a disgraced creep. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=535.52s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=538.4399999999999s)]
*  Zoran, you've done a remarkable job building a historic grassroots campaign for a New York [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  City all New Yorkers can afford. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=543.6s)]
*  Brad, you've been a principled progressive leader in our city for years. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=545.56s)]
*  Early voting starts tomorrow and we both know what we need to do to save our city from Andrew [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  Cuomo. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=553.52s)]
*  You want to tell him? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=554.52s)]
*  You go first. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=555.52s)]
*  Yeah, you go first. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=556.52s)]
*  Let's do it together. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=557.52s)]
*  We're cross endorsing. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=558.52s)]
*  In New York City, we have rank choice voting. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=559.52s)]
*  That means you can rank up to five candidates for mayor. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=561.24s)]
*  Brad and I are officially telling our supporters. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=563.88s)]
*  Rank me number one. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=565.92s)]
*  Rank Zoran number two. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=567.32s)]
*  Let's send Andrew Cuomo. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=568.32s)]
*  Back to the suburbs. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=570.0s)]
*  So there you have a very confusing ad. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=572.4399999999999s)]
*  You're both running for mayor. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=574.52s)]
*  Explain rank choice voting and what this means. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=576.28s)]
*  Rank choice voting, instead of just getting one candidate, you can rank your preferences [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=578.6s)]
*  up to five. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=581.72s)]
*  Here's my number one candidate, my number two candidate. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=582.72s)]
*  So we're encouraging people, rank me number one, rank Zoran Mamdani number two. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=584.8s)]
*  rank Andrew Cuomo anywhere. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=588.84s)]
*  And that way our votes would get combined and whichever of us is ahead will face Andrew [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=591.1600000000001s)]
*  Cuomo with all of the combined votes. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=596.2800000000001s)]
*  Most New Yorkers don't want him to be mayor and rank choice voting can help make sure [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=599.24s)]
*  that happens. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=603.12s)]
*  In this last 20 seconds, New York for All Act, can you explain what it is, why you're [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=604.12s)]
*  supporting it? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=608.12s)]
*  New York City is a sanctuary city, but New York State needs to do more to protect immigrants, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=609.12s)]
*  not to allow collaboration with ICE and to provide more legal representation to people [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=613.96s)]
*  like Edgardo. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8POVraRFeU&t=618.72s)]
