Rescue workers in Washington, D.C., have launched a massive recovery operation in the Potomac River after a regional passenger jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided midair late Wednesday, with both aircraft crashing into the water. American Airlines Flight 5342 had 60 passengers and four crew members on board and was en route to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport from Wichita, Kansas. The Black Hawk helicopter had three soldiers on board conducting a training flight. Officials believe there are no survivors. The deadly crash comes amid upheaval and staffing changes in the Federal Aviation Administration and the Transportation Security Administration due to President Donald Trump's ongoing purge across federal government agencies. Journalist David Sirota of _The Lever_ says the airport also recently had its air traffic increased by lawmakers despite objections. "There is a very deep safety concern at this airport because there had been a series of near misses," says Sirota. "These warnings about expanding the flight traffic at this airport came just a few months ago." He also discusses the first 10 days of the Trump administration.

*  They say it was a training flight. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=133.76s)]
*  Can you talk about this piece that you wrote, Despite Mid-Flight Near Misses and Dire Pleas, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=137.04s)]
*  airline bankroll lawmakers recently expanded flight traffic at Washington's busy airport? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=144.92s)]
*  David, I just watched the news briefing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=151.48s)]
*  There was the two Virginia senators who objected to this expansion, right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  Tim Kaine, as well as Senator Warner. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=159.28s)]
*  They didn't mention that this morning, but if you can talk all about it, give us some [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=163.04s)]
*  background. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=167.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=168.0s)]
*  So, Washington National Airport is a relatively small airport and one of the busiest, if not [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=169.0s)]
*  the busiest airport in the country because of how close it is to the center of Washington, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=173.68s)]
*  D.C., the city there. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=179.28s)]
*  For years, there has been a debate about whether to expand the amount of flights that can go [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=181.72s)]
*  into Washington Reagan Airport. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=188.72s)]
*  And over the course of a few decades, there has been a steady increase in the number of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=192.6s)]
*  slots, that is to say, the amount of traffic at Washington National Airport, air traffic. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=198.28s)]
*  And just a few months ago, as we reported, that debate over how much to expand Washington [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  National hit a fever pitch in Congress. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  There's been a push by a set of airlines to expand those flights. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  There's some other airlines that don't want to expand those flights because they're already [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=219.16000000000003s)]
*  controlling those routes. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=222.8s)]
*  So there's a sort of an economic battle going on, who gets to control what routes. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=224.4s)]
*  But at the core of it, according to opponents of this, including the senators that you mentioned, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=230.0s)]
*  there is a very deep safety concern at this airport because there had been a series of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=235.4s)]
*  near misses, near collisions at the airport because it is so heavily trafficked. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=241.04s)]
*  So a few months ago, put into the FAA authorization bill was some language that further expanded [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=246.92s)]
*  these slots and also the perimeter. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=256.08s)]
*  That's the length of the flights that are allowed to come into Washington National. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=258.52s)]
*  Basically this is a, the opponents argue this is Congress people from cities farther away [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=262.8s)]
*  from Washington want more direct flights into Washington because it's more convenient for [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  them. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=275.4s)]
*  So it's a proponents argument. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=276.88s)]
*  But again, at the core is the safety question. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=277.88s)]
*  There have been real safety concerns again about these near misses at this particular [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=280.52s)]
*  airport. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  And so a few months ago, that language was slipped into the FAA reauthorization bill, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  which further expanded the traffic. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=291.84s)]
*  And it should be, it should be said when it actually came up for a vote in the house in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=293.4s)]
*  2023, the house voted it down. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  So there were some legislative machinations here in which the proponents of this had to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=302.2s)]
*  slip it into a larger bill kind of stealthily to get this expansion passed. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=307.2s)]
*  And Tim Kaine said he was very concerned about the prospect of collisions at this airport, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=314.96s)]
*  begging lawmakers to not do this. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  And could you talk David Sirota about the significance of the fact that the collision [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=324.68s)]
*  occurred with a Black Hawk helicopter? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=328.56s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, look, we don't know the yet the exactly what happened and what is at issue here with [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  an alleged training flight of helicopters. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=341.16s)]
*  But I think it's worth saying this. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=344.76s)]
*  If you've ever been near or flown into Washington National Airport, you can see it's some of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  the most heavily trafficked airspace in the world, including by the military. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=352.16s)]
*  So I think what we're talking about here is whether an airport that is already so stressed, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=360.12s)]
*  already so at capacity, arguably over capacity, whether it should have been, the air traffic [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=369.12s)]
*  should have been expanded, knowing, again, it's also additional special circumstance [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=376.35999999999996s)]
*  of being around so much additional air traffic vis-a-vis the military. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=381.4s)]
*  And this whole idea of who is in charge of the military flights, I mean, this is unusual [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=386.92s)]
*  at this airport as opposed to all others. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=391.96s)]
*  I was talking to someone who was saying that pilots actually most fear this airport. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=393.76s)]
*  It's one of the most dangerous in the country, where you have all these Black Hawk helicopters [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=398.36s)]
*  and they take military officials and other officials, and then you've got all the civilian [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=403.44s)]
*  flights that they keep increasing. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=407.8s)]
*  How much do they communicate with each other, David? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=409.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=412.44s)]
*  And I have seen some reporting saying that the radar wasn't communicating on this training [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=414.44s)]
*  flight. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=421.4s)]
*  I'm not sure that's been substantiated. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=422.4s)]
*  So I'm not trying to put out misinformation and disinformation. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=424.24s)]
*  These are just the questions. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=427.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=428.92s)]
*  It's only to say that, again, this particular space, this airspace, has been a known safety [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=429.92s)]
*  hazard for a very long time. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=439.6s)]
*  And certain airlines who spend money on lobbying Congress and campaign contributions to key [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=442.76000000000005s)]
*  members of Congress have been pushing to expand the amount of flights into this particular [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  airport. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=456.28000000000003s)]
*  And again, I just want to say one other thing here. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  This is a city that is served by a much larger airport farther out of the city, Dulles Airport. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=459.20000000000005s)]
*  And so the argument has been, listen, we should not expand the amount of flights going into [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=467.24s)]
*  Washington Reagan, even though it's more convenient for passengers when you get off the plane, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=471.96s)]
*  because it's closer to the city, because we have a larger airport a little bit further [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=476.62s)]
*  away. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  So the argument was, again, this is members of Congress who want, for their convenience, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  to fly to the closest airport to their office. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=487.71999999999997s)]
*  And the argument was that they were listening to their airline donors. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=491.68s)]
*  They were listening to their desire for their own convenience, not listening to the multiple [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=495.76s)]
*  safety warnings about this airport. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=499.88s)]
*  And let's remember it's called now Reagan National Airport, used to be National Airport, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=501.68s)]
*  known for President Reagan. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=506.64s)]
*  And President Reagan is known for breaking up the Patco Union, the air traffic controllers [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=508.08s)]
*  union back in the 1980s. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=514.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=516.72s)]
*  And there's a question, there's been questions, and I don't know if it's germane to what [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=518.76s)]
*  happened in this disaster, but there have been questions about air traffic control [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=522.48s)]
*  resources understaffing, the current staff being essentially overworked. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=527.5600000000001s)]
*  All of these questions have been swirling for years. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  And so our job at the lever, what we do is we look back at the decisions that were made [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=537.36s)]
*  in the lead up to situations like this. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=542.6800000000001s)]
*  And again, this came, these warnings about expanding the flight traffic at this airport [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=544.96s)]
*  came just a few months ago. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=550.48s)]
*  I mean, if you go read our story, you will see legislators warning, really dire pleas, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=552.72s)]
*  to not expand the amount of traffic at this airport. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=559.84s)]
*  David Cerote, you are editor-in-chief of the lever. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=562.6s)]
*  You are following what's happening in Washington extremely closely. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=566.6s)]
*  To say the least, we're talking about everything, everywhere, all at once, with the President [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=571.84s)]
*  inauguration and the number of executive orders, the number of hearings for his nominees [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=579.1600000000001s)]
*  to be in his cabinet. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  But you also have a massive amount of pushback. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=589.6s)]
*  If you can talk about what just took place, the significance, and just your take over [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=594.12s)]
*  the last 10 days, but the significance of cutting trillions of dollars or so-called [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=599.32s)]
*  pausing them, putting them on hold, and then because of the outcry, again, this hurting [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=605.48s)]
*  people, veterans, this hurting families in need, heeding, housing assistance, meals [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=610.84s)]
*  on wheels, Head Start, and suddenly after the chaos of just a number of hours, the Trump [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=618.1999999999999s)]
*  administration almost says, sorry, only kidding. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=624.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is really unprecedented. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=628.1999999999999s)]
*  I say that having worked in the U.S. House Appropriations Committee back during and after [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=631.52s)]
*  9-11. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=636.72s)]
*  So, I worked in the committees that dealt with the spending in this country, the budget [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=637.72s)]
*  in this country. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=643.56s)]
*  And I have never seen, back then, and following it since then, had never seen something this [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=645.12s)]
*  brazen. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=651.68s)]
*  Now, to be clear, the fight over the spending issue has been something that has happened [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=652.68s)]
*  in the distant past. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=658.12s)]
*  Richard Nixon tried to so-called impound, that's holding back money appropriated by [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=660.9599999999999s)]
*  Congress. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=666.3599999999999s)]
*  He tried to do that in the 70s. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=667.3599999999999s)]
*  Congress passed a very explicit law saying, no, you actually cannot do this. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=668.7199999999999s)]
*  Ronald Reagan explored doing this. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=673.24s)]
*  John Roberts, by the way, as we reported, sent a memo when he was working in the Reagan [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=675.16s)]
*  administration saying, essentially, the president does not have the power to unilaterally withhold [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=680.04s)]
*  spending authorized by Congress and enshrined in law. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=685.92s)]
*  The justice of the United States. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=689.88s)]
*  That's right. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=691.44s)]
*  And John Roberts would, if this kind of thing comes to the court, the Supreme Court, John [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=692.5600000000001s)]
*  Roberts would be weighing in on this. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=696.64s)]
*  Look, this is unprecedented. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=698.2800000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump effectively tried to unilaterally repeal the federal government by fiat, and [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=700.48s)]
*  he was rejected, essentially, by the American people. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=706.9200000000001s)]
*  He was rejected temporarily by a court. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=711.0400000000001s)]
*  And what I would say is, it is a warning about what is coming, that while the reversal happened [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=713.2s)]
*  very quickly because of the outcry, because of the mass chaos that it sowed, that chaos [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=719.88s)]
*  here is the goal, chaos in service of Trump grabbing more power for himself. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=726.12s)]
*  If he was successful in this, and he will try it again, what he will essentially do [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=732.4s)]
*  is render the legislature powerless. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=736.2s)]
*  He will essentially eliminate the authority of one of the branches of the U.S. government, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=739.16s)]
*  the checks and balances, the most democratic branch. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=744.8s)]
*  And the last thing I'll say here, Amy, which is really important, especially when it comes [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=747.32s)]
*  to spending, the reason the founders put the power of the purse in the power of the Congress [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=751.0s)]
*  and specifically in the power of the House is because the House and the Congress are [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=756.12s)]
*  the most small-d democratic parts of the government, the parts of the government that are supposed [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=761.36s)]
*  to be most responsive to the people. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=766.72s)]
*  So the president trying to take away that power of the purse is a direct assault on [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=768.88s)]
*  the founding principles that spending decisions are made by the most democratic parts of our government. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4cJtMVNqZY&t=776.08s)]
