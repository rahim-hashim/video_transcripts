We speak with journalist Mehdi Hasan of Zeteo News about the first 100 days of the second Trump administration, the ongoing Israeli war on Gaza, the suppression of pro-Palestine activism and more. Hasan is a former host for Al Jazeera and MSNBC who started his own news outlet last year. On Zeteo's first anniversary, he describes his frustrations while working for mainstream outlets and says the U.S. media continues to ignore Palestinian voices in coverage about the Middle East.

# "Fascism Isn't Coming, It's Here": Mehdi Hasan on Trump, Gaza & Leaving MSNBC to Start Zeteo
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc)
*  Democracy depends on a free press. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=0.0s)]
*  Please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=2.44s)]
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=7.8s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=11.4s)]
*  We are continuing our conversation with Mahdi Hassan, who is marking the first anniversary [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=13.0s)]
*  of his new site, Zateo, which he formed after leaving MSNBC. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=17.56s)]
*  Mahdi, you've closely covered the war in Gaza, as well as the Trump administration. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=22.0s)]
*  So if you could begin on Gaza. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=28.48s)]
*  On where we are right now? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=30.84s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=32.6s)]
*  I mean, some of us tried to say that Donald Trump would make things even worse. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=33.6s)]
*  There was a big debate during the election campaign where people understandably said, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=38.4s)]
*  it can't get any worse. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=42.0s)]
*  And the one thing you know about U.S. politics is it can always get worse. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=43.92s)]
*  And I think we've seen that with the Trump administration. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=47.92s)]
*  He came in with this great fanfare. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=49.8s)]
*  He had the fake ceasefire around the time of his inauguration. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=51.72s)]
*  He got a bit of credit from some folks. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  We always knew it was never going to last. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=56.38s)]
*  Netanyahu ended that ceasefire. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=58.08s)]
*  They're now killing people at rates even worse in many ways in 2024. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=59.8s)]
*  You guys began the show talking about 100 people killed in 24 hours. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=64.4s)]
*  And the world is numb to that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=69.12s)]
*  You know, in October, November, December of 2023, it was a huge story. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=70.12s)]
*  And today, people are shrugging their shoulders. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=74.24s)]
*  We're talking about ethnic cleansing of Gaza, relocating the entire population. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=76.52s)]
*  The Israeli government said this week that they will flatten everything that remains [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=80.6s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=84.24s)]
*  Netanyahu was quoted in Cabinet saying that, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=85.24s)]
*  We don't want to die with the Palestinians. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=87.64s)]
*  We want them to die alone, with Netanyahu's phrase to his own Cabinet ministers. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=89.72s)]
*  And, of course, Donald Trump himself has signed off on all of this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=93.24s)]
*  We're now having a mass starvation campaign. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=96.6s)]
*  During the Biden administration, it was bad enough saying, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  Are we going to get 100 trucks in? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=101.24s)]
*  200 trucks. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  Zero trucks have gone into Gaza since March the 2nd. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  You talk about the depersonalizing Palestinians. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=108.08s)]
*  In the United States, where the media manufactures consent, can you talk about the icing out [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=115.52s)]
*  of Palestinian voices? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  I mean, the fact that you're no longer at MSNBC, that you were forced out of MSNBC after [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  this incredible confrontation you had, questioning you had, interview with an Israeli spokesperson. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=130.4s)]
*  And your ongoing coverage of bringing those voices out. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=139.04s)]
*  So one thing I did at MSNBC, I was at MSNBC for three and a half years. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  And one thing, some of my colleagues, we had Eamon Mouyadine at the premiere of the film [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  last night, who still has a show at MSNBC, although he shares it now with three other [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=149.48s)]
*  hosts. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=153.2s)]
*  But one thing we did, and one thing Joy Reid, who's also left the network recently, had [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=154.2s)]
*  her show canceled. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=158.48s)]
*  And Ali Velshu, still at the network, thankfully, another great correspondent. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=159.48s)]
*  Some of us did was to try and platform Palestinian voices. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=165.48s)]
*  One of the problems we have, as you say, is they are iced out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=168.32s)]
*  Americans don't hear from Palestinians or Arabs or Muslims or people with actual expertise [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=171.2s)]
*  of the region or people who have spent time in Jenin, in the occupied West Bank, in Gaza. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  And that is a fundamental problem. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  You are getting a very one-sided view of the conflict. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=182.76s)]
*  What's ironic, Amy, is the recent Pew poll that came out showed the American public is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  actually for the first time more sympathetic, less sympathetic to Israel, much more critical. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  I think it was 52%. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=192.48s)]
*  I can't remember the exact number, but a majority of Americans were critical of Israel or are [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=193.48s)]
*  not supportive of Israel for the first time. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=197.44s)]
*  And I looked at that number, and I thought, wow, a majority of Americans, a slim majority, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=199.36s)]
*  that's despite the media coverage in favor of Israel. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=203.52s)]
*  Imagine if Americans actually got fair coverage of this conflict and actually heard from Palestinians. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=206.44s)]
*  Those numbers would be even higher. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=211.32s)]
*  And I think the real tragedy is that the media has been complicit in the Gaza genocide. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=213.56s)]
*  I'll give you one example. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=217.84s)]
*  Over the last few weeks, Palestinians have been starved in Gaza by the Israelis. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=219.28s)]
*  And according to one study, not a single Sunday show in this country has mentioned it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=224.7s)]
*  Mehdi, I just want to ask you what we reported also in headlines, the Reuters exclusive, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=229.22s)]
*  U.S. Israel Discussed Possible U.S.-Led Administration for Gaza. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=235.22s)]
*  Sources say they spoke to five people who corroborated reports that the U.S. and Israel [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=239.94s)]
*  are discussing the U.S. potentially leading a temporary postwar administration of Gaza. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=244.33999999999997s)]
*  Your response? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=249.26s)]
*  Kill me now is my response. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=251.01999999999998s)]
*  Kill me now. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=252.54s)]
*  Or do we live in an episode of idiocracy? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=253.54s)]
*  The American government sat around, forget Donald Trump, man's an idiot, ignoramus, couldn't [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=255.66s)]
*  find Gaza on a map. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=258.94s)]
*  But people in his administration, qualified people, sat around the table and said, hmm, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=260.09999999999997s)]
*  what should we do about Gaza, the biggest problem in the world today, geopolitical issue. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=264.94s)]
*  Let's do what we did in Iraq, right? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=268.74s)]
*  The Iraq, for those people who are watching who are not old enough to remember 2003, four, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=271.14s)]
*  five, I've interviewed Paul Bremer. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=275.18s)]
*  The Bush administration sent a viceroy, sent Paul Bremer to run the country with a bunch [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=277.26000000000005s)]
*  of kids. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=282.22s)]
*  Some of them were out, some of them had only, there was one guy who went out to the Greens [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=283.22s)]
*  that I famously remember who had only run an ice cream truck in college. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=285.98s)]
*  They sent a bunch of children and Paul Bremer to run Iraq like a colonial project. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=289.1s)]
*  It was an absolute disaster. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=293.58000000000004s)]
*  It increased sectarian tensions. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=295.06s)]
*  It increased violence. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=296.90000000000003s)]
*  It divided the country. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=297.98s)]
*  It fomented more violent resistance. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=299.34000000000003s)]
*  The idea that the people of Gaza, who have resisted Israeli occupation for decades, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=301.74s)]
*  are now going to say, well, we only had an issue with Israeli occupation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=306.66s)]
*  We're fine with a U.S. occupation. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=310.5s)]
*  This is absurd. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=312.22s)]
*  Some of us warned since October the 7th that if you really care about stopping Hamas, why [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=313.34000000000003s)]
*  are you creating the conditions for Hamas 2.0? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=317.7s)]
*  And this is going to be Hamas 3.0, Hamas on steroids, if you create a situation where [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=320.78000000000003s)]
*  the American government, American military is on the ground in Gaza trying to control [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=325.18s)]
*  the population. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=329.18s)]
*  I have an idea. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=330.62s)]
*  What did Trump tweet out? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=331.62s)]
*  That, I mean, the video, the 30-second video of Elon Musk, a gold statue of Trump, and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=332.62s)]
*  then Trump and Netanyahu on the beach? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=340.18s)]
*  No, on the beach. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=342.18s)]
*  He loves his AI videos of himself. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=343.18s)]
*  No, it's an insane video. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=344.18s)]
*  We all just moved on for it because there's so much happening in the news, but I'm glad [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=345.82s)]
*  you reminded that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=348.42s)]
*  Look, he's been consistently clear on one thing, ethnic cleansing, relocation of Palestinians, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=349.42s)]
*  creating Gaza the Riviera. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=354.38s)]
*  He's obsessed with the beachfront property because he's a real estate guy slash war [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=356.02s)]
*  criminal endorser. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=360.65999999999997s)]
*  A federal appeals court on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to transfer the abducted [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=361.65999999999997s)]
*  Tufts Fulbright Scholar International student Rumeza Ozturk from Louisiana back to Vermont, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=367.21999999999997s)]

*  You just interviewed the Massachusetts congressman, Marbreanna Presley, about her treatment. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=375.7s)]
*  Horrific treatment. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=380.58s)]
*  We are not just detaining foreign students in this country for speech crimes, Amy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=381.58s)]
*  We're torturing them, too. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=385.90000000000003s)]
*  If you listen to what happened to Badr Khan Suri, who's a Georgetown student who was also [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=387.18s)]
*  detained, the torture that he's gone through, the abuse, the sleeping on the floor, the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=391.22s)]

*  Ayanna Presley, congresswoman, told me that when she went to see her, she was denied health [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Op0DtbLpc&t=399.18s)]
