# Top U.S. & World Headlines — January 16, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [January 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsgQMoHs32Q)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Former President Donald Trump has won the Iowa caucus with a landslide, about 51 percent
*  of the vote.
*  Trump claimed victory in 98 of Iowa's 99 counties.
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis narrowly topped former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley
*  to place second in the first caucus of the 2024 election cycle.
*  New Hampshire will hold the first primary a week from today.
*  After placing fourth in Iowa, Vivek Ramaswamy suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump.
*  Just 14 percent of Iowa's registered Republicans participated in the caucus, in part due to
*  record low temperatures.
*  Trump's victory came despite his mounting legal troubles and his refusal to debate his
*  challengers.
*  During a victory speech, Trump repeated his vow to deport millions of immigrants if he
*  returns to the White House.
*  We're going to drill, baby, drill right away.
*  Drill, baby, drill.
*  We're going to seal up the border.
*  Because right now we have an invasion.
*  We have an invasion of millions and millions of people that are coming into our country.
*  That's Donald Trump speaking in Iowa.
*  Today, he'll be back in a New York courtroom for the start of E. Jean Carroll's second
*  defamation trial against him.
*  The first found Trump had sexually assaulted the New York writer in the 90s, then defamed
*  her and may a jury awarded Carroll $5 million.
*  At this new trial, a different jury will determine if Trump owes her more money for other acts
*  of defamation.
*  Israel's bombardment and siege in Gaza has entered its 102nd day.
*  Palestinian health officials say Israeli attacks have killed 158 civilians in Gaza over the
*  past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to over 24,000.
*  The dead include more than 10,000 children.
*  On Sunday, President Biden released a statement marking 100 days since the October 7th Hamas
*  attack.
*  In the statement, Biden decried Hamas for continuing to hold more than 100 hostages,
*  but he made no mention of tens of thousands of Palestinians killed, injured or displaced
*  during Israel's indiscriminate assault.
*  Major rallies calling for a ceasefire in Gaza were held around the world this weekend.
*  In Washington, D.C., organizers said as many as 400,000 people took part in a march Saturday.
*  The rally was held just two days after South Africa brought its historic genocide case
*  against Israel to the Hague.
*  Speakers at Saturday's rally in Washington included independent presidential candidate
*  Cornell West.
*  And I say personally to Biden and company, you're not just enabling, you're not just
*  facilitating, you're not just co-acculating and co-operating with vicious crime of genocide.
*  That makes you war criminals yourself.
*  You ought to be shamed.
*  Who do you think we are?
*  You think that you can suppress the love that we have for our Palestinian brothers and sisters?
*  No, you got the wrong people.
*  Tension is continuing to escalate across the Middle East.
*  On Monday, Houthi forces from Yemen fired a missile that hit a U.S.-owned cargo ship
*  in the Gulf of Aden.
*  The attack came after the U.S. and U.K. bombed Houthi sites in Yemen Thursday and again Friday.
*  Houthi officials have vowed to keep attacking ships linked to Israel, they say, as well
*  as U.S. and British ships, until a ceasefire is reached in Gaza.
*  In support of the grievances of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, who are subjected
*  to the most heinous types of massacres by the Zionist entity and in response to the
*  American-British aggression against our country, the naval forces of the Yemeni Houthi armed
*  forces, with the help of Allah Almighty, carried out a military operation targeting
*  a U.S. ship in the Gulf of Aden with a number of appropriate naval missiles, and the hit
*  was accurate and direct.
*  In Iraq, at least four people were killed earlier today when Iran bombed what it described
*  as Israeli spy headquarters near Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan.
*  Iraq's denied the building struck was tied to the Mossad.
*  Masroor Bazani, the prime minister of the Kurdistan region, described the attack as
*  a, quote, crime against the Kurdish people, unquote.
*  Iran says it also bombed targets in northern Syria linked to ISIS.
*  The U.S. State Department condemned the Iranian attack near Erbil, describing it as reckless.
*  This comes less than two weeks after the U.S. assassinated the leader of an Iranian-backed
*  militia in Baghdad, which the U.S. claimed was done in self-defense.
*  In Guatemala, Bernardo Arevalo was sworn in as president early Monday morning after opposition
*  lawmakers delayed the transfer of power by nine hours in the latest effort by Guatemala's
*  elite to weaken the anti-corruption crusader now president.
*  Arevalo shocked Guatemala's elite in August by winning the presidential election.
*  Ever since, then-Guatemala's Attorney General Consuelo Porras has led a campaign to block
*  him from taking office.
*  Bernardo Arevalo is the son of former President Juan Jose Arevalo, Guatemala's first democratically
*  elected leader.
*  Arevalo spoke Monday after he was finally sworn in.
*  Guatemala has suffered deep wounds that require healing.
*  These scars are not only reflected in indicators or in technocratic exercises that assess the
*  country's reality.
*  They are rooted in the daily experiences of our communities.
*  We'll go to Guatemala after headlines.
*  Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party has won its third consecutive presidential
*  victory.
*  Taiwan's Vice President Lai Ching-Tai won Saturday's election in a vote closely watched
*  in Beijing and Washington.
*  China vocally opposed his candidacy and has described the president's elect as a, quote,
*  dangerous separatist, unquote.
*  Lai Ching-Tai spoke on Saturday.
*  We hope that both sides of the Taiwan Strait can return to healthy and orderly exchanges
*  in the future.
*  Indeed, as you have mentioned, President Tai-Yin Wen has continuously extended goodwill over
*  these eight years.
*  Unfortunately, China has not provided an appropriate response.
*  The Taiwanese people have taken action to successfully resist the intervention of external
*  forces.
*  This is because we believe in electing our own president.
*  China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi responded to the vote in Taiwan by issuing a harsh warning
*  to anyone in Taiwan who seeks independence.
*  Taiwan has never been a country, not in the past and certainly not in the future.
*  Taiwanese independence has never been possible.
*  Taiwan has never been a country, not in the past and certainly not in the future.
*  Taiwanese independence has never been possible.
*  It has not been possible in the past, and it will never be possible in the future.
*  Anyone on the island of Taiwan who wants to pursue Taiwanese independence or split China's
*  territory will be severely punished by history and law.
*  And the longtime Black liberation activist Sikho Udingo has died at the age of 79.
*  He was a member of Malcolm X's Organization of Afro-American Unity, as well as the Black
*  Panther Party in New York City and the Black Liberation Army.
*  After spending years underground, he was convicted in 1984 of charges related in part to his
*  role in helping Asada Shakur escape prison.
*  Udingo served 33 years in state and federal prison before being released.
*  In 2016, Sikho Udingo appeared on Democracy Now! and talked about why he initially joined
*  the Black Panthers.
*  What attracted me more than anything else was the stand against police brutality, because
*  like all the other ghettos in this country or Black areas of this country, police brutality
*  was running rampant.
*  That was the attraction, the big attraction for me personally.
*  And many of the comrades that I came in with, because they really—we were not part of
*  the civil rights movement that turned the other cheek.
*  We were mostly followers of the Malcolm X position that if someone smacks you, you smack
*  them back.
*  If someone punch you, you punch them back.
*  That your life was the biggest and best thing you had, and you had a right to, not only
*  protect it, but to defend it by any means necessary.
*  Black liberation activist Sikho Udingo speaking in 2016 on Democracy Now!
*  He's died at the age of 79.

*  Hi, Amy, and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around
*  the world.
