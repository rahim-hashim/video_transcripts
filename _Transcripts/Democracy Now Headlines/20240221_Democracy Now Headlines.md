**Democracy Now!:** [February 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7DcuE2FZdA)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The U.S. vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
*  It was the third ceasefire veto issued by the U.S. at the U.N. body.
*  This is Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour.
*  The message given today to Israel with this veto is that it can continue to get away with
*  murder.
*  Israel cannot and should not and will not get away with it.
*  We will not allow it.
*  This veto does not absolve Israel of its obligations nor of those who shield it.
*  The U.S. circulated its own resolution this week calling for a temporary ceasefire as
*  soon as practicable, unquote.
*  This comes as the death toll and humanitarian crisis in Gaza continue to mount.
*  The World Food Program has been forced to pause food aid to northern Gaza due to the
*  chaotic conditions.
*  UNICEF has warned at least one in six children in the north are acutely malnourished.
*  In southern Gaza, the World Health Organization Tuesday completed a second evacuation mission
*  from the beleaguered Nasser Hospital, which was rendered nonfunctional after Israeli attacks.
*  This is the WHO's Julio Martinez.
*  You can think about the worst situation ever.
*  You multiply by 10, and this is the worst situation I have seen in my life.
*  It's the debris, the light, working in the darkness, patients everywhere.
*  The World Health Organization says there are still some 150 patients and medical workers
*  who remain on site at Nasser Hospital in life-threatening conditions.
*  Lebanese media has said one woman was killed in Israeli shelling in the town of Magdalzoun
*  in southern Lebanon.
*  Israeli missiles also hit the Kafir Sousa district in the Syrian capital Damascus.
*  Back in the United States, Jewish-American activists and others condemned President Biden
*  as he attended a lavish fundraiser hosted by the pro-Israel Democratic megadoner billionaire
*  Chaim Saban in Los Angeles.
*  Yemen's Houthi movement said Tuesday it struck an Israeli cargo ship in the Gulf of
*  with missiles and targeted a number of U.S. warships in the Red and Arabian Seas.
*  The Houthis also claimed attacks at several sites in the southern Israeli town of Eilat.
*  The latest assaults come after U.S. officials reported Monday Houthi fighters had also shot
*  down a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone flying near Yemen.
*  The Houthis have vowed to keep targeting ships until Israel stops its attacks on Gaza.
*  The Biden administration said it's preparing major sanctions against Russia in response
*  to the death of Alexei Navalny in an Arctic prison, which it has blamed on President Vladimir
*  Putin.
*  Meanwhile, in Russia, Navalny's family is building pressure for Russian prison authorities
*  to release the body of Navalny.
*  The ex-social media account of Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, was temporarily suspended
*  after she posted a video statement accusing Putin of killing Navalny and hiding his body
*  to cover up the assassination.
*  Navalnaya has vowed to take over from her husband and lead the opposition movement.
*  In Spain, the body of a man who was found shot dead last week is believed to be a Russian
*  pilot who defected to Ukraine in a military helicopter six months ago.
*  Maxim Kuzmenov's body was reportedly found in an underground garage with multiple bullet
*  wounds.
*  In response to the news, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service director referred to
*  Kuzmenov as a traitor and moral corpse.
*  In London, lawyers for the U.S. government are arguing before the British High Court
*  that Julian Assange should be extradited to the United States, where he faces espionage
*  charges and life in prison, 175 years, for publishing classified documents exposing U.S.
*  war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan.
*  The appeal is likely the last chance for the imprisoned WikiLeaks founder to avoid extradition.
*  Julian Assange's wife Stella debriefed crowds of supporters Tuesday after the defense presented
*  its case to the court.
*  Whatever happens in the coming days, it's now been aired in court.
*  The murder plots, the political motivation coming out of Mike Pompeo's obsession with
*  killing Julian, and the murders that Julian exposed in Iraq and Afghanistan, the torture
*  program that European countries willingly participated in.
*  We free Julian.
*  We regain our democracy.
*  Later in the broadcast, we'll go to London outside the High Court.
*  In Pakistan, two major parties, the Pakistan People's Party and the Pakistan Muslim League,
*  NWAZ, have agreed to form a coalition following intense negotiations.
*  Elections earlier this month ended without any party receiving a parliamentary majority,
*  though ousted and jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan's PTI party secured the most
*  seats in a major upset.
*  Another former prime minister, Shabazz Sharif, has been named as the coalition's candidate
*  for prime minister.
*  This comes as a top administrative official confessed to vote tampering and resigned.
*  After making the stunning admission, he expressed regret for, quote, stabbing the country in

*  The doctors have been identified as Asel Herrera Correa and Landy Rodriguez Hernandez.
*  Authorities in Rwanda have rejected calls by the U.S. government to withdraw its troops
*  and missile systems from eastern Congo as clashes escalate in the region.
*  Rwanda is accused of supporting the M23 militia.
*  The intensifying conflict between the Democratic Republic of Congo's army and M23 has disrupted
*  food supply lines to the eastern city of Goma, impacting more than two million people.
*  This will result in famine because all of us in Goma depend on the Minovo Road for agricultural
*  products.
*  They must do everything to reopen this road.
*  I am convinced that opening this road will resolve the problem and everything will be
*  fine.
*  The country's authorities must do everything in their power to end the war.
*  It's sure that after the war, everything will be fine.
*  They must do everything to end this war.
*  Congolese protesters have called out Western countries' complicity in the worsening violence
*  and humanitarian crisis in eastern Congo as millions have been displaced.
*  Back in the United States, the Supreme Court rejected a case challenging the admissions
*  policy at a prestigious Virginia high school, which has increased the school's diversity.
*  The Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, frequently ranked the country's
*  changed its admissions policy in 2020, resulting in a 6% increase in Latinx students and an
*  8% boost in black students.
*  The new policy also allowed for more low-income students, English language learners and girls
*  to be accepted into the school.
*  Plaintiffs argued the policy discriminates against Asian Americans whose representation
*  in the student body fell from roughly 70 to 50 percent.
*  Last year, the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions.
*  In a decision that shocked many in the medical community, the Alabama Supreme Court has ruled
*  frozen embryos should be considered children.
*  The ruling came in a case filed by a couple who sued a fellow patient who accidentally
*  dropped a test tube, destroying the frozen embryos of the couple.
*  The Alabama justices ruled the frozen embryos should be afforded the same protection as
*  babies under the wrongful death of a minor act.
*  Reproductive rights advocates say the ruling could result in the end of in vitro fertilization
*  in Alabama and some other states.
*  In Oklahoma, a 16-year-old non-binary high school sophomore died earlier this month,
*  the day after they were assaulted by three girls in a high school bathroom.
*  The student, Nex Benedict, reportedly suffered severe head injuries during the fight, but
*  officials at Owasso High School reportedly did not call an ambulance.
*  According to one account, Nex Benedict died due to complications from brain trauma.
*  Family members said Nex faced bullying since last year.
*  In 2022, Oklahoma lawmakers passed a law banning transgender students from using bathrooms
*  that correspond to their gender identity.
*  And more information has emerged about the ex-FBI informant who was indicted for lying
*  about President Biden and his son Hunter Biden receiving millions of dollars from the Ukrainian
*  energy company Burisma.
*  Prosecutors say Alexander Smirnoff blamed Russian intelligence agents for sharing the
*  false information about the Bidens.
*  A judge in Las Vegas ordered Smirnoff's release on bond Tuesday pending trial.
*  He's also required to surrender his U.S. and Israeli passports.
*  The lies about the Bidens are central to Republican efforts to impeach the president.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
