Before Guantánamo became what it's known for — the "forever prison in the war on terror" — its "ambiguous sovereignty" as a U.S. military base was long utilized to incarcerate Caribbean asylum seekers to the U.S. We speak to scholar Miriam Pensack, who researches the history of Guantánamo, in light of President Trump's recent proposal to once again imprison asylum seekers at the base's prison complex. Pensack says that existing racist anti-migration policies in the Caribbean, including the Dominican Republic's detention and deportations of people with Haitian ancestry, suggest a likely collaboration with Trump's anti-immigrant agenda.

# Trump's Mass Detention Plan for Guantánamo Harkens Back to U.S. Detention of Haitian Asylum Seekers
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s)
*  I also wanted to ask Miriam Pensac about Guantanamo, the Pentagon saying some 300 additional soldiers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=0.0s)]
*  have arrived at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have begun constructing a tent [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=8.4s)]
*  city to detain up to 30,000 immigrants and asylum seekers. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  On Monday, the Cuban president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, condemned the Trump administration's attack [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=18.92s)]
*  on asylum seekers. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=23.8s)]
*  This is what he said. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=24.96s)]
*  For Cuba, the violent and indiscriminate deportation of immigrants by the United States, arbitrary [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=26.44s)]
*  detentions and other human rights violations are unacceptable. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=35.4s)]
*  These measures are also used as a political pressure and blackmail weapon against the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=39.4s)]
*  peoples of our America. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=43.72s)]
*  The establishment of a detention center at the American naval base in Guantanamo, where [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=45.68s)]
*  it is intended to imprison tens of thousands of people, constitutes a barbaric act. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=50.24s)]
*  So that's the president of Cuba. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=56.92s)]
*  Miriam Pensac, your forthcoming book is on Guantanamo. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  Can you give us the history of how the U.S. has used it? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=62.96s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=67.12s)]
*  So something that I should mention first and foremost is that before Guantanamo became [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=68.52000000000001s)]
*  what it was known for in the early 21st century, this sort of forever prison and the war on [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=74.84s)]
*  terror, the way that its ambiguous sovereignty as a U.S. base, coercively held on Cuban soil, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=79.0s)]
*  functioned was to hold tens of thousands of circum-Caribbean asylum seekers, first from [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=87.08s)]
*  Haiti, roughly 40,000 from Haiti, then 35,000 Cubans who fled the island during what was [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=92.28s)]
*  called the Special Period, so the collapse of the Soviet Union, which prompted the total [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=98.56s)]
*  collapse of Cuba's economy in the mid-'90s. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  So this is actually a sort of back to basics, unfortunately, for Guantanamo. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=107.2s)]
*  And those initiatives, first the Haitian internment and then the Balsito crisis of Cuban rafters [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=114.08s)]
*  a few years later, what happened with the Haitians, they were by and large repatriated [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=121.56s)]
*  to extremely dangerous conditions in Haiti, where a coup had taken place against Haiti's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=126.12s)]
*  first democratically elected president, Jean-Breton de Herestide, and Cubans eventually made it [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=131.92s)]
*  to the United States, but not after effectively being held in what were concentration camp, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  detention camp-like conditions in Guantanamo. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=147.92s)]
*  And they were allowed into the United States because, in part because of the establishment [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=151.48s)]
*  of what became known as wet foot, dry foot. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=154.84s)]
*  Yeah, I also wanted to ask you about the Dominican Republic, where Rubio will also be visiting. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  The Dominican Republic has for years been involved in its own migration crackdown against [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=166.4s)]
*  Haitians within the country, massive attempts to deport Haitians from the DR. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  What do you sense might come out of Rubio's visit there? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=182.24s)]
*  I think there will definitely be a willingness to collaborate on immigration and deportation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=187.84s)]
*  The Dominican Republic has been building a wall between itself and Haiti, which it shares [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=197.16s)]
*  the island of Hispaniola with. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=204.0s)]
*  There have been these mass attempts to deport Haitians. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=207.16000000000003s)]
*  There have also been efforts to strip Dominican citizens of their citizenship if they are [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  very, what has been in many cases very flimsy proof of Haitian origin or provenance. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  So it's very anti-black because Haiti was the first black republic. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=224.84s)]
*  And Haitians are, there are plenty of black Dominicans, I should say. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=229.56s)]
*  But there is a huge degree of anti-blackness involved in that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  And the Dominican Republic has in fact left some of its citizens who it deemed Haitian [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=237.44s)]
*  stateless because Haiti did not recognize them as Haitian citizens. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blks5cRvR4s&t=244.44s)]
