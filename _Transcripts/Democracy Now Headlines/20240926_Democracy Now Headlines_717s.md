# Top U.S. & World Headlines — September 26, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx0-z_J4Iu0)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, War, Peace and the Presidency.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel's rejected a possible ceasefire as it continues its assault on Lebanon.
*  The U.S., France, Canada, Australia, Japan, Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have called
*  for a 21-day ceasefire as the death toll in Lebanon tops 620 people, at least 72 of those
*  killed Wednesday.
*  Despite resounding international warnings against escalating attacks, Israel's doubling
*  down with its military chief, Heratzi Halevi, telling troops on the front line Wednesday,
*  "'You hear the jets overhead.
*  We have been striking all day.
*  This is both to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah.'"
*  Half a million people in Lebanon are now believed to be displaced.
*  Hospitals are overrun with victims of Israeli attacks.
*  This is Dr. Adel Rai, director of the Rai Hospital in Sidon.
*  Since Monday until today, we have received 136 wounded, including 36 martyrs.
*  Among those 36 martyrs, 18 were torn to pieces.
*  There are still bodies in the morgue that require DNA testing for identification.
*  We'll go to Lebanon for the latest later in the broadcast.
*  Here in New York, Lebanon's interim prime minister, Najib Makati, pleaded with the U.N.
*  Security Council Wednesday to intervene to stop Israel's bombardment during an emergency
*  session.
*  He said, quote, "'Israel is violating our sovereignty by sending their warplanes and
*  drones to our skies,' unquote.
*  Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi spoke from the sidelines of the U.N. Security Council
*  meeting Wednesday.
*  ABBAS ARAGHCI, Foreign Minister of Iran
*  The Security Council must act now to halt Israel's war and enforce an immediate ceasefire,
*  and by that, to save innocent lives.
*  If not, the region risks full-scale conflict, and history will hold Israel's enablers,
*  especially the United States, responsible.
*  Iran will not remain indifferent in case of a full-scale war in Lebanon.
*  We stand with the people of Lebanon with all means.
*  This comes as a new Oxfam report is calling for urgent reform of the, quote, colonial
*  and archaic, unquote, U.N. Security Council.
*  Oxfam says the U.N. Security Council's five permanent members—U.S., Russia, China, the
*  U.K. and France—are all failing people living in conflict as they consistently abuse their
*  veto power in their own interests, blocking opportunities for peace around the world.
*  In Gaza, displaced Palestinians are expressing solidarity with Lebanese people under Israeli
*  attack.
*  NOUM EDIT, Israeli Foreign Minister
*  What is happening to us in Gaza is happening to Lebanon now.
*  I have been displaced from the north for the last five months, and the world is quiet and
*  is still standing by Israel.
*  How is it the world is standing by it?
*  In what viewpoint are they standing by them?
*  How did they see the oppressor and how did they see the oppressed?
*  I don't understand how.
*  I don't know how to comprehend this in my head.
*  This mass genocide, the massacre of children, women, elderly, and making us live in tents
*  and crisis that have no end, and now they are doing the same to Lebanon.
*  But the war will not end unless it ends in Lebanon.
*  If it ends in Lebanon, it will end in Gaza.
*  Elsewhere in Gaza, the Palestinian health ministry refused to receive an Israeli truck
*  filled with the unidentified remains of 88 Palestinians killed by Israel.
*  A distraught mother searching for her missing son went to meet the truck.
*  I got a call telling me there are dead bodies coming from Israel.
*  I came running to see if my son is fine or dead.
*  I want to know if he's among the dead bodies.
*  Look, these are dead bodies being thrown.
*  They throw it to the people, left them to the streets.
*  And their families cannot identify their bodies.
*  Here is the truck.
*  The bodies are inside.
*  We cannot see them.
*  The Committee to Protect Journalists reports an unprecedented number of journalists and
*  media workers have been arrested by Israeli forces across the occupied West Bank over
*  the last year.
*  The CPJ has documented a total of 54 such arrests since October 7.
*  Thirty-six remain jailed, including 14 held without charge under Israel's administrative
*  detention policy.
*  Among them is Palestinian journalist Mujahid al-Sadi, who was beaten, along with his wife,
*  by Israeli soldiers during a violent raid on their home in the early hours of September
*  19.
*  He has since had no contact with his lawyer or family.
*  In Sudan, the military has launched airstrikes and artillery attacks in Khartoum as it undertakes
*  a major offensive to retake control of the capital city from the paramilitary Rapid Support
*  Forces.
*  This comes as Sudan's Health Ministry announced more than 430 people have died of cholera
*  in the past month.
*  Meanwhile, the Doctors Without Borders reports pregnant people and newborn babies are dying
*  in shocking numbers after the conflict led to the collapse of Sudan's health system.
*  Sudan's military leader, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is addressing the U.N. General
*  Assembly in New York today.
*  Federal agents searched the official residence of New York City Mayor Eric Adams early Thursday
*  morning, just hours before prosecutors are expected to reveal details of a federal criminal
*  indictment against the mayor.
*  This morning, the indictment remains sealed in Manhattan federal court.
*  The New York Times reports investigators are looking into whether Adams conspired with
*  the Turkish government to funnel illegal foreign donations into his mayoral campaign.
*  They're also probing his ties to five other countries—China, Israel, South Korea, Uzbekistan
*  and Qatar.
*  A growing number of Democrats have called on Adams to resign, including New York Congressmember
*  Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez.
*  We'll have the latest on the federal corruption probe into Mayor Eric Adams and his administration
*  after headlines.
*  We'll speak with a reporter and the first New York City councilmember to call for his
*  resignation.
*  The Congressional Black Caucus is calling for Louisiana Republican Congressmember Clay
*  Higgins to be censured after he posted, then deleted under pressure, a racist diatribe
*  criticizing Haitian immigrants as thugs.
*  On Wednesday, Congressman Higgins mocked the nonprofit Haitian Bridge Alliance after it
*  filed criminal charges against Donald Trump and J.D. Vance in Ohio for their repeated
*  lies that Haitian immigrants in Springfield are eating their neighbors' pets.
*  Higgins wrote on social media, quote, "'Lol, these Haitians are wild, eating pets, voodoo,
*  the nastiest country in the Western Hemisphere.
*  Cults slapstick gangsters, but damned if they don't feel all sophisticated now, filing
*  charges against our president and VP.
*  All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January
*  20th,' the MAGA Congressmember said.
*  Lawmakers are set to vote on the censure resolution when the House returns from its recess after
*  the November election.
*  The U.S. Senate Wednesday unanimously passed a resolution honoring Wadi Afayoumi, the six-year-old
*  Palestinian-American boy from Illinois who was murdered in a hate crime last October
*  shortly after Israel launched its assault on Gaza.
*  CARE, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said, quote, "'His murder is a painful reminder
*  of the deadly consequences of anti-Palestinian hate and Islamophobia.'"
*  Chicago Congressmember Adelia Ramirez, one of the resolution's authors, is calling
*  on her colleagues to swiftly pass the companion House resolution.
*  You can see our recent interview with Congressmember Ramirez at DemocracyNow.org.
*  He was murdered by his white landlord.
*  Former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has endorsed a global fossil fuel nonproliferation
*  treaty.
*  The world has come together many times to tackle significant threats, saving the ocean,
*  banning landmines, negotiating a nuclear ban treaty.
*  Now, we must do it again, this time for fossil fuels, an industry that fuels the climate
*  crisis, wars, biodiversity loss and air pollution.
*  To learn more about the Fossil Fuel Nonproliferation Treaty Initiative, you can see our interview
*  this week with its president, Kumi Naidu, at DemocracyNow.org.
*  And Mexico protesters are commemorating the 10th anniversary of the disappearance of 43
*  students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers College.
*  Family members continue to demand justice and accountability for the members of Mexico's
*  armed forces and police, who work with a local drug cartel to abduct the students
*  in Guerrero State on September 26, 2014.
*  This is a lawyer for the relatives of the disappeared.
*  Here we are present.
*  The movement will continue.
*  Whoever governs, we will continue to demand the return of our comrades alive.
*  Whoever governs, we will continue to demand punishment for those responsible.
*  Whoever governs, we will continue to demand the whereabouts of our 43 comrades.
*  In Thailand, same-sex couples will be able to get married starting in January, after
*  the Thai King signed a recently passed bill into law.
*  Thailand becomes the first country in Southeast Asia to recognize same-sex marriage.
*  Activists celebrated the milestone in Bangkok.
*  Finally, it's official.
*  Even though it's something that humans shouldn't inherently have, we just feel relieved more
*  than anything.
*  I believe that many people who have fought for this bill have experienced a wide range
*  of emotions—stress, intensity or joy—as they waited.
*  There have been many feelings from the beginning up until this very moment.
*  And Palestinian journalist Bisan Alda has won a news and documentary Emmy for her Al Jazeera
*  Plus report, It's Bisan from Gaza and I'm Still Alive, a group of Hollywood celebrities
*  and pro-Israel groups unsuccessfully attempted to disqualify Alda's widely acclaimed report,
*  which chronicles her family's forced evacuation of their home in Beit Hanun after Israel launched
*  its assault on Gaza.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, the War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  And I'm Nermeen Shaikh.
*  Welcome to our listeners and viewers across the country and around the world.
*  Thank you.
