Pankaj Mishra's new book, _The World After Gaza: A History_, was written as a response to the "vast panorama of violence, disorder and suffering that we're seeing today," says the author. In Part 1 of our interview with the award-winning Indian writer, Mishra shares why he "felt compelled" to respond to what he sees as a return to the 19th-century model of "rapacious imperialism" in the Western world, signified by global complicity in Israel's genocide in Gaza.

*  But first we go to Gaza, where a deal has been reached for the ceasefire to continue. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=34.300000000000004s)]

*  Israel had threatened to resume the war on Gaza if the hostages were not freed as scheduled. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=45.06s)]
*  For more, we're joined in London by Bankaj Mishra, his latest book, The World After Gaza, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=49.64s)]
*  which places the latest war since October 7, 2023, in a larger context of Western colonialism. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=56.7s)]
*  In his prologue to the book, he writes, quote, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=65.06s)]
*  Bankaj Mishra is also author of Age of Anger, a history of the present. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=76.86s)]

*  He writes regularly for The Guardian and the New York Review of Books, among other publications. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=89.38s)]
*  Bankaj Mishra, welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=94.3s)]
*  It's an honor to have you with us. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  Why don't you respond to the latest news? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=98.69999999999999s)]
*  The ceasefire apparently will continue after President Trump said, oh, hell will break [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  loose. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=107.61999999999999s)]
*  Hamas doesn't release more hostages on Saturday. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=109.14s)]
*  And Hamas said the reason they had been holding out was that they said that Israel had broken [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=112.7s)]
*  the ceasefire agreement hundreds of times. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=117.74000000000001s)]
*  Your overall thoughts? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=120.9s)]
*  Well, you know, I think the ceasefire remains extremely fragile, because there's a new [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=122.38000000000001s)]
*  element there, injected by a volatile U.S. president who, you know, keeps issuing these [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=129.9s)]
*  threats randomly. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=136.78s)]
*  You know, I don't know whether he'll be satisfied with the release of just three hostages [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=140.18s)]
*  on Saturday. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=145.14s)]
*  He might change his mind tomorrow or today. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=146.14s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=148.34s)]
*  So the ceasefire remains, you know, extremely fragile, and I think it's because Trump has [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=149.74s)]
*  now announced his plans for ethnic cleansing Gaza. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=154.9s)]
*  And I think Hamas or other militant groups have less and less incentive to keep to their [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=160.82000000000002s)]
*  side of the deal. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=166.86s)]
*  And we know that the far-right regime in Israel completely endorses Trump's plan and can't [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=167.86s)]
*  wait to, you know, get it started. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  So I think we shouldn't be really surprised if the ceasefire breaks down sooner than we [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=179.02s)]
*  can see right now. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=185.66000000000003s)]
*  So, Pankaj, if you could, let's, you know, go to your book, The World After Gaza, A History, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=188.26s)]
*  and talk about this assault on Gaza in the context of the history that you lay out. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=195.3s)]
*  As we said in our introduction, you write in the prologue to the book, quote, that you [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=200.62s)]
*  felt almost compelled to write this book to alleviate my demoralizing perplexity before [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=206.04s)]
*  an extensive moral breakdown. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=211.3s)]
*  Explain why you wrote that book and how you see the present situation in the context of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=214.66s)]
*  the history that you lay out. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=218.66s)]
*  Well, you know, I think the primary impulse behind the book was really to put an end to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=220.42000000000002s)]
*  this horrible loneliness that I felt, along with many other people, a kind of desolation [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=227.42000000000002s)]
*  induced by the fact that, you know, powerful people, powerful politicians in democracies, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=236.74s)]
*  intellectuals, were either silent about the, you know, ongoing genocide in Gaza or, even [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=242.3s)]
*  worse, vehemently supporting it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=251.54000000000002s)]
*  So I think, you know, it forced many of us to reexamine, you know, not just sort of narratives [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=254.54000000000002s)]
*  of Middle Eastern history or Israeli history or Palestinian history, but a kind of broader [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=262.1s)]
*  history of Western supremacism, of decolonization. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=268.98s)]
*  You know, we also saw a massive global divide open up in the responses to the atrocities [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  in Gaza, with South Africa, a country like South Africa, taking the lead in bringing [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=280.18s)]
*  a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=285.1s)]
*  And, of course, we can now see South Africa as being severely punished by Trump and Musk [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=288.82s)]
*  for daring to do this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=294.66s)]
*  We saw public opinion in most of the world really shocked and appalled by the disproportionate [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=297.06s)]
*  Israeli response, and at the same time, you know, that public opinion asking questions, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=305.62s)]
*  you know, of Western democracies, like, what happened here? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=311.94s)]
*  Why are you supporting this endless massacre of thousands and thousands of people? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=315.38s)]
*  So, you know, in a very sort of—I think I would say that I find myself in the situation [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=320.46s)]
*  of a lot of people who were completely bewildered by the Israeli response to October 7. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=325.82s)]
*  And, you know, at least I have this option of turning my anguish or turning my bewilderment [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=333.9s)]
*  into, you know, some way of trying to understand this through writing, through prose. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=341.9s)]
*  But you know, it remains a baffling episode, and of course we are now entering the most [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=348.86s)]
*  intense part of it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=354.78000000000003s)]
*  You know, you just described whether it's Ukraine, just been listening to this program [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=355.98s)]
*  now for 45 minutes, and this, you know, vast panorama of violence, disorder and suffering [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=360.74s)]
*  that we're seeing today. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=369.26s)]
*  And I think it's really important not just to think about the past or the history, the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=370.54s)]
*  larger history of what is happening in Gaza today, but also about the present. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=376.46000000000004s)]
*  And that is also something I describe in the book, whether Gaza signifies something more [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=380.53999999999996s)]
*  than just the latest episode in a longstanding conflict in the Middle East. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=387.06s)]
*  Does it portend the, you know, arrival of far-right racial supremacist regimes across [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=393.28s)]
*  the Western world? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=401.53999999999996s)]
*  So I would—you know, I would argue, and I have said this in the book, that we are [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=403.17999999999995s)]
*  looking at a far more extensive moral, political and, I would say, intellectual breakdown than [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=406.74s)]
*  we have known, certainly in our own lifetimes. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=415.74s)]
*  And that, perhaps, Pankaj, explains the title of your book, The World After Gaza, which [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=418.42s)]
*  suggests that there is, in your view, some kind of rupture, that the world is somehow [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=423.86s)]
*  substantively different. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  It will be different after this assault on Gaza ends, in the event that it does and what [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=431.62s)]
*  form it takes. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=437.74s)]
*  So if you could say something about that, and then also the point that you made earlier [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=439.66s)]
*  about decolonization. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=444.3s)]
*  It's a theme that runs throughout the book, in which you say correctly, I think, that [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=445.3s)]
*  the seminal event of the 20th century for the vast majority of the peoples of the world [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=452.94s)]
*  was decolonization. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=458.14s)]
*  Why is that significant, when we look at what's happened in Gaza and the response to it? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=460.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, I think, very simply, decolonization was not just a political event. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=466.38000000000005s)]
*  It was not just, you know, a whole lot of nation-states in Asia and Africa becoming [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=472.74s)]
*  sovereign, becoming liberated from their European masters. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=477.06s)]
*  It was also a profound emotional and psychological moment of liberation. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=481.36s)]
*  I think, you know, from the 19th century onwards, the world was knit together by a very explicitly [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=486.62s)]
*  racial mode of imperialism and capitalism. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=493.97999999999996s)]
*  And I think, you know, some of the best people in Asia and Africa fought against this global [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=497.65999999999997s)]
*  regime and finally won, starting the mid-20th century, and created these nation-states that, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=503.06s)]
*  you know, exist all across Asia and Africa, and are becoming both politically, economically [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=510.66s)]
*  and geopolitically more assertive. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=517.7s)]
*  And there's also, you know, a mental revolution also going on, has been going on for several [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=520.4s)]
*  decades. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=525.22s)]
*  So, I think, for many people in the West who have been absorbed with a very different narrative, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=526.22s)]
*  first of all, the narrative of the Cold War, the narrative of the end of history, the narrative [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=533.26s)]
*  of American unipolar dominance, decolonization still comes as a kind of news, or they confuse [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=539.74s)]
*  it with people asking for decolonizing, you know, knowledge in the United States or decolonizing [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=548.4599999999999s)]
*  educational syllabuses. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=557.5799999999999s)]
*  So I think there's a very broad confusion about this world, but what it really signifies [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=558.9s)]
*  is greater political, intellectual assertiveness and a very fierce desire to not live in a [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=565.7s)]
*  world where racial privilege, most specifically white privilege, orders and forces a global [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=574.58s)]
*  hierarchy. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=582.4200000000001s)]
*  You know, you can see this very clearly in sort of South African presidents a few days [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=583.4200000000001s)]
*  ago making a speech and saying, we will not be bullied, you know, Trump is imposing very [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=587.98s)]
*  severe sort of measures against the country. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=594.02s)]
*  And there they are standing and saying, we're going to push back. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=598.74s)]
*  And likewise, I think you will find that kind of resistance in different parts of the world. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=602.26s)]
*  And of course, you know, what happened in Gaza, which shocked, appalled people, you [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=606.5s)]
*  know, from Indonesia to Brazil. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=612.86s)]
*  That is also something, you know, that can really only be explained, this global divide. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=615.98s)]
*  If you think about decolonization creating a new subjectivity, a new mentality, a new [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=620.3s)]
*  way of looking at the world. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=625.54s)]
*  And Pankaj, maybe President Trump understands this very well, as he repeated his claim that [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=627.54s)]
*  the U.S. is preparing to take control of Gaza, own it while permanently displacing the territory's [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=635.74s)]
*  entire population of 2 million Palestinians. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=641.8199999999999s)]
*  I wanted to just play that short clip of him sitting next to Jordan's King Abdullah [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=644.82s)]
*  for talks on Gaza at the White House on Tuesday. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=650.46s)]
*  We're going to have Gaza. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=653.0600000000001s)]
*  We don't have to buy it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=655.0600000000001s)]
*  There's nothing to buy. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=656.0600000000001s)]
*  We will have Gaza. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=658.7s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=659.7s)]
*  No reason to buy. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=660.7s)]
*  There is nothing to buy. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=661.7s)]
*  It's Gaza. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=663.1s)]
*  It's a war-torn area. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=664.1s)]
*  We're going to take it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=665.9000000000001s)]
*  So there you have President Trump saying not just, we're going to buy it, we're going [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=667.62s)]
*  to own it, we're going to have it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=671.4200000000001s)]
*  Again, trying to push back on this whole trend, this whole move in the 20th century of decolonization. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=674.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, this is the strangest thing, really, you know, that the United States is [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=682.74s)]
*  going back—and that is part of the Great American Unraveling—it's going back to [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=690.4200000000001s)]
*  a 19th century model of rapacious imperialism that's interested in territory, that is [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=696.46s)]
*  grabbing resources wherever they can find it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=703.6600000000001s)]
*  And this Ukraine deal you were just talking about, that is now so much about resources [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=706.3000000000001s)]
*  that Trump has eyed in Ukraine. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=711.3000000000001s)]
*  So I think, you know, this is something that people have been talking about for a very [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=715.26s)]
*  long time, that the structures and mentalities of racial imperialism in the 19th century [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=720.02s)]
*  are very much alive. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=725.56s)]
*  People like that were dismissed as woke, as politically correct. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=726.88s)]
*  But we are now seeing a kind of real-time, live verification of those insights into the [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=731.36s)]
*  nature of the modern world. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=737.72s)]
*  And you know, what Trump is saying today is bringing a very refreshing kind of clarity. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=739.4399999999999s)]
*  We can see how this wealth, how this great power was slowly accumulated and how people [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=745.36s)]
*  fearing the loss of that power, because China is rising, China is becoming dominant, you [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=752.1999999999999s)]
*  have the most powerful people in the world resorting to the most naked form of expansion, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=757.16s)]
*  the most naked forms of appropriation. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=764.8s)]
*  Before we go, Pankaj, if you could just comment on the meeting of Modi with Trump today at [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=767.68s)]
*  the White House, and then we'll do an extended conversation. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=772.6s)]
*  Well, you know, I think we've seen very recently, just in the last few days, you know, a kind [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=777.16s)]
*  of endless parade of heads of state. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=783.92s)]
*  Jordan, you just mentioned, the Japanese prime minister was just there. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=787.24s)]
*  People really trying to appease a bully, the chief bully, and hoping that they will get [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=791.56s)]
*  something out of him that they can go back and share with their people. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=798.56s)]
*  I think Modi is in a particularly difficult situation. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=802.24s)]
*  I don't know if your viewers know. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=804.4399999999999s)]
*  There were images all across India, India of, you know, of Indian migrants being deported [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=806.76s)]
*  from the United States, shackled and chained. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=812.0s)]
*  It created a lot of shock. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=816.24s)]
*  And Modi has to now go back and tell people that India's dignity is intact, which is [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=817.36s)]
*  a great tall order right now. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=822.4000000000001s)]
*  Pankaj Mishra, award-winning Indian author, essayist, his new book, The World After Gaza, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=824.1600000000001s)]
*  a History. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=830.1600000000001s)]
*  We'll do Part 2 and post it online at democracynow.org. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=831.1600000000001s)]
*  Happy birthday to Brendan Allen. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=835.56s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Nermeen Shaikh. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9cg_V-N_g&t=837.0799999999999s)]
