# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” June 21, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [June 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SCYaqju-9M)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  As Israel's unrelenting assault on Gaza stretches into its ninth month, experts are
*  warning of the compounding effects of the war on children.
*  Children represent some 16,000 of the more than 37,000 Palestinians killed by Israel
*  since October 7th.
*  They're also some of the most vulnerable to disease and the worsening hunger crisis,
*  with thousands malnourished and facing death.
*  Another 17,000 children have lost one or both parents.
*  Meanwhile, over 600,000 Palestinian students have been out of school for more than eight
*  months.
*  Schools that have been turned into shelters for displaced Gazans have been regularly destroyed
*  by Israel, including an UNRWA building in Khan Yunis, which was hit by an Israeli airstrike
*  on Thursday.
*  There was a house next to us.
*  They wanted to strike, and as you can see, the classroom where we shelter is damaged.
*  I don't know where we will sleep.
*  We are 25 people in this classroom.
*  Look how it's damaged in our sleeping area.
*  Where will we sleep?
*  We don't know.
*  We will have to sleep in the yard.
*  In related news, the first Palestinian athlete to ever participate in the Olympics died last
*  week in Gaza's Nusrah refugee camp after he was unable to receive medical care for
*  kidney failure.
*  Majed Abu Marakhil, a long-distance runner, represented Palestine in the 1996 Olympics
*  in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was the flag bearer.
*  The United Nations Environment Program warns Israel's war on the Gaza Strip has spawned
*  an unprecedented environmental crisis, with worsening soil, water and air pollution and
*  risks of irreversible damage to Gaza's natural ecosystems.
*  In a new report, the U.N. finds Israeli attacks have generated 39 million tons of debris,
*  with severe damage to Gaza's water, sanitation and hygiene systems, the destruction of solar
*  panels and the dispersal of heavy metals and explosive chemicals.
*  This is Fatima Al-Shanbari, a displaced Palestinian whose family is sheltering in Jabalia.
*  FATIMA AL-SHANBARI, Palestinian
*  The international women's media foundation is under fire for rescinding its courage in
*  journalism award to the Gaza-based Palestinian journalist Mahouz Saini, following a smear
*  campaign by pro-Israel groups and false accusations of anti-Semitism.
*  Mahouz Saini responded in an op-ed published in the Middle East Eye, quote,
*  Winning a prize for courage means being subjected to attacks and choosing to continue your work
*  regardless.
*  Regrettably, the very organization that recognized these perilous conditions and awarded me the
*  prize chose to be uncourageous, she said.
*  Wikipedia has declared the Anti-Defamation League a generally unreliable source on the
*  Israel-Palestine conflict and a major PR blow for the pro-Israel group.
*  The majority of Wikipedia editors found the ADL to be heavily biased against Palestinian
*  rights.
*  The label puts the ADL in the same category as Fox News and Amazon Reviews, among other
*  unreliable sources.
*  Editors are also considering applying the unreliable designation to the ADL in relation
*  to anti-Semitism.
*  With New York's primary election just four days away, a super PAC affiliated with the
*  American Israel Public Affairs Committee, APAC, is spending roughly $17,000 an hour
*  to defeat progressive Congress member Jamal Bowman, who's spoken out against Israel's
*  war on Gaza.
*  That amounts to $14.5 million spent by APAC in around a month, making it by far the most
*  money ever poured in to a House primary race by any interest group.
*  In other election news, Donald Trump has proposed granting green cards to foreign nationals
*  who graduate from U.S. colleges in a major departure from his usual anti-immigrant rhetoric.
*  Trump made the remarks after being asked in a podcast about staffing U.S. companies.
*  Following the comments, Trump's team issued a statement reassuring his supporters that
*  he still plans to impose the most aggressive immigration policies in U.S. history, quote,
*  communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters and public charges, he said.
*  A new study finds global heating from human activity made this year's late spring heat
*  wave in the U.S., Mexico and Central America 35 times more likely to happen.
*  Meanwhile, scorching summer heat is compounding the suffering of asylum seekers at the U.S.
*  southern border.
*  The Sunland Park Fire Department near El Paso, Texas, has recorded the deaths of at least
*  13 people in the desert so far this year.
*  This is Fire Chief Ramiro Morios.
*  Hawaii has reached a legal settlement with a group of youth climate activists who sued
*  the state over its greenhouse gas emissions.
*  Under the legally binding agreement announced by Governor Josh Green, Hawaii agrees to
*  fully decarbonize its transportation systems to achieve zero emissions no later than 2045.
*  Meanwhile, Britain's highest court has ruled government planners fail to consider the harmful
*  effects of global heating when they approved a new oil well near London's Gatwick Airport.
*  It's a major victory for environmentalists and a setback for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak,
*  who's pledged to max out the U.K.'s oil and gas reserves.
*  Climate campaigner Sarah Finch led the legal fight against the oil well.
*  In the climate side, we hear a lot about tipping points, Amazon deforestation, melting permafrost,
*  things that accelerate global warming in an unpredictable, frightening way.
*  I think today we've just seen a tipping point in the other direction.
*  No longer will any environmental authority be allowed to wade through fossil fuel production
*  without fully considering the climate impact.
*  The U.S. Supreme Court upheld a Trump-era tax on overseas investments.
*  The case stemmed from a challenge to the mandatory repatriation tax by a couple who sought to
*  avoid paying a one-time $15,000 tax levy related to an investment in an India-based company.
*  Senator Elizabeth Warren welcomed the decision, saying, quote,
*  Right-wing billionaires hoped an obscure legal case would blow up the tax code to avoid paying
*  what they owe, but this effort failed, she said.
*  Analysts warned the ruling, however, does not resolve the constitutionality of wealth
*  taxes, and billionaires could challenge future laws requiring them to pay their taxes.
*  Vladimir Putin met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in Hanoi Thursday
*  with the two nations pledging closer cooperation on energy and security.
*  Meanwhile, South Korea summoned Russia's ambassador and said it will consider supplying weapons to Ukraine
*  after Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un signed a mutual defense pact this week.
*  Speaking from Hanoi, Putin said Moscow is considering lowering the threshold for use of
*  nuclear weapons and supplying arms to Pyongyang.
*  We've reserved the right to supply weapons to other regions of the world.
*  Bearing in mind our agreements with the Korean People's Democratic Republic, I don't exclude that either.
*  And the acclaimed actor and lifelong activist Donald Sutherland has died at the age of 88.
*  During the Vietnam War, Sutherland, Jane Fonda and others formed an anti-war road show called the FTA,
*  or Free the Army.
*  Modeled after Bob Hope's USO tour, the group traveled to perform for soldiers who came out against the war.
*  In 2017, declassified documents showed Sutherland was on the National Security Agency's watch list
*  between 71 and 1973.
*  On the big screen, Sutherland was known for his scene-stealing roles in JFK, The Hunger Games,
*  Don't Look Now, Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Pride and Prejudice, among others.
*  Donald Sutherland has five children, including the actor Kiefer Sutherland.
*  Kiefer Sutherland's maternal grandfather, Tommy Douglas, is considered the father of Canada's single-payer health care system.
