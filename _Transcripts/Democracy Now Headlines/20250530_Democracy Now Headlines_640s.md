President Donald Trump has vowed to go to the Supreme Court to keep his tariffs in place after a whirlwind 24 hours that saw a court temporarily reinstate the measures, soon after two courts blocked most of the tariffs, saying Trump overstepped his presidential authority. Trump has been infuriated by the legal challenges and lashed out on social media against the Federalist Society and conservative legal activist Leonard Leo. We get an update from Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice and an expert on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act that Trump has invoked to justify his global tariffs. She says the fate of Trump's tariffs remains uncertain, given that the powers available under the IEEPA "have to be used to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States, and they cannot be used for any other reason."

# As Courts Battle Trump on Tariffs, Will Right-Wing Supreme Court Rescue President’s Trade Agenda?

*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=10.84s)]
*  We turn now to Trump's sweeping global tariffs. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=11.84s)]
*  After a whirlwind 24 hours that saw a federal appeals court Thursday temporarily reinstate [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=15.4s)]
*  the tariffs, just a day after the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked most of the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=21.6s)]
*  tariffs, arguing Trump overstepped his presidential authority by invoking emergency powers. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=26.24s)]
*  Prior to Thursday's appeals court order reinstating for a few minutes these tariffs, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=32.36s)]
*  a federal court in Washington, D.C., also blocked Trump's tariffs, though that ruling [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=39.08s)]
*  won't go into effect for another two weeks. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=43.959999999999994s)]
*  The Trump administration has vowed to bring the legal fight to the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  In its ruling, the New York-based Court of International Trade said the U.S. Constitution [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=51.06s)]
*  gave Congress exclusive powers to regulate trade with other nations and that a 1977 law [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=56.14s)]
*  cited by Trump to invoke the tariffs, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=61.900000000000006s)]
*  did not give him the authority to levy the sweeping import taxes. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=67.58s)]
*  President Trump denounced the attempts by the courts to block his tariffs in a lengthy [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=72.66s)]
*  a truth social rant Thursday night that also targeted Leonard Leo, who, as a top member [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=77.92s)]
*  of the Conservative Federalist Society, played a vital role in influencing Trump's judicial [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=85.64s)]
*  picks during his first term, including the selection of three far-right Supreme Court [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=90.64s)]
*  justices. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=94.88s)]
*  Trump wrote, quote, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=96.36s)]
*  "'Hopefully, the Supreme Court will reverse this horrible, country-threatening decision [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=97.36s)]
*  decisively. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=104.08s)]
*  Backroom hustlers must not be allowed to destroy our nation.'" [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=105.08s)]
*  I was new, Trump went on to say, to Washington, and it was suggested that I use the Federalist [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  Society as a recommending source on judges. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  I did so openly and freely, but then realized that they were under the thumb of a real sleazebag [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=117.12s)]
*  named Leonard Leo, a bad person who in his own way probably hates America and obviously [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=121.56s)]
*  has his own separate ambitions. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=126.42s)]
*  Trump went on to say, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=128.56s)]
*  I'm disappointed in the Federalist Society because of the bad advice they gave me on [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=130.56s)]
*  numerous judicial nominations. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=132.72s)]
*  This is something that cannot be forgotten, Trump wrote on social media and truth social. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  For more, we go to Washington, D.C., where we're joined by Elizabeth Goitin, co-director [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=139.76s)]
*  of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, expert [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=144.94s)]
*  on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the law Trump has invoked to justify [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=149.08s)]
*  his global tariffs. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=154.16s)]
*  Welcome back to Democracy Now!, Elizabeth. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=156.08s)]
*  OK, if you can respond to everything. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  First, explain what this court is that overturned the tariffs, said you can't use this law, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=160.0s)]
*  and then even who Leonard Leo and the Federalist Society, who many may be shocked that Trump [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=166.52s)]
*  has turned on, given he helped choose three of the Trump appointees who were confirmed [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  to the Supreme Court. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=183.56s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=185.32s)]
*  So, there are actually two courts that have now rejected Trump's attempt to use emergency [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=186.32s)]
*  powers to essentially bypass Congress and impose worldwide tariffs. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  One of those courts is a regular federal district court here in Washington, D.C., and another [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=198.6s)]
*  court is called the Court of International Trade, which is a specialized federal court [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=203.4s)]
*  that hears challenges to laws involving trade or customs. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=208.72s)]
*  The Court of International Trade heard the case with a three-judge panel. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=214.83999999999997s)]
*  So we now have had four different judges, two of whom were appointed by Republican presidents, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  including one Trump appointee, and two of whom were appointed by a Democratic president. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=226.88s)]
*  And all of them—so the Court of International Trade panel was unanimous—held that Trump [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=232.0s)]
*  the authority provided to him under law by imposing these tariffs. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=239.52s)]
*  And so go more deeply into this 1977 law and what it means to invoke an emergency. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=256.32s)]
*  The law is called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or AIIPA, and it is one [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=258.32s)]
*  of the 150 laws that become available when the president declares a national emergency. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=265.28s)]
*  AIIPA requires the president not only to declare a national emergency, but also the powers [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=273.11999999999995s)]
*  that are available under AIIPA have to be used to deal with an unusual and extraordinary [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=280.08s)]
*  threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, and they [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=287.2s)]
*  cannot be used for any other reason. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=294.16s)]
*  AIIPA has historically been used to impose economic sanctions against hostile foreign [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=297.12s)]
*  actors. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=303.76000000000005s)]
*  It forms the basis for dozens of existing sanctions regimes, including our sanctions [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=305.04s)]
*  against Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, et cetera. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  But it has never previously been used to impose tariffs. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  That is because while AIIPA includes a long list of powers that the president can exercise, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=322.64000000000004s)]
*  that list does not include the words tariffs, taxes, or duties. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=329.12s)]
*  So the government is instead arguing that language in AIIPA that allows the president [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  to regulate economic transactions, including imports and exports, should be read to sort [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=341.68s)]
*  of impliedly authorize tariffs against every country in the world. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=349.28s)]
*  And that is what the courts rejected. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=354.96s)]
*  The three-judge panel of the trade court also blocked a separate set of tariffs against [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=357.84s)]
*  China, Mexico, and Canada, which the Trump administration had imposed over what it claimed [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=363.2s)]
*  was a flow of illicit drugs and undocumented immigrants into the United States. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=367.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=373.52s)]
*  And there was actually a separate reasoning for blocking those tariffs. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=373.84s)]
*  So when it came to the worldwide tariffs, essentially what the court said is that the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=379.04s)]
*  government was claiming unlimited power to impose whatever tariffs that the president [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  thought would be appropriate, and that that was such a massive sort of takeover of the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  powers that the Constitution gives to Congress. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=400.16s)]
*  So Congress, under Article 1, has the authority—in fact, it's the first power listed under [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=402.64000000000004s)]
*  Congress's powers—to impose tariffs. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=408.64s)]
*  And if you read AIIPA to allow the president to make up his own mind about what tariffs [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=410.96s)]
*  should be imposed on what countries, that would be unconstitutionally transferring [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  Congress's power to the president. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=420.0s)]
*  The fentanyl tariffs that you mentioned against China, Mexico, and Canada were more limited. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=422.32s)]
*  And so there was a different argument that was made in that case. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=429.76s)]
*  What the plaintiffs argued was that under AIIPA, the powers have to be exercised to deal with [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=434.4s)]
*  an unusual or extraordinary threat, and that the tariffs in this case were such a total mismatch [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  to the threat that had been identified, the threats of fentanyl trafficking and human [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=448.23999999999995s)]
*  trafficking and illegal immigration, that it just didn't meet the criteria for AIIPA. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=452.08s)]
*  So— [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=456.79999999999995s)]
*  Now, in this case— [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=456.96s)]
*  I'm going to interrupt you. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=457.84s)]
*  Go ahead. Go ahead. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=459.67999999999995s)]
*  Okay. Well, this is really important, which is why I'm not letting you interrupt me. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=460.4s)]
*  What the government argued in this case was that no court can question the president's decision [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=465.35999999999996s)]
*  that his actions under AIIPA are dealing with an unusual and extraordinary threat. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=473.44s)]
*  And the Court of International Trade rejected this claim entirely. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=478.79999999999995s)]
*  The court said that these criteria in the statute are clear and that the courts are [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=483.28s)]
*  capable of interpreting and applying them, and that the supremacy of the law requires, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=489.12s)]
*  that courts must be able to intervene when a president acts outside of the law. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=495.76000000000005s)]
*  So that was a very important part of the ruling that will have salience far beyond [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=502.32000000000005s)]
*  this immediate case. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  So you have Trump officials calling this a judicial coup. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=508.48s)]
*  They're going to take it to the Supreme Court. What do you see happening? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=513.44s)]
*  Well, I think it might take a little while, because there are several other lawsuits pending [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=518.88s)]
*  across the country on the tariffs, and there will be decisions in the lower courts, and then they [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=525.04s)]
*  will go up to the appellate courts. The appellate courts will have their chance to rule. Yes, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  this is headed towards the Supreme Court in the next term for the Supreme Court. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=534.4s)]
*  And I don't think anyone can predict exactly what will happen. But I will point out that one of the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=539.68s)]
*  arguments that—or one of the reasons that the Court of International Trade gave for holding that [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=546.72s)]
*  IEPA does not authorize tariffs was because such a reading of IEPA would violate the major questions [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=554.72s)]
*  doctrine, and that is a doctrine that the Supreme Court has really embraced in these last few years. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=561.9200000000001s)]
*  Under this doctrine, any executive branch action—executive branch actions that have [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=569.92s)]
*  major political or economic significance must be clearly authorized by Congress. It has to be [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=576.8000000000001s)]
*  explicit. It cannot be a vague or ambiguous provision that is being interpreted to grant that [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=584.4s)]
*  power. That is certainly the case with the government's interpretation of IEPA. So there's [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nX_VwsYeDs&t=590.32s)]
