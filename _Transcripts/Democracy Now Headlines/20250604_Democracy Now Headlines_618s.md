Officials in Gaza say over 100 Palestinians have been killed during recent Israeli attacks on people waiting at aid sites. An additional 500 are wounded. Following the series of deadly attacks, the shadowy U.S.-Israeli humanitarian aid operation is shutting down for a day, and Israel's military warned Palestinians that roads leading to the aid distribution centers will be considered "combat zones." The United Nations has called for a prompt and impartial investigation into each of the attacks. The U.S.-Israeli aid system is "more about the humiliation and the control of the people" than feeding Palestinians, says Mahmoud Alsaqqa, Oxfam's food security and livelihoods coordinator in Gaza, who joins us from Gaza City.

*  Welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  In a moment, we're going to be going to the ship that's trying to make its way to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=113.1s)]

*  We'll be speaking with the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=119.61999999999999s)]
*  But can you, Mahmoud, tell us what's happening on the ground and the latest with this closing [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=123.66s)]
*  of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, set up by Israel, backed by the U.S., that took over [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=129.14s)]
*  What? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=139.06s)]
*  Three or four sites it built them instead of the 400 that were on the ground around [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=140.06s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=144.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=145.32s)]
*  Thank you for having me again. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=146.32s)]
*  In fact, the situation on the ground is extremely chaotic. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=149.32s)]
*  And it's as we have learned before about this, especially with this aid distribution [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=155.06s)]
*  mechanism. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=162.78s)]
*  In fact, what is happening in this inhumanitized distribution voice is more about the humiliation [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=163.94s)]
*  and control of the people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=170.26s)]
*  We are seeing the people, thousands of people are standing from the early hours in the morning [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=172.38s)]
*  to secure something to their starving children. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=178.1s)]
*  And in such cases, it's rare even to get actually the supplies. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=182.06s)]
*  And now they are facing the issue of returning home alive. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=187.14s)]
*  So we are we are considering this points as a death traps and we are seeing shooting [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=191.58s)]
*  of starving people near to this sites, especially what's happened in Rapa has as very report [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  in death. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  It's horrifying. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=204.70000000000002s)]
*  And and many people have lost their lives in these sites. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=205.70000000000002s)]
*  So these sites are controlled by by private actors. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=209.88000000000002s)]
*  It's located in a military zones in a military conflict areas. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=214.54000000000002s)]
*  They didn't even consider any any things related to that to the human beings and dignity. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  And what was exposed, expected to have from these sites is contradicts again and nothing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  achieved in terms of addressing the high and the overwhelming needs of the people here [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=233.82s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=240.48s)]
*  And Mahmoud, the the other organizations, aid organizations that have been on the ground [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=243.04s)]
*  since this conflict began. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=248.32s)]
*  Has the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had any kind of communication or coordination with [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=251.4s)]
*  the existing groups? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=257.28s)]
*  No, you know, our our our position from the first that we were against such a mechanism [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=260.24s)]
*  because we have the system on a place. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=266.12s)]
*  We have the system of the UN and the international NGO that exists in a place and which has [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=269.0s)]
*  proven its effectiveness since the 19 months and even the improvement was noticed during [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=274.76000000000005s)]
*  the ceasefire period where we able to reach more and more vulnerable people. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  And this is vulnerable people who are not accessing even this distribute the new GF [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=287.16s)]
*  GHO distribution points. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=292.16s)]
*  And we have this amount of sectoral assistance. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=294.72s)]
*  What we are having now in this distribution points is just food and the people in need [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=297.56s)]
*  for a multi sectoral assistance that we were even and we were trying to provide this, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=302.06s)]
*  including the medical supplies, the clean water, shifters, materials and all these things. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=307.58000000000004s)]
*  And it's these things are now ignored within this this mechanisms. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=313.02000000000004s)]
*  And we are trying all the time to abide to the international humanitarian law and preserving [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=317.70000000000005s)]
*  the dignity of those people, which is this mechanism are strips the people of dignity. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=322.98s)]
*  And this is why we are seeing all this humiliation of the people. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=328.09999999999997s)]
*  In summary, this this mechanism is dehumanizing the people. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=331.82s)]
*  And it's it's really dangerous. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=337.58s)]
*  People are losing their lives there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=339.5s)]
*  And it's it's ineffective in reaching the people, especially the vulnerable people. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=341.53999999999996s)]
*  And we have our our mechanism in a place and active. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=346.21999999999997s)]
*  So there is no need even for this mechanism at all. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=350.62s)]
*  And is Israel allowing any supplies in for the existing mechanism of aid groups in Gaza? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=354.98s)]
*  Yeah, as you know, after after the international community pressure on Israel, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=364.7s)]
*  after 12 weeks of of a full blockade in the 21st of March, they allowed a trickle of aid to come in. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=369.58s)]
*  But but it still have this over control on this is that are coming. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=379.70000000000005s)]
*  And it's it's a very limited quantities that are coming. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=385.42s)]
*  And even it's limited for food supplies and some nutrition items where the need is much more than this. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=389.70000000000005s)]
*  In average, what we are receiving in Gaza, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=397.70000000000005s)]
*  right now in this mechanism is around 50 trucks, 60 trucks or even less more. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=400.3s)]
*  But but nothing compared to what we should have. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=406.78s)]
*  And it's not addressing the huge needs of the people here in Gaza Strip. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=410.9s)]
*  So even with this mechanism, we are still seeing this happening and the people are starving. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=414.94s)]
*  And this is the question that where is the problem? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=420.42s)]
*  The problem is with this mechanism that it's not efficient or effective. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=422.82s)]
*  We need to have a smooth supply of that of the aid in order to be able to provide the services. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=427.3s)]
*  And we succeeded in doing so in a brief period of time. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=433.46000000000004s)]
*  The UN Children's Fund, UNICEF, has reported that the number of Gaza's children killed or injured by Israel since October 2023 has surpassed 50,000. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=439.38000000000005s)]
*  In a statement, UNICEF wrote, How many more dead girls and boys will it take? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=454.66s)]
*  What level of horror must be live streamed before the international community fully steps up, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=459.18s)]
*  uses its influence and takes bold, decisive action to force the end of this ruthless killing of children? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=465.22s)]
*  As we speak, people in London are forming a red line. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=473.62s)]
*  They are holding red banners fully around the British Parliament. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=479.46s)]
*  While Britain and France and Canada have said they're going to crack down on relations with Israel, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=483.42s)]
*  these people are demanding that they stop arming Israel. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=490.06s)]
*  Can you talk about what's happening with the children on the ground at this point? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=494.86s)]
*  Yeah, the situation is deteriorating over time, especially with the vulnerable groups, including the children. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=501.54s)]
*  And according to the last food security and nutrition report, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=508.53999999999996s)]
*  that we are expecting more worsening in the health of children who are more affected by this shortages of all supplies in the Gaza Strip. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=512.1s)]
*  And this is increasing because we are seeing more displacement orders are in place, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=524.9s)]
*  more intensifying of the military operations and more displacement for the people to crowded places. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=529.94s)]
*  So we are seeing the outbreak of diseases and the public health is deteriorating and the health sector is collapsing. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=539.1400000000001s)]
*  So we are expecting worse for the vulnerable groups, including the children. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=550.34s)]
*  So this is why we have to save lives. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=555.1400000000001s)]
*  We must go back to our work, reopening all the crossings and lift the movement and the few restrictions for the people. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=557.54s)]
*  And what we are seeing around the world nowadays, it's really important and should be continued in order to hold Israel accountable to what they are doing right now. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=564.86s)]
*  And also to reach this permanency fire. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=577.2199999999999s)]
*  Nowadays, we are talking about permanency fire. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=581.06s)]
*  We do not need the Boz to have such a few days and return back to the same same area. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=584.06s)]
*  We need a permanency fire so the people can breathe again and at least to have to have to be able to recover from all these things that they are encountering and facing right now. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=591.14s)]
*  Mahmoud El-Sakha, I want to thank you so much for being with us, Oxfam's Food Security and Livelihoods Coordinator, speaking to us from Gaza. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BiTTzeszuI&t=603.06s)]
