A federal judge has blocked the deportation of recent Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent legal resident of the U.S. who was arrested by immigration authorities for helping organize campus solidarity protests with Gaza. He had been receiving daily threats stemming from an online smear campaign launched by pro-Israel activists before his arrest and repeatedly appealed to university administrators for protection. Khalil, who is a Palestinian green card holder, is married to a U.S. citizen. Upon his arrest, he was separated from his pregnant wife and transported to a detention facility in Louisiana, where legal experts say he is more likely to appear before Trump-friendly judges if his case moves forward. “Her husband was abducted before her very eyes [and] disappeared,” says Ramzi Kassem.

*  They had every reason to look forward to that momentous event. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=476.44s)]
*  And they're coming home on a Saturday night around 8 p.m. as they're about to enter their [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=480.68s)]
*  buildings when they're approached by men in plain clothes who subsequently identify themselves [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=485.44s)]
*  as DHS agents. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=490.52s)]
*  And what they say is that they're going to take Mahmoud away because his student visa [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=492.4s)]
*  has been revoked. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=496.52s)]
*  His wife protested and said that he doesn't have a student visa. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=498.28s)]
*  He's a permanent resident. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=501.44s)]
*  He has a green card. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=502.44s)]
*  She goes upstairs to their apartment, gets the green card, shows it to the agent. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=504.12s)]
*  The agent seems confused, calls his superiors, who apparently ordered him to take Mahmoud [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=507.6s)]
*  anyway. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=512.84s)]
*  And so from her perspective, understandably, her husband was abducted before her very eyes [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=513.84s)]
*  disappeared to a location in downtown Manhattan. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=519.4s)]
*  And later that evening, our colleagues and co-counsel Amy Greer and Kyle Barron filed [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=524.04s)]
*  a habeas corpus petition in federal court in Manhattan on his behalf asking for him [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=531.8000000000001s)]
*  to be released. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=535.52s)]
*  And what the government did within hours of that is to move him a thousand miles away [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=536.52s)]
*  from that courthouse down to Louisiana to complicate, interfere with his access to the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=540.64s)]
*  court, with his access to his legal team, with his access to his wife and his family [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=546.72s)]
*  and his support network. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=551.12s)]
*  So what we ended up having to do yesterday, unfortunately, is filing a motion with that [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=553.28s)]
*  same court asking basically for the court to order the government to return Mahmoud [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=559.84s)]
*  to New York so that he can have access to his legal team, so that he can have access [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=565.36s)]
*  to the court and so that the court can vindicate his constitutional rights. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=569.44s)]
*  The court has already issued an order yesterday scheduling a hearing for Wednesday and also [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=573.8000000000001s)]
*  barring the government from deporting Mahmoud until the court orders otherwise. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=580.2800000000001s)]
*  But Ramzi, if he is a permanent resident and he's not, hasn't been accused of any lawful [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=588.36s)]
*  violation, what basis do they have, if any, to actually try to revoke his greeting card? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=595.5200000000001s)]
*  That is the key question, Juan. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=604.9200000000001s)]
*  Our contention is that this is all retaliatory. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=606.32s)]
*  The reason he was arrested and detained and targeted for arrest and detention was his [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=609.24s)]
*  constitutionally protected, First Amendment protected speech and activism in support of [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=614.56s)]
*  Palestinian lives and rights in Gaza and beyond. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  And the fact that he played as your segment highlighted a key mediation role between the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=622.56s)]
*  university administration and student protesters, which if anything is laudable, it's commendable. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  It's what you would want any student to do. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=631.52s)]
*  So none of that is criminal. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=633.92s)]
*  The government hasn't even contended really seriously that there is any kind of criminal [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=635.8s)]
*  activity. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=639.52s)]
*  There's never been an arrest or a conviction that they could point to. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=640.52s)]
*  As far as we could tell, the government is invoking, and this is a somewhat novel approach, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=643.04s)]
*  they're invoking the foreign policy grounds where the secretary of state is basically [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  saying that this person who is a non-citizen, who is a permanent resident, by his mere presence [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=654.28s)]
*  or activities in the United States, poses a threat to U.S. foreign policy interests. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=661.02s)]
*  Now, none of that has been detailed or specified. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=666.36s)]
*  And frankly, we don't believe it'll fly in court because that provision of law may exist, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=669.72s)]
*  but it does not exist to punish constitutionally protected speech. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=675.08s)]
*  In other words, it doesn't trump Mr. Khalil's First Amendment rights. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=678.5600000000001s)]
*  And when you hear, for instance, that President Trump on Truth Social said, quote, we know [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=684.64s)]
*  there are more students at Columbia and other universities across the country who've engaged [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=690.4s)]
*  in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump administration will [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=696.32s)]
*  not tolerate it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=701.08s)]
*  What does this tell you about where we're heading? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=702.86s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, we've all, sadly, become accustomed to the sort of inflammatory and [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=704.7600000000001s)]
*  frankly racist rhetoric that emanates from the Trump administration. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=711.5600000000001s)]
*  This is no different. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=715.0s)]
*  When it comes to Mahmoud, it's all entirely baseless. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=716.1600000000001s)]
*  And both Mahmoud and we on his legal team and all of his supporters, including the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=720.08s)]
*  thousand-plus people who showed up yesterday and tend to fight to bring him back to New [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=725.2s)]
*  York and to vindicate not just his right to free speech, but everyone's rights to free [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=729.32s)]
*  speech. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=733.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, it can't be the case that saying something that the government disagrees with [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  becomes cause for a night arrest. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=738.24s)]
*  No one should accept that. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=740.8000000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, we'll fight that tooth and nail. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=741.8000000000001s)]
*  And we don't believe that this case will set the precedent that the government believes [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=745.0s)]
*  it's going to set. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=748.98s)]
*  You know, if the intent was to silence speech and to dissuade people from coming out in [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=750.88s)]
*  support of Palestinian human rights, well, we all saw what happened yesterday in Manhattan. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=755.02s)]
*  Over a thousand people came out, not just in solidarity with Mahmoud, but also in solidarity [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=759.1800000000001s)]
*  with Palestinians in Gaza and beyond. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=763.4200000000001s)]
*  And we don't believe that people are going to be deterred, nor is the movement that is [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=765.54s)]
*  critical of the ongoing genocide in Gaza and U.S. foreign policy and its support for Israel, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=769.1s)]
*  nor is that movement carried mainly by non-citizens. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=774.22s)]
*  I mean, that's also a falsehood. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=776.3000000000001s)]
*  The non-citizens are the ones who are driving the movement. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=779.22s)]
*  And of course, there are many non-citizen activists among them, but it's primarily [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=783.0600000000001s)]
*  Americans. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=786.5400000000001s)]
*  And so they're not going to be able to deport their way out of this movement. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=787.5400000000001s)]
*  Can you explain what's going to happen in court tomorrow, Ramzi Qasem, and also sending [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=791.78s)]
*  him to Louisiana? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=800.9s)]
*  Was that just outright punitive? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=803.22s)]
*  Absolutely, Amy. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=805.62s)]
*  I mean, our view is that his detention itself was punitive and retaliatory for his First [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=807.9s)]
*  Amendment protected speech in support of Palestinian lives and rights. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=813.3s)]
*  And then subsequently, moving him to Louisiana was retaliatory and punitive because he filed [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=817.02s)]
*  the habeas corpus petition in federal court, contesting the legality and constitutionality [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=822.1s)]
*  of his detention. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=826.1s)]
*  And so the government's response was to try to interfere with the court's jurisdiction, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=827.1s)]
*  to try to interfere with his access to counsel and to his family and to his support network [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=830.5s)]
*  By moving him a thousand miles away to Louisiana, where it believes it'll have access to friendlier [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=834.9s)]
*  immigration courts and whatnot. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=840.98s)]
*  So we hope, even though we don't expect the government to do the reasonable thing and [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=843.74s)]
*  voluntarily bring him back to New York, and if they don't tell us today that they're going [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=849.62s)]
*  to do that, then we'll be in court tomorrow asking the court to order them to do that. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=853.8199999999999s)]
*  And we will litigate the rest of the issues, including the free speech issues from there. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=858.5799999999999s)]
*  And what about the Columbia University—Mahmoud lives in Columbia University housing. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=863.3399999999999s)]
*  This direct appeal to the president of Columbia, saying he was living in fear that he couldn't [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=871.18s)]
*  sleep. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=877.14s)]
*  How could Columbia have protected him? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=878.9399999999999s)]
*  Did ICE enter private Columbia housing illegally? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=882.5s)]
*  There have been numerous reports of ICE in various Columbia housing facilities in the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=886.5s)]
*  last couple of weeks, some substantiated, some not. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=897.3s)]
*  That certainly raises a question about Columbia's role. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=901.7s)]
*  Bigger picture, though, Columbia's silence—well, I should say the Columbia administration's [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=904.42s)]
*  silence has been noteworthy and shameful. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=910.18s)]
*  For a university that has so often professed its concern for students, it is remarkably [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=913.86s)]
*  silent now that students are literally being abducted off of the streets surrounding Columbia's [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=919.86s)]
*  campus. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=927.38s)]
*  And I stress that this is the administration that I'm pointing a finger towards, because, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=928.38s)]
*  you know, as your segment showed, other parts of the Columbia community, whether it's the [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=933.6999999999999s)]
*  faculty or the students, have come out, and that's commendable. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=938.62s)]
*  They've come out in support of Mahmoud and of his family, and that's great to see. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=942.42s)]
*  But the university itself and its role in all of this has been, sadly, shameful to date. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=948.86s)]
*  I'd like to bring in Murad Awad, president of the New York Immigration Coalition, into [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=955.9s)]
*  the conversation. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=963.62s)]
*  Murad, your response to what has been happening now with Mahmoud Khalil? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=964.62s)]
*  This is, unfortunately, part and parcel to the Trump immigration agenda that we're seeing [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=971.74s)]
*  play out, from his family separation agenda to his mass deportation plans. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=975.82s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil also falls under the category of this Trump administration trying to do [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=981.0200000000001s)]
*  everything it can to stym people's rights. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=987.1s)]
*  You know, we've seen Tom Homan go out across Fox News, CNN, and other networks talking [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=990.5s)]
*  about how individuals who are immigrants don't have any rights. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=997.38s)]
*  This is sort of the rhetoric that they continue to hammer down on. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1000.36s)]
*  But fortunately, for everyone who calls this country home, they have constitutional rights. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1003.4000000000001s)]
*  And Mahmoud Khalil is entitled to those rights as well. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1008.2800000000001s)]
*  And what we're seeing right now with the Department of Homeland Security and thankful [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1011.32s)]
*  for the CUNY CLEAR as well as the Center on Constitutional Rights for stepping in and [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1014.88s)]
*  supporting Mahmoud in this moment, is that he has a right to due process. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1021.0s)]
*  And that in this moment, he has done nothing wrong. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1025.88s)]
*  He's not been charged nor convicted with any crimes. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1028.92s)]
*  And it's incredibly shameful that we continue to see Colombia, you know, spiral downward. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1031.96s)]
*  This university used to be something that was considered the cream of the crop of universities [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1036.92s)]
*  and one of the top Ivy Leagues. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1041.7600000000002s)]
*  There's a report from the Forward yesterday indicating that it may have been some board [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1044.1200000000001s)]
*  members of the university who actually called authorities on Mahmoud, which is incredibly [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1049.0200000000002s)]
*  disingenuous for an institution that continues to parade itself as an institution that wants [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1056.72s)]
*  to champion its students and build new leaders that we need for this world. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1061.48s)]
*  What message is this sending to not just their immigrant students, but all their students [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1066.0s)]
*  and families that this is something that they would be participating in? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1070.42s)]
*  And you mentioned the possibility of a connection directly to the university about his arrest. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1076.1200000000001s)]
*  Has the university issued any statement given the fact that they've been talking so much [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1082.8s)]
*  in recent months about free speech and protection of free speech? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1087.04s)]
*  It does not seem that they have yet. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1091.9199999999998s)]
*  They did send out an email to students shortly after the incident indicating that they were, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1093.96s)]
*  you know, aware of situations occurring, which only begs the question if Mahmoud was living [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1099.8s)]
*  in university-owned property and Colombia has policies on the books that says that they [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1105.1399999999999s)]
*  will not cooperate or allow ICE onto their properties without a judicial warrant, why [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1111.0s)]
*  was ICE allowed onto that property? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1115.32s)]
*  This is only even more so, begs the question, what is Colombia's role in this moment? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1118.16s)]
*  Let me ask you about a New York Times piece that came out right before Mahmoud was taken [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1123.72s)]
*  by ICE, saying, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1130.66s)]
*  versions President Trump issued in the first term, a draft recommendation circulating inside [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1141.0s)]
*  the executive branch proposes a red list of countries whose citizens Trump could bar from [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1146.08s)]
*  entering the United States, referring essentially to a new Muslim ban. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1151.6s)]
*  Yeah, and this is part and parcel to, again, Trump's racist and fascist agenda that he [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1157.0s)]
*  campaigned on and now that he is in office, is trying to deliver on. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1162.24s)]
*  We saw this happen in part one of Trump when he was in office and he's looking to revive [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1166.26s)]
*  that policy and actually put another ban in place. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1173.0s)]
*  We believe that it's imminent any day now, so folks who are, you know, intending to travel [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1177.08s)]
*  outside of the country should reconsider their travels and people who are outside of the [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1182.22s)]
*  country who have visas or are LPRs, green card holders, should be considering to travel [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l558ULKDyE&t=1186.22s)]
