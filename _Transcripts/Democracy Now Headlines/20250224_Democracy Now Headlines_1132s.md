We speak with death row inmate Keith LaMar live from the Ohio State Penitentiary, after the release of The Injustice of Justice, a short film about his case that just won the grand prize for best animated short film at the Golden State Film Festival. “I had to find out the hard way that in order for my life to be mine, that I had to stand up and claim it,” says LaMar, who has always maintained his innocence. LaMar was sentenced to death for participating in the murder of five fellow prisoners during a 1993 prison uprising. His trial was held in a remote Ohio community before an all-white jury. On January 13, 2027, the state intends to execute him, after subjecting him to three decades in solitary confinement. LaMar’s lawyer, Keegan Stephan, says his legal team has “discovered a lot of new evidence supporting Keith’s innocence” that should necessitate new legal avenues for LaMar to overturn the conviction.

*  I'm a poet, author and musician. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=75.04s)]
*  For the past 31 years, I've been in solitary confinement, buried under the never-ending [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=78.6s)]

*  On January 13, 2027, the state of Ohio intends to kill me. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=87.56s)]
*  I'm innocent. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=93.6s)]
*  Thousands of people around the country and the world have rallied around my cause, joining [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=95.92s)]
*  me in my demand for justice. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=101.56s)]
*  Here's my story. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=104.44s)]
*  When I was 19 years old and selling drugs, a group of would-be robbers in search of money [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=106.56s)]
*  forced their way into my apartment, a shootout ensued. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=113.4s)]
*  And regrettably, I took someone's life and was myself shot twice in the legs. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=117.04s)]
*  Facing a long prison sentence and on the advice of counsel, I pled guilty to murder and was [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=122.56s)]
*  sentenced to serve 18 years to life. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=128.8s)]
*  Determined to redeem myself and make good on my potential, I completed my GED, enrolled [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  in college and became a voracious reader in an attempt to repair myself to society. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=138.72s)]
*  I was in the fourth year of my sentence when, in 1993, a riot erupted inside the prison. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=145.44s)]
*  Apparently, a group of Muslim prisoners on religious grounds refused to submit to mandatory [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=153.0s)]
*  tuberculosis testing and were given an ultimatum, take the test or else. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=160.0s)]
*  Amid rumors of a forced inoculation, the Muslims took over the prison in protest, releasing [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=165.92s)]
*  some 400 prisoners from their cells and setting into motion an 11-day standoff that would [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=172.68s)]
*  ultimately claim the lives of one guard and nine prisoners. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=178.48s)]
*  I was on the recreation yard when it all began. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=183.2s)]
*  A guard came running out of the building with blood streaming down his face, followed by [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=186.44s)]
*  a masked prisoner who was carrying a weapon and yelling. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=191.28s)]
*  He'd taken over. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=195.48s)]
*  Against my better judgment, I went inside to check on my personal belongings. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=197.8s)]
*  A fatal mistake. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=203.04s)]
*  It was complete chaos. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=204.6s)]
*  When I made it to my assigned location, I discovered that it was being used as a holding [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=206.68s)]
*  area for hostages, both guards and prisoners. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=211.64s)]
*  I was there after approached by a masked prisoner who gave me the option to either participate [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=215.68s)]
*  or leave. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=220.52s)]
*  I chose to leave. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=222.64s)]
*  Hundreds of us gathered on the yard, waiting as the National Guard and Highway Patrol [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=225.64s)]
*  took up watch outside the perimeter fence. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=231.64s)]
*  Later, when dead bodies were dumped into the yard, they stood by and did nothing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=235.0s)]
*  It was as if I was trapped inside a nightmare. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=240.84s)]
*  Around 2 a.m. the following morning, we were rounded up and herded into the gymnasium where [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=244.68s)]
*  we were stripped naked and then violently forced in random groups of 10 into cells [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=250.36s)]
*  meant for one person. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=256.36s)]
*  Stressed and stretched to the limit, a fight broke out over food. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=259.48s)]
*  Tragically, I stood back and watched as a man named Dennis Weaver was held down by three [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=264.36s)]
*  prisoners and choked to death. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=269.68s)]
*  It was a cowardly thing to do, and I can now see and admit that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=271.88s)]
*  But at the time, I was worried about my own life. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=276.12s)]
*  When I was later questioned by authorities, I claimed to have been asleep. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=280.0s)]
*  It was my way of telling them that I didn't want to be involved. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=284.12s)]
*  But it was too late. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=288.64s)]
*  Because I had gone into the hostage area without wearing a mask, my name would be mentioned [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=290.24s)]
*  among a vast array of potential suspects. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=295.16s)]
*  Even though the state conceded that I was never affiliated with any of the gangs said [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=298.32s)]
*  to have presided over the ride. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=302.88s)]
*  The fact that I was already serving time for murder would play a big part in their decision [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=304.76s)]
*  to indict me. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=309.28s)]
*  Ultimately, I was charged with nine counts of aggravated murder. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=310.76s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=314.76s)]
*  Mind you, it was never expected that I would actually demand a trial. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=317.76s)]
*  He copped out once, he'll cop out again, was the prevailing belief. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=321.36s)]
*  In fact, no sooner than I was indicted, I was offered a deal. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=326.0s)]
*  Plead guilty and we'll run the time concurrent with the time you're already serving. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=330.48s)]
*  In other words, I would have gotten off easier had I actually killed someone. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=335.64000000000004s)]
*  But why me? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=341.44s)]
*  Why was I singled out for this undeserved retribution? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=343.24s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  One that I've spent the better part of three decades trying to explain. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  Here's what I can tell you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=353.56s)]
*  When the riot came to an end, Orozelis officials rushed into the prison without first securing [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=355.88s)]
*  the massive crime scene, rendering inadmissible some 22,000 pieces of evidence. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=361.67999999999995s)]
*  So there was absolutely no evidence to link anyone to crimes. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=368.56s)]
*  This meant the state had to rely solely on the uncorrelated testimony of jailhouse informants, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  the most unreliable witnesses of all. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=378.84s)]
*  What to do? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=382.96s)]
*  Well, the first thing the state did was enlist the help and expertise of the Hamilton County [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=384.0s)]
*  Prosecutors Office. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=389.64s)]
*  This was not a random selection. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=391.4s)]
*  Hamilton County has the dubious distinction of convicting and executing more than half [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  of all death row prisoners in the United States. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=399.0s)]
*  And how have they been so successful? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=402.91999999999996s)]
*  The answer is simple and deadly. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=405.4s)]
*  Through the impaneling of all white juries, the use of paid jailhouse informants, and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=408.52s)]
*  the intentional withholding of exculpatory evidence, I have now in my possession the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  statement of an actual perpetrator who admitted to murdering someone for whom I was sentenced [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=420.2s)]
*  to death. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=424.96s)]
*  And this is only the tip of the iceberg. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=425.96s)]
*  They withheld so much more. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=428.52s)]
*  It's over three decades later now, and I'm still in solitary confinement, being tortured [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=432.12s)]
*  because I refused to plead guilty to something I didn't do. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=438.44s)]
*  I'm innocent. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=442.92s)]
*  Look, we kid ourselves when we speak of justice. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=445.24s)]
*  Until we have a process that holds everyone equally accountable for their actions, this [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=449.16s)]
*  system will remain what it has always been, a punishment system. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=454.36s)]
*  And as we all know, those who don't have the capital get the punishment. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=460.52s)]
*  That's the new award-winning short film The Injustice of Justice, illustrated by the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=469.4s)]
*  world-renowned artist Molly Crabapple, narrated and written by Keith Lamar, who's fighting [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=476.76s)]
*  to raise awareness about his case and death row. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=483.08s)]
*  He faces execution January of 2027. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=486.68s)]
*  The film The Injustice of Justice just won the grand prize for the best animated short [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=491.56s)]
*  film at the Golden State Film Festival. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=499.08000000000004s)]
*  Keith Lamar has been held in prison for 36 years, 32 years in solitary confinement, 30 [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=502.12s)]
*  years on death row. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=514.04s)]
*  His self-published memoir has condemned the whole story. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=516.76s)]
*  He's joining us now live from death row at Ohio State Penitentiary. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=521.08s)]
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, Keith Lamar. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=525.5600000000001s)]
*  It's such an honor and pleasure. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=531.1600000000001s)]
*  I can tell you, I'm not just speaking for myself, but for so many people who are inside. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=534.84s)]
*  We have been speaking to you for decades and so forth. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=539.88s)]
*  It's quite an honor, quite an honor. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=545.32s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=547.08s)]
*  Can you talk about the making of this film, explaining your case and what you're hoping [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=548.6800000000001s)]

*  of other books as well, with high schools and other places. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=578.44s)]
*  Talk about your message, Keith. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=583.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, I, you know, from the very beginning just wanted to stand on my innocence. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=588.28s)]
*  You know, it was never really a matter of me not wanting to speak out, to stand up for [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=594.2s)]
*  myself. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=597.8000000000001s)]
*  That was the whole point of me demanding the trial. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=598.92s)]
*  But the whole system, I soon found out, is sitting around obedience, around operating [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=602.76s)]
*  within prescribed parameters and whatnot. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=606.92s)]
*  I was advised to remain quiet during my trial and day after, and I did. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=610.28s)]
*  I went along with it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=617.3199999999999s)]
*  That's what we do. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=620.4399999999999s)]
*  And, you know, other smarter, more learned people would speak on my behalf, would stand [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=622.36s)]
*  up and fight for my life. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=629.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, and I believe that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=631.24s)]
*  And I just kept going deeper and deeper into the darkness until I found myself in this [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=633.24s)]
*  really, really desperate place where I was really standing on the brink of my existence. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=639.16s)]
*  You know, I had to find out the hard way that in order for my life to be mine, that I had [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=645.0799999999999s)]
*  to stand up and claim it. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=649.56s)]
*  You know, so that was really the thing that was the catalyst that pushed me to start [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=651.72s)]
*  speaking up and reaching to utilize my own agency. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=657.16s)]
*  And all of these things that you just mentioned is a product of that general thrust, you know, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=661.16s)]
*  that thing that just comes to the conclusion that if I don't stand up right now, then I [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=666.4399999999999s)]
*  might lose my life. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=671.64s)]
*  And so that was the thing that kind of started the movie. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=674.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, I first started, I wrote the book, The Tremendous and the Demped, and that was [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=679.32s)]
*  over 200 pages. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=683.16s)]
*  And not long after that, a dear friend of mine, Lloyd Swain, produced a documentary, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=684.6s)]
*  which was 30 minutes. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=691.88s)]
*  And so we was trying to figure out a way to condense it even more because, you know, of [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=693.64s)]
*  course, people have short attention spans. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=698.84s)]
*  We understand, I understand that people have their own problems, have their own lives to [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=700.84s)]
*  live off. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=705.32s)]
*  And so, you know, it's asking a lot to ask someone to sit down and read a 200-some page [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=705.8s)]
*  book or 30-minute documentaries. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=710.68s)]
*  But we thought that if we could condense the story into a seven-minute short, then possibly [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=712.76s)]
*  that could garner more attention. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=719.24s)]
*  So that was the whole impetus behind creating the movie. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=720.5999999999999s)]
*  You know, my friend, my campaign manager, Amy Gaudet, was at the museum, Brighton Stakers [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=724.68s)]
*  Museum in Alabama and saw a movie that Molly Crappapple had produced. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=729.4s)]
*  And she had the idea from that that maybe this could be applied to my story, and we [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=734.12s)]
*  can, you know, put forth a similar project. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=738.28s)]
*  And we contacted Molly and her team and, you know, was able to raise the funding through [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=741.72s)]
*  this very kind individual named David Rouse. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=750.36s)]
*  And, you know, next thing you know, we had a movie on our hands. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=753.48s)]
*  And so, yeah, I'm really, really grateful for the whole process, for sure. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=757.64s)]
*  So, Keith Lamar, in your book Condemned, about Bobby Sands, if you can explain who he is, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=761.0s)]
*  his hunger strike and how it inspired you to go on a hunger strike, which led to your [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=769.96s)]
*  case being known. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=774.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, you've been written about in The New York Times. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  You have jazz greats playing with you, supporting your cause. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=778.48s)]
*  Yeah, one of my friends who I think you might know named Stoughton Lynn was a famous historian, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=785.0s)]
*  social activist. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=796.12s)]
*  He, in the beginning, when I was first sentenced to death, he somehow found his way into my [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=797.12s)]
*  life. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=804.48s)]
*  And he sent me that book by Bobby Sands, Nothing But an Unfinished Song, written by Dennis [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=805.48s)]
*  O'Hern, who had since become a very close friend of mine. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=810.6s)]
*  And he sent me that book. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=814.6800000000001s)]
*  And as I was reading it, it felt as if I was being sent a message. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=815.6800000000001s)]
*  If I had been pleading with these people, it's going on 18 years in a civil suit with [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  eight years old to no avail. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=826.12s)]
*  And, you know, I was reading this book, and it was almost a last-ditch effort before I [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=829.72s)]
*  was about to give up. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=834.84s)]
*  And Bobby Sands and his comrade, Bobby Sands, for those who don't know, was the Ivers prisoner [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=837.12s)]
*  who, along with several of his comrades, went on a hunger strike in Ireland. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=842.6s)]
*  And, you know, some of their demands were very basic, just to be treated as human beings, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=847.0s)]
*  which, of course, resonated with me. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=851.36s)]
*  And not long after I finished that book, I reached out to the author, Dennis O'Hern. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=854.32s)]
*  I wrote him. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=859.5600000000001s)]
*  We struck up a correspondence. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=860.5600000000001s)]
*  He came to see me. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=862.1600000000001s)]
*  We became really close friends. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=863.1600000000001s)]
*  And I decided to undergo an act of hunger strike myself, along with several other prisoners [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=865.5200000000001s)]
*  here at the super max, went on hunger strike. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=872.96s)]
*  And after 18 years of not being able to break through court cases and all that, and 12 days [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=876.44s)]
*  of being on a hunger strike, I was sitting in the visitor room with my family. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=882.6s)]
*  And that was like a seminal moment in my journey. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=887.4000000000001s)]
*  It kind of taught me that if anything is going to change, you have to stand up and speak [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=891.08s)]
*  out, you know, on your own. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=895.6400000000001s)]
*  And, you know, one of my literary heroes, Richard Wright, he wrote in his book Black [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=897.8000000000001s)]
*  Boy, that if you speak out who you are, you will discover that you are not alone. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=902.32s)]
*  And, you know, then it started to take a firm and— [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=908.36s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=912.4s)]
*  I wanted to bring in your lawyer, Keegan Stefan. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=913.4s)]
*  In one of Trump's first executive orders, January 20th, was to restore the death penalty, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=918.0400000000001s)]
*  which includes the order that the attorney general ensures all states have necessary [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=924.52s)]
*  drugs. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=930.4399999999999s)]
*  This is Keith's second execution date. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=931.4399999999999s)]
*  What is it? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=934.04s)]
*  January 13th, 2027. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=935.04s)]
*  If you can explain what happens right now in court, where the case stands in court, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=937.04s)]
*  and the role of the Ohio governor, Mike DeWine, the position he has taken, since he, not Trump, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=945.56s)]
*  would decide what happens ultimately to Keith Lamar. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=951.9599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=955.56s)]
*  Hi, Amy. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=956.56s)]
*  And thanks for elevating Keith's case. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=957.56s)]
*  You know, Keith, unfortunately, exhausted his direct appeals long ago. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=961.56s)]
*  The state courts and federal courts looked at his trial and determined incorrectly that [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=966.88s)]
*  there were no constitutional deficiencies and upheld his conviction and his death sentence. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=972.0s)]
*  I do think that any fair-minded jurist looking at his trial now would deem it unconstitutional [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=976.84s)]
*  and overturn his convictions. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=984.16s)]
*  Unfortunately, the only way back into court is to find newly discovered evidence. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=986.08s)]
*  So me and a team of attorneys have been reviewing all the records in his case and talking to [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=989.96s)]
*  witnesses for the last two years, trying to turn up newly discovered evidence. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=993.88s)]
*  We have discovered a lot of new evidence supporting Keith's innocence. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=998.8s)]
*  I started as a skeptic. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1003.16s)]
*  I'm a prison abolitionist, definitely an abolitionist of the death penalty. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1005.0400000000001s)]
*  It doesn't matter to me if he's guilty. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1008.76s)]
*  He shouldn't be put to death. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1010.48s)]
*  But I can tell you, after looking at the record, talking to witnesses, there is no doubt in [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1011.48s)]
*  my mind that he is actually innocent. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1015.08s)]
*  And we are working to put together a motion based on the new evidence to get back into [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1017.64s)]
*  court so that we can prove his innocence before his execution date. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1021.2s)]
*  Unfortunately, you know, there is very little justice in the justice system, as Keith has [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1025.3600000000001s)]
*  noted. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1030.16s)]
*  So it's going to take much more than just litigation. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1031.16s)]
*  We need a mass movements of people, you know, speaking out, acting out and pushing the governor [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1034.52s)]
*  to pause his execution once again while we litigate. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1040.52s)]
*  Let me give the last word to Keith Lamar. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1043.56s)]
*  Keith, your scheduled to die January 13, 2027, second execution date, first was for lack [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1045.56s)]
*  of drugs to inject into you. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1051.92s)]
*  Your final message as—what is it? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1055.64s)]
*  May 31, you're expected to have a concert at Joe's Pub here. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1059.68s)]
*  It's your 56th birthday then. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1064.08s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1068.68s)]
*  You know, I've been living under the dread of death, as you noted, at the outset, for [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1069.68s)]
*  over three decades. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1073.6s)]
*  So it's not dying. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1074.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, I've already made peace with the fact that I'm going to die at some point [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1076.72s)]
*  and someday. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1081.76s)]
*  All of us are. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1082.76s)]
*  But the thing that really drives me is I'm here. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1083.76s)]
*  How can I live? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEZnJlKPSXw&t=1087.24s)]
