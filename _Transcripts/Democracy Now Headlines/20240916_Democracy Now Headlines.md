**Democracy Now Headlines:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbsy_QUyGM)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  A 58-year-old white man has been arrested in Florida as part of what the FBI believes
*  was an attempted assassination of Donald Trump at his golf club in West Palm Beach.
*  A Secret Service agent fired shots Sunday after seeing an armed man hiding in the bushes
*  about 300 to 500 yards from where the former president was playing golf.
*  The suspect, Ryan Routh, was later detained.
*  An AK-47 was found at the spot where he'd been hiding in the bushes.
*  Routh has been described as a former Trump voter who traveled to Ukraine last year to
*  help recruit foreigners to fight against Russia.
*  In 2002, he was charged with possession of a weapon of mass destruction.
*  Sunday's incident came two months after a gunman shot Trump in the ear at a rally
*  in Butler, Pennsylvania.
*  The U.S. State Department has approved a new $165 million arms deal for Israel to help
*  fund heavy-duty tank trailers.
*  This comes as the official death toll from Israel's war on Gaza has topped 41,200.
*  On Saturday, an Israeli airstrike on a house in Gaza City killed 11 Palestinians, including
*  four children.
*  Al Jazeera reports Israel also killed at least 10 Palestinians in a strike on a home
*  in the Nusaydat refugee camp.
*  Our neighbors here are all under the rubble, a family under the rubble, a man, his wife,
*  their children, and the neighbors next to them.
*  We were able to remove around nine martyrs, all of them children in pieces.
*  Israel has admitted there is a, quote, high probability that three Israeli hostages who
*  died in Gaza in November were killed in an Israeli air attack.

*  In Turkey, hundreds of mourners gathered Saturday for the funeral of 26-year-old Aysenur Ezgi
*  the Turkish-American activist who was fatally shot in the head by Israeli forces in the
*  occupied West Bank when she was peacefully protesting.
*  President Joe Biden has called the shooting totally unacceptable, but the news outlet
*  Zateo reports neither Biden nor Vice President Kamala Harris have reached out yet to her
*  family since her death over a week ago.
*  Aysenur graduated this year from the University of Washington in Seattle.
*  She lived in Seattle since she was less than one year old.
*  On the campaign trail, Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance are continuing to repeat
*  racist comments about Haitian immigrants living in Springfield, Ohio, including false claims
*  about immigrants eating cats and dogs.
*  During a CNN interview, Vance admitted he was willing to quote create stories.
*  The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about
*  cat memes.
*  If I have to—
*  But it wasn't just a meme.
*  If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering
*  of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do, Dana.
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump has vowed to mass deport Haitians in Springfield, even though
*  many have TPS, temporary protected status.

*  Mexico's highly contested judicial reform went into effect Sunday.
*  In recent weeks, judges and other court workers have launched a wave of protests against the

*  President Manuel Lopez Obrador celebrated the reform as he signed it into law.
*  Let's put an end to the simulation, because we also talked about living in a democracy.
*  But no, an oligarchy was in power.
*  Those who ruled were the ones at the top, a minority with a facade of democracy.
*  That was a simulation.
*  Now it is different.
*  It is the people who are in charge, and it is the people who decide how it is to put
*  into practice what Article 39 of our Constitution says, that our people have at all times the
*  right to change the way of their government.
*  President Lopez Obrador was sitting next to his successor, President-elect Claudia Schoenbaum,
*  who will be sworn in October 1st.
*  In Burma, flooding and mudslides from Typhoon Yagi have killed at least 100 people.
