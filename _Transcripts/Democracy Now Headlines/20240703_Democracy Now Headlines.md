# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” July 3, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [July 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcYSG-xVtLY)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Residents of Jamaica are bracing for life-threatening winds and storm surge.
*  As hurricane barrels set to make landfall Wednesday afternoon, the now Category 4 storm
*  has left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean, killing at least six people.
*  Ahead of the storm's arrival, the Jamaican prime minister, Andrew Holness, called for
*  a stronger climate action from wealthier nations.
*  Hurricane barrel is the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record.
*  It highlights the growing impact of climate change on global weather patterns, particularly
*  on small island-developing states like Jamaica.
*  While our carbon emissions are miniscule, our region bears the brunt of the impacts
*  of climate change.
*  The hurricane further highlights the urgent need for global climate action and targeted
*  support to enhance resilience against the escalating dangers of climate change.
*  Only two other hurricanes have made landfall in Jamaica in the last 40 years.
*  Later in the broadcast, we'll get an update from Prime Minister Ralph Gonzalez of St.
*  Vincent and the Grenadines.
*  Gaza's health ministry says Israeli attacks have killed at least 28 Palestinians and wounded
*  in the past 24 hours, after Israel's military put a quarter million Palestinians in the
*  city of Chanyunas under evacuation orders.
*  Among the dead is Dr. Hassan Hamdan, head of the burns and plastic surgery department
*  at Nasser Hospital.
*  He was killed, along with his entire family, after Israel struck their house in Derel
*  Balak.
*  Just hours earlier, the family had followed Israel's evacuation order and fled north.
*  Meanwhile, hundreds of sick and injured patients fled the European hospital on foot ahead of
*  another ground invasion of Chanyunas by Israeli soldiers.
*  This is Chanyunas resident Mati Abu Siraj.
*  There are no other hospitals.
*  All the hospitals were destroyed.
*  Half of them collapsed and went out of service, except the European hospital.
*  And now it seems that it will go out of service and there will no longer be hospitals.
*  Whoever gets wounded will die.
*  Syrian health officials are warning of the spread of disease after Israel's assault
*  on Chanyunas destroyed water and sanitation infrastructure flooding entire neighborhoods
*  with sewage and dirty water.
*  Resident Mohammed Abayuk said the disaster is threatening the health of his children.
*  When the Israeli army entered Chanyunas, they caused a lot of damage, and sewage flooded
*  into homes.
*  What you see here is nothing.
*  The greater suffering is what our children endure at home and the stench of the sewage.
*  The smell has caused many diseases for our children and little ones.
*  We cough, we suffer from the bad smell, everything.
*  Our children suffer from itching, bed bugs and other strange things.
*  We can't sleep at night because of the mosquitoes.
*  A dozen former Biden administration officials who resigned their posts to protest U.S. policy
*  towards Gaza and Israel have written an open letter calling on their former colleagues
*  to amplify calls for peace.
*  The 12 former U.S. government officials write, quote,
*  "'This failed policy has not achieved its stated objectives.
*  It's not made Israelis any safer.
*  It has emboldened extremists while it's been devastating for the Palestinian people,
*  ensuring a vicious cycle of poverty and hopelessness,' they wrote.
*  This week, Mariam Hassanen, special assistant at the U.S. Interior Department, became the
*  12th person to quit over Biden's support for the Gaza assault.
*  At 24 years old, she's the youngest such-resignee.
*  In 2020, she cast her first-ever vote for president of the United States for Joe Biden.
*  She spoke to Democracy Now!
*  Tuesday.
*  I resigned ultimately because I felt it necessary to advocate for Palestinians who are at the
*  hands of Israel undergoing a genocide.
*  And with the U.S.'s kind of funding and backing and support of Israel, I felt that being in
*  the executive branch, especially being a Biden-Harris appointee, made me complicit,
*  made me associated with something that I most definitely don't want to be associated with.
*  To see our interviews with other Biden administration officials who've resigned to protest U.S.
*  support for the assault on Gaza, go to democracynow.org.
*  Here in New York, a Manhattan judge has postponed Donald Trump's felony sentencing trial until
*  September 18th.
*  Trump faces 34 felony charges of attempting to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential
*  election by falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to adult
*  film star Stormy Daniels.
*  He was convicted of all.
*  The delay gives Trump's lawyers more time to persuade a judge the conviction should
*  be thrown out following the Supreme Court's landmark ruling this week that Trump has broad
*  immunity from prosecution for official acts he committed as president.
*  Former President Trump's ex-lawyer Rudy Giuliani has been stripped of his license
*  to practice law in New York over his lies and false statements about the 2020 election
*  and his efforts to overturn Joe Biden's victory.
*  On Tuesday, a panel of New York appellate court judges ruled Giuliani, quote, not only
*  deliberately violated some of the most fundamental tenets of the legal profession, but he also
*  actively contributed to the national strife that has followed the 2020 presidential election
*  for which he is entirely unrepentant, unquote.
*  Giuliani already faces criminal charges for election interference in Arizona and Georgia.
*  His law license is under review in Washington, D.C.
*  President Biden's meeting with Democratic governors behind closed doors today, as party
*  leaders grow increasingly panicked about Biden's dismal performance in last week's presidential
*  debate, where the president appeared halting, disjointed and frequently lost his train of
*  thought.
*  On Tuesday, Biden told donors at a campaign fundraiser in Virginia, he, quote, almost
*  fell asleep on stage, unquote, something he blamed on exhaustion from international travel.
*  His remarks came as The New York Times reported aides and others who have encountered Biden
*  behind closed doors notice he's increasingly appeared confused or listless or would lose
*  the thread of conversations.
*  On Tuesday, California Congressmember, former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said
*  both Biden and Trump should take mental fitness tests.
*  And for the first time, a sitting Democratic member of Congress has called on Biden to
*  step aside.
*  Lloyd Doggett represents Texas's 37th congressional district in Austin.
*  He spoke Tuesday evening with CNN's Anderson Cooper.
*  And I think we would be better off if we had a new candidate who could present a new vision
*  for our country.
*  And we can do that if we have an open and fair democratic process over the next few
*  weeks.
*  In India, at least 121 people were killed at an overcrowded religious gathering in Uttar
*  Pradesh state Tuesday when a sudden surge of thousands of worshippers triggered a stampede.
*  Event planners had sought permission for up to 80,000 people to attend, but an estimated
*  quarter of a million showed up.
*  Youth-led mass protests are continuing across Kenya, even after President William Ruto withdrew
*  unpopular tax bill in response to the unrest.
*  Protesters took to the streets of the coastal city of Mombasa on Tuesday denouncing police
*  violence against demonstrators.
*  They were met by armed forces who fired tear gas and charged at demonstrators.
*  Gen Zis are suffering because lack of job.
*  Lack of job.
*  There's no job in Kenya.
*  People are trying, are starving.
*  They are working hard, but there's nothing they can get.
*  This protest began in mid-June.
*  The Kenya National Human Rights Commission estimates at least 39 people have been killed.
*  Most casualties happen when police opened fire on crowds that gathered at the parliament
*  complex in Nairobi last week.
*  Over 360 people have been injured in what the commission described as excessive and
*  disproportionate police force.
*  Indigenous leader and political prisoner Leonard Peltier has again been denied parole and won't
*  be eligible for another full hearing until 2039, when he would be 94 years old.
*  Peltier, who is 79, has been behind bars for nearly half a century for a crime he says
*  he did not commit.
*  His health continues to deteriorate.
*  His 1977 conviction for alleged involvement in killing two FBI agents in a shootout on
*  the Pine Ridge Reservation was riddled with irregularities and prosecutorial misconduct.
*  Peltier's vowed to continue to fight for his freedom.
*  And a civil rights and criminal defense attorney Martin Stoller has died.
*  Over a legal career spanning more than half a century, Stoller represented anti-Vietnam
*  war protesters, Black Panthers, Attica prisoners and members of Occupy Wall Street.
*  In 2015, Martin Stoller spoke on Democracy Now! after he won acquittal for activists
*  arrested during flood Wall Street protests against the climate crisis.
*  The court found all 10 defendants not guilty, releasing them and basically endorsing the
*  position that they took that climate change is a serious, urgent problem requiring attention
*  and basically complimenting the defendants for being out there and protesting.
*  And then because the police department made a mistake in the way they ordered people to
*  leave the demonstration area, the judge said the order to leave was impermissible.
*  under the Constitution and therefore he found all the defendants not guilty for violating an unlawful order.
