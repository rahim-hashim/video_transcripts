We speak to bioethicist Ruth Faden about the Trump administration’s abrupt shutdown of USAID-funded clinical trials, ending access to critical healthcare and putting patients at serious risk. “We’re in a situation in which we’re going to leave people abandoned. And that’s utterly ethically unacceptable,” says Faden.

*  Dr. Faden, welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=100.0s)]
*  If you can explain exactly what you mean, whatever happens with USAID, what about these [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=102.6s)]
*  medical subjects, people around the world? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=109.0s)]
*  Explain what clinical trials are and what it means for the doctors and the researchers [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=113.88s)]
*  to get a stop-work order that means they cannot get their medicine or have some medical device [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=119.28s)]
*  removed or put in at the moment that it is supposed to happen. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=126.36s)]
*  Thank you, Amy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=131.16s)]
*  I'm going to do my best to unpack this issue for everybody listening. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=133.4s)]
*  You've already expressed much of the general concern, so let me try to make it more granular. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=139.88s)]
*  When people are asked to participate in a clinical trial, and this is true anywhere [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=146.28s)]
*  in the world, and it is certainly true of USAID-funded research, two things happen. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=153.0s)]
*  First, there is assurance to the people who are thinking about whether or not to participate [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=161.32s)]
*  that their interests are going to come first, that people are going to make sure the clinicians, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  the nurses that are running the trials, that they'll do their very best not to harm participants. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=174.04s)]
*  And the other is that we're going to keep our promises to you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=179.16s)]
*  You're going to take on some risk by participating in a clinical trial that will ostensibly benefit [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=182.4s)]
*  many other people as well as potentially yourself. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=188.8s)]
*  And in exchange for your taking on that risk, we're going to do everything we can to protect [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=192.08s)]
*  your interests. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=197.0s)]
*  Now that's the background sort of ethical playing field in which research with human [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  subjects is acceptable. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  When you have a sudden abrupt cessation of work on a clinical trial, you blow all of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=208.36s)]
*  that out of the water. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=217.52s)]
*  When a person's participating in clinical research, imagine yourself in a cancer clinical [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=219.52s)]
*  trial. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=224.16000000000003s)]
*  I'm thinking about your conversation with Angus just a minute ago. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=225.16000000000003s)]
*  It is often the case that that clinical trial is giving you your cancer treatment. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  It's the only way you're getting medical care through that clinical trial. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  Now if that clinical trial is on a dime, stopped, what happens to you? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=241.88000000000002s)]
*  Where do you go? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  Similarly, if you're in a clinical trial that's sesting out, I don't know, a new device to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  prevent HIV transmission or a new device to deal with heart arrhythmias, and you're [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=262.28s)]
*  going regularly, it's an experimental device, and you're going every two weeks or every [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  three weeks to be monitored to make sure that your health is still okay. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=276.58s)]
*  Now all of a sudden there's a work stop order and you've got an experimental device implanted [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=281.67999999999995s)]
*  on your body, in your body. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=288.67999999999995s)]
*  You can't take it out on your own. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=290.48s)]
*  Now what happens? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  What this sudden abrupt dismantling, and it's a mess, we don't know what's going to happen [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  with USID in the end, right? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  What it has resulted in is for the first time in a very long time, research funded and conducted [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=305.44s)]
*  by Americans. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=313.48s)]
*  We're in a situation in which we're going to leave people abandoned, and that's utterly, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=315.56s)]
*  ethically unacceptable. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=325.6s)]
*  Dr. Ruth Faden, we're going to come back to you at another time to talk about everything [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=327.0s)]
*  from Tuskegee to Nuremberg, to talk about the implications of this. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=332.52s)]
*  But I want to thank you right now for giving us a preview of what we are looking at in [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=339.64s)]
*  this country and around the world. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqbb60kBZF8&t=344.76s)]
