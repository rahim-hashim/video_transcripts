# Top U.S. & World Headlines — September 3, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m-AAhSM7lw)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In the Gaza Strip, at least eight Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike earlier today
*  as they lined up for bread.
*  The attack struck the front of a U.N.-operated school being used to shelter thousands of
*  displaced people in the Jabalya refugee camp.
*  The massacre followed the killing of 11 Palestinians Sunday in an Israeli attack on the Safad school
*  in Gaza City.
*  Many workers say a woman and a girl were among those killed.
*  The occupation forces have struck the western wing of the school, resulting in numerous
*  deaths and injuries among the displaced civilians sheltering there.
*  We are witnessing a true massacre and extremely harrowing scenes.
*  Civil defense and medical teams are working to recover bodies and save as many lives
*  as possible.
*  But the situation is deeply tragic, and the reality we face here is extremely difficult.
*  United Nations and Palestinian health authorities have administered tens of thousands of doses
*  of the polio vaccine to Palestinian children across the Gaza Strip.
*  The mass vaccination campaign began Sunday after Israel agreed to limited pauses in its
*  attacks to allow the campaign to go ahead.
*  This is U.N. spokesperson Louise Wateridge.
*  We had the first rain yesterday afternoon.
*  It was pretty torrential downpour for the best part of an hour.
*  And it's just a huge warning for what winter will bring.
*  The sewage water was flooding the streets.
*  Everybody here sleeping on the floor.
*  The shelters aren't waterproof.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces have returned the body of a Palestinian man
*  who died less than two hours after the Israeli military arrested him.
*  Family members and medical workers say there are clear signs that 58-year-old Eman Abed
*  was tortured and badly beaten in Israeli custody after he was detained Monday in the village
*  of Kafrdan.
*  Meanwhile, residents of Jenin are reporting shortages of food, water, power and medicine
*  Israeli troops lay siege to the city and its refugee camp.
*  Earlier today, the Israeli army also raided the West Bank city of Tulkarim, killing a
*  14-year-old Palestinian boy.
*  In more news from the West Bank, Israeli soldiers fired live rounds at Palestinian journalists
*  documenting Israel's days-long deadly raid on Jenin.
*  Israeli soldiers were also seen chasing and attempting to ram the group of journalists
*  with an armored military bulldozer as the Israeli army destroyed shops, streets, homes
*  and other infrastructure.
*  At least two journalists were injured in the attack.
*  Meanwhile, in Gaza, the 19-year-old beloved TikTok star Mohammed Medouh Halimi was killed
*  in an Israeli air strike on Hanunas Friday.
*  He'd walked to his local internet café, a tent with Wi-Fi, to meet a friend and collaborator
*  when he was struck and began bleeding from the head.
*  Halimi died in a hospital a few hours later.
*  He began uploading videos to TikTok and Instagram in May documenting life in Gaza and Israel's
*  relentless war.
*  In Israel, hundreds of thousands of protesters flooded the streets of Tel Aviv and other
*  major cities Sunday after the Israeli army announced that it recovered the bodies of
*  six Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.
*  Israel says the hostages were shot by Hamas.
*  Hamas says they were killed by Israeli airstrikes.
*  The discovery of their deaths prompted Israel's Labor Federation, His Tadrut, to call a general
*  strike to demand a ceasefire agreement that would secure the remaining hostages held by
*  Hamas.
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remained defiant despite the protests.
*  On Monday, he insisted he will not agree to any deal unless Israel maintains control of
*  the Philadelphia Corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt.
*  The axis of evil needs the Philadelphia Corridor, and for that reason we must control the Philadelphia
*  Corridor.
*  Hamas insists for that reason that we not be there, and for that reason I insist that
*  we be there.
*  After headlines, we'll go to Israel for the latest.
*  The United Kingdom has suspended some arms exports to Israel, citing a risk that they
*  might be used to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law.
*  On Monday, Foreign Secretary David Lamy told the parliament the partial arms ban would
*  not cut off the flow of most weapons from the U.K. to Israel, including parts for F-35 fighter
*  This is not an arms embargo.
*  It targets around 30, approximately 350, licenses to Israel in total for items which could be
*  used in the current conflict in Gaza.
*  The rest will continue.
*  In a statement, the British group Global Justice Now said, quote, under huge pressure, the
*  government is waking up to the fact that it must stop arming Israel.
*  But this is a half-baked ban which risks maintaining U.K. complicity in war crimes.
*  You wouldn't deal with the dangerous arsonists by having their petrol supply, they said.
*  In Iraq, the U.S. military says seven of its soldiers were injured last week in a joint
*  raid with Iraqi forces that the Pentagon says killed 15 fighters with the Islamic State
*  group.
*  Iraqi officials say Thursday's raid destroyed four hideouts used by ISIS, along with weapons
*  and ammunition.
*  Meanwhile, The New Yorker magazine has published images of the U.S. Marines' 2005 massacre
*  of Iraqi civilians in the town of Haditha.
*  The graphic images show many of the victims were shot in the head at close range.
*  Release of the photos comes 19 years after the massacre, and only after producers of
*  the investigative podcast In the Dark sued the Navy, the Marine Corps and U.S. Central
*  Command to force them to turn over the photos and other records.
*  The author and the broadcast will speak with Madeleine Barron, lead reporter for In the
*  Dark, who traveled to Haditha to meet with family members of the victims of the killing,
*  many women and children.
*  In Ukraine, at least 47 people were injured on Sunday when a Russian missile struck a
*  shopping mall and sports center in the northeastern city of Kharkiv.
*  Seven children were wounded.
*  That attack came just two days after another Russian strike on Kharkiv hit a residential
*  building in a playground, killing seven people and injuring 77 others.
*  A 14-year-old girl was among the dead.
*  Russian cruise missile attacks prompted air raid alerts in Kyiv and other major cities
*  overnight following a similar barrage on Monday.
*  Meanwhile, students in the Russian city of Belgarod, near the border with Ukraine, opened
*  the new school year Monday with online classes after a Ukrainian attack destroyed a child
*  care center.
*  Belgarod's governor said a separate weekend attack by Ukraine killed five people and wounded
*  46 others, including children.
*  Ukraine is continuing its incursion into Russia's Kursk region, even as Russia's military
*  continues to gain territory in Ukraine's east.
*  The Biden administration seized a plane belonging to the Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro,
*  claiming the purchase of the aircraft violated U.S. sanctions.
*  The plane, which was seized in the Dominican Republic, was allegedly bought for $13 million
*  through a shell company, then smuggled out of the United States, according to the U.S.
*  Justice Department.
*  Maduro's government condemned the move as an act of piracy.
*  This comes as tensions remain high following July's contested presidential election in
*  Venezuela.
*  Venezuelan authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Edmundo González, the opposition
*  presidential candidate the U.S. and allies have recognized as the winner of the election.
*  This is Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
*  This cowardly man, González Arrutia, has the nerve to say that he doesn't recognize
*  any of our institutions.
*  That is why the majority of the people who live in Venezuela agree that laws should work,
*  that there must be order, the Constitution should be respected and public government
*  institutions should do their work.
*  More than 10,000 hotel workers across 25 hotels in nine U.S. cities walked out on strike
*  over the Labor Day holiday weekend, demanding higher wages and better staffing levels.
*  These strikes come after months of fruitless contract talks between Unite here and hotel
*  chains, including Hilton Hyatt and Marriott.
*  Union President Gwen Mills said in a statement, quote, We won't accept a new normal, where
*  hotel companies profit by cutting their offerings to guests and abandoning their commitments
*  to workers, she said.
*  We'll speak with a striker in California and the local union president in San Francisco.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman in New York, joined by Juan González in Chicago.
*  Hi, Juan.
*  Hi, Amy, and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around
*  the world.
