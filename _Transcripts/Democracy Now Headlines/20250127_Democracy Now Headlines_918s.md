A dramatic standoff between the U.S. and Colombia unfolded Sunday with Colombian President Gustavo Petro turning back two U.S. military planes that were carrying deported migrants in shackles, saying immigrants should be treated with dignity. The two countries then traded tariff threats before announcing a deal in which Colombia would begin accepting flights of deported migrants. Meanwhile, Trump has sent 1,500 active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, further militarizing the region. "We're very, very concerned," says immigration activist Fernando García of the El Paso, Texas-based Border Network for Human Rights, whose organization is among those providing resources like Know Your Rights training to immigrants now living under a regime of "anxiety and fear."

We also look at the impact of President Trump's halting of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program with Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, a faith-based nonprofit that helps place and resource refugees upon their arrival in the U.S. as part of the program. Some 100,000 refugees were settled in the United States last year under the highly selective program, which has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades. Now thousands of people already approved to come to the United States are stranded in unstable situations, with uncertain legal status in the U.S., or unable to leave dangerous conditions of war or persecution in their home countries. Vignarajah says the Refugee Admissions Program "reflects the spirit of American generosity," and highlights the plight of approved Afghan refugees who now risk retribution from the Taliban as evidence of the importance of refugee resettlement to U.S. foreign policy.

# "Anxiety and Fear": Trump Militarizes Border, Ramps Up Deportation Flights, Halts Refugee Admissions
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=2.52s)]
*  We turn now to President Trump's crackdown on immigration. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=3.52s)]
*  The White House says Colombia has agreed to begin accepting flights of deported migrants [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=6.48s)]
*  to land in Colombia after a dramatic standoff between the U.S. and Colombia unfolded on [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=10.36s)]
*  Sunday, with the Colombian President Gustavo Petro turning back to U.S. military planes [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=16.68s)]
*  that were carrying deported migrants in shackles, saying immigrants should be treated with dignity. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=21.5s)]
*  President Trump then imposed new tariffs and sanctions on Colombia, 25 percent tariffs [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=27.28s)]
*  that he said would go up to 50 percent. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=32.36s)]
*  Petro responded with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, but within hours, the White [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=34.72s)]
*  House announced a deal had been reached. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=39.260000000000005s)]
*  The standoff with Colombia comes as the Trump administration announces nearly a thousand [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=41.5s)]
*  people arrested Sunday as federal agencies carried out immigration raids in Chicago, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=45.72s)]
*  in Newark and in other cities. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=52.16s)]
*  Local communities are pushing back. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  This comes as the Pentagon sending 1,500 active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, including [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=56.36s)]
*  500 Marines, where they'll join thousands of National Guard and Reserve forces already [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=62.42s)]
*  deployed there. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=67.86s)]
*  For more, we're going to Mexico City, where we're joined by Fernando Garcia, founder [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=69.3s)]
*  and executive director of the El Paso, Texas-based Border Network for Human Rights. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=73.4s)]
*  Fernando, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=78.6s)]
*  There are so many developments around migration. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=80.84s)]
*  Talk about the increased militarization on the border for beginning. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=84.04s)]
*  Hi, Amy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=87.96s)]
*  Thanks for having me again. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=88.96s)]
*  Well, we see it again. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=91.36s)]
*  I mean, this is not the first time that we have seen the deployment of the military, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=92.72s)]
*  the U.S. military to the border specifically. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=98.4s)]
*  We have seen it multiple times, but this time it seems that it's a little bit different. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=101.56s)]
*  And however, we're very, very concerned. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=106.52s)]
*  We don't know what is going to be the scale and the magnitude of the deployment. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=108.8s)]
*  As you mentioned, we have at least now 1,500 attitude soldiers being deployed specifically [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=113.44s)]
*  in El Paso, where they're going to be trained for police military base. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=120.2s)]
*  Then maybe they're going to be deployed in other parts of the border. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=127.6s)]
*  But it's very problematic in many ways. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=131.04s)]
*  As you know, we had had incidents in the past where the military has been deployed and they [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=133.12s)]
*  had engaged with civilians both in the Mexican side of the border, but also on the U.S. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=137.64s)]
*  side of the border. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=144.6s)]
*  We had the incidents in 1997 in Redford, Texas, where the Joint Task Force Six Marine Unit [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  killed a U.S. citizen, Ezekiel Hernandez. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=152.88s)]
*  So that is part of the context we're seeing right now in this deployment on the Trump [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=156.48s)]
*  administration. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=162.16s)]
*  And you're in Mexico City. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=163.16s)]
*  We usually talk to you in El Paso. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=165.96s)]
*  Mexico refused to accept a U.S. deportation flight, like Colombia. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=168.0s)]
*  But then the White House press secretary, Trump's press secretary, tweeted that they [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=173.4s)]
*  then accepted four deportation flights. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=179.32s)]
*  Can you talk about what's happening in Mexico right now and what President Trump's re-establishing [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=182.12s)]
*  the remain in Mexico edict for migrants trying to cross into the United States? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=189.56s)]
*  You know, listen, it is quite unclear what Mexico specifically is going to do. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=195.96s)]
*  What we know is what the Trump administration is doing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  They're trying to re-implement two different processes for—towards Mexico. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=205.88s)]
*  The first one is these return flights. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=211.12s)]
*  We don't know if these are only Mexicans. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=214.16s)]
*  Obviously, Mexico had said in the past that they're just going to accept Mexican nationals [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  coming back or being returned and deported. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  But also, the other part of the program is what is called the remain in Mexico. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  That means even other nationalities, not only Mexicans, would be sent back to border cities [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=228.48s)]
*  such as Ciudad Juarez, close to El Paso, or Tijuana in California. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=236.04s)]
*  That is the two different programs that are actually being implemented in Mexico. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=242.24s)]
*  Mexico had said it many times already that they are only going to accept Mexican nationals, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=246.56s)]
*  and they are not necessarily going to accept the deportation to Mexico of other nationalities. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=252.72s)]
*  However, that is to be seen. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=259.2s)]
*  As you have seen already, the United States is putting a lot of pressure in terms of economic [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=260.64s)]
*  tariffs on Colombia and Mexico to accept these new programs that actually failed dramatically [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=267.36s)]
*  in the first administration of Trump, where we have refugee camps along the U.S.-Mexico border [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=273.92s)]
*  with no essential services, no legal support, no food or water for many of the people that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=282.0s)]
*  is being deported to those border cities. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  Before we go, Fernando, there is a lot of reporting on the shock of migrants across [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=290.32s)]
*  the United States and the terrible fear communities are facing, but there's also a lot of pushback [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=297.12s)]
*  and organizing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=303.12s)]
*  If you can talk about what's happening with community forums, workshops, Know Your Rights [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=304.48s)]
*  programs from Eagle Pass to areas in El Paso and others, how you're pushing back? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  We just launched what is called the Community Education Program on constitutional rights. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=321.12s)]
*  This is something that we have been doing for many, many years, both at the U.S.-Mexico border, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=327.28s)]
*  but also in the interior of the United States, where we're teaching people about the rights [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=332.32s)]
*  under the Constitution. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=336.4s)]
*  I think this is specifically important today because people right now are having anxiety [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=337.84s)]
*  and fear not only of detention and deportation, but also of family separation. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=344.88s)]
*  What we are trying to do with this program is to give people the tools to help to deal [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=351.36s)]
*  with situations where they are confronted with law enforcement, especially with immigration [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=356.48s)]
*  rates in their homes, in the streets, in their workplaces. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=362.0s)]
*  We're just reminding people essentially that the Constitution of the United States still [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=365.44s)]
*  exists, that under the Fourth Amendment, for example, of the Constitution, they only can [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=370.88s)]
*  allow somebody to their property or house or workplace only with a search warrant or the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=377.76s)]
*  permission of the owner. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=385.12s)]
*  Or, for example, if they are confronted and being asked questions by law enforcement, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=386.72s)]
*  that they have the right to remain silent, that is guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=391.36s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  Like, those key elements, that's what we're trying to actually tell people, educate them [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=396.88s)]
*  and organize them around that concept of constitutional rights. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=403.2s)]
*  Fernando Garcia, we want to thank you for being with us. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=407.76s)]
*  We're going to be checking back with you frequently, founder and executive director [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=409.92s)]
*  of the El Paso, Texas-based Border Network for Human Rights, speaking to us today from [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  Mexico City. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=418.48s)]
*  We look now at the impact of an executive order President Trump signed on his first [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=419.76s)]
*  day in office that paused the U.S. refugee admissions program in order to see if it, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  quote, "...aligns with the interests of the U.S. and should be resumed." [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump's order led to the cancellation of flights for thousands of refugees already [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=433.2s)]
*  approved to come to the U.S., including children and families fleeing war, violence and persecution. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  This comes after some 100,000 refugees were settled in the U.S. last year under the program. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=445.28s)]
*  The order was condemned by the largest refugee resettlement agency in the world, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=451.52s)]
*  the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=456.15999999999997s)]
*  Vice President Jay DeVance, who is a practicing Catholic, responded Sunday on Face the Nation. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=458.47999999999996s)]
*  And I think that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops needs to actually look in the mirror a [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=465.91999999999996s)]
*  little bit and recognize that when they receive over $100 million to help resettle illegal [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=470.24s)]
*  immigrants, are they worried about humanitarian concerns or are they actually worried about their [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=476.24s)]
*  bottom line? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  The Conference of Catholic Bishops clarified in statement every person resettled through [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=482.24s)]
*  the refugee admissions program is vetted and approved by the U.S. government and added [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=486.56s)]
*  government funds do not cover the full cost of the services the agency provides. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=491.12s)]
*  For more, we're going to Baltimore, Maryland, to speak with Krish O'Mara Vinyarajah, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=496.0s)]
*  president of Global Refuge, formerly known as Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=500.96s)]
*  Global Refuge is one of the agencies that received a stop-work order on Friday from [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=505.76s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=510.64s)]
*  Krish, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=512.16s)]
*  If you can explain, who are the thousands of refugees all approved to come here, many fleeing [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=514.32s)]
*  persecution in their own countries, but their flights cancelled, and then groups like yours, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=521.28s)]
*  what this means that you've got a stop-work order? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=529.12s)]
*  Krish O'Mara Vinyarajah, president of Global Refuge, former president of Global Refuge, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=531.76s)]
*  and then groups like yours, what this means that you've got a stop-work order? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=534.24s)]
*  I appreciate that question because I do think there's a lot of confusion and conflation [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  around this issue, and I think people are throwing around the word illegal unfairly. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=539.28s)]
*  Refugee resettlement is a system through which individuals, families, cross an international [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=546.48s)]
*  border, they apply through the United Nations or the U.S. embassy, they wait literally years [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=552.64s)]
*  to go through extreme vetting—so CIA, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Interpol—in [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  order to go through these background checks, health clearances. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  Only when they have cleared those hurdles are they admitted to the United States. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=568.08s)]
*  These are the select few in that 1 percent of refugees are ever resettled in their lifetime. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=574.4799999999999s)]
*  And that's the reason why this is the gold standard of legal immigration pathways into the U.S. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  That is why this program has always had bipartisan support. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=587.5999999999999s)]
*  President Reagan resettled 600,000 refugees during his time in office. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=590.9599999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, for us, as the second largest network in the country, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=596.8s)]
*  it is heartbreaking because we have 6,000 families, children, who did everything we asked them to do. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=601.36s)]
*  They came to the U.S. They are here. And now we fear that they are stranded because, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=609.52s)]
*  in terms of keeping a roof over their heads, making sure that their children have access [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  to public schools, making sure that they have even access to food, it is a public-private [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=619.2s)]
*  partnership. No one is making money off of this. We work with community groups, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=625.0400000000001s)]
*  churches, in order to support these families. But we fear what the future holds because, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=630.08s)]
*  even for our Afghan allies who worked alongside our military, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=636.8000000000001s)]
*  we don't know how we're going to help them come today and tomorrow, this week, next month. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=640.0s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN So, explain, for the Afghan allies, I mean, for the people coming from Afghanistan, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=644.08s)]
*  these were the ones who risked their lives helping U.S. troops, helping saving U.S. soldiers' lives [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=649.84s)]
*  in Afghanistan? KATHLEEN HALLIGAN Yeah, so we made a promise to them. We said, look, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=657.28s)]
*  if you were going to face Taliban retribution, death threats, because you are risking your life, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=664.16s)]
*  your family's life, by working alongside our military, the U.S. Embassy, to advance our mission, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=670.3199999999999s)]
*  our promise to you is that we will not leave you in harm's way. It is why national security champions [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=676.96s)]
*  are such vocal advocates of the Refugee Resettlement and the Special Immigrant Visa [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=683.2800000000001s)]
*  program, because it's obviously not just the right thing to do to keep our promise to these [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=688.24s)]
*  individuals, but it's a smart thing to do, because the only way we wage a 21st century war is if we [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=693.36s)]
*  have the local support. And so, for these Afghan allies, their ability to successfully integrate [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=701.2s)]
*  into our local communities, because they are here, is now in question. And for the allies who we left [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=707.76s)]
*  behind, who the lucky few are able to travel, it's also unclear what happens to them. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=714.08s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN So, talk about the pushback and how you're organizing. Where are the hubs of refugees [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=719.12s)]
*  who are already living in this country, who groups like yours support, coming from other places? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=728.48s)]
*  KATE BAKER That's the beauty of this program, is they're not concentrated in one location. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=734.4s)]
*  They're not in some democratic city alone. There's a complex algorithm that we work with [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=742.48s)]
*  the State Department. We take into account if they have U.S. family ties. We take into account [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=749.12s)]
*  affordable housing, where there might be a concentration. We work with state refugee [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=756.08s)]
*  coordinators. Candidly, every single concern that was flagged in the executive order is addressed by [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=759.68s)]
*  a program that was designed and fine-tuned over four decades to address those concerns. And so, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=765.6s)]
*  they are in the reddest of red states, the bluest of blue states. Local communities work with us [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=771.36s)]
*  and welcome these families, because they know that this is such an incredibly powerful program that [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=776.72s)]
*  just reflects the spirit of American generosity. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=782.8s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN So, as you've said, this has gotten bipartisan support for years. What's changed? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=786.16s)]
*  KATE BAKER I wish I knew. I mean, you know, I expected during the election season that we would [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=792.7199999999999s)]
*  have some, you know, hateful rhetoric that we might hear, you know, kind of misstatements. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=800.24s)]
*  But I expected that in terms of in governing and executing these programs that there would be a [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=807.04s)]
*  really close look at those programs that are advancing U.S. interests and those that may not. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=812.08s)]
*  I hope that it's just a matter of taking the time in the transition period to just have a quick [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=818.32s)]
*  understanding of what these programs are. Secretary Rubio obviously has the experience of having come [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=826.1600000000001s)]
*  from the Senate, knowing fully well what refugee resettlement is. And so we are hopeful that as [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=831.44s)]
*  people understand the ramifications of not just the executive order but the work order that this [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=837.84s)]
*  will be reversed in short order. But I really—I pray that this program does not get caught up in [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=843.36s)]
*  politics. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=849.36s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN And how is Global Refuge, your organization, going to operate now? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=849.84s)]
*  KATE BAKER So we've done this work for 85 years. Our refugee resettlement program began [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=856.08s)]
*  when Lutheran pastors, professors fled Nazi Germany. And it has always been done successfully [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=863.92s)]
*  in partnership with community organizations. And so that is our plea right now, which is, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=869.1999999999999s)]
*  if you're interested in volunteering, if you're interested in helping this cause, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=873.92s)]
*  go to globalrefuge.org. But we're going to have to be crafty in terms of making sure that these [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=877.92s)]
*  families are supported and making sure that the U.S. keeps its promise to Afghan allies and making [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=884.0s)]
*  sure that a program that has been really perfected over four decades, that we don't [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=889.52s)]
*  accidentally dismantle it. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=896.0s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN Chris O'Mara, Vinay Rajah, we want to thank you for being with us. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=898.16s)]
*  President of Global Refuge, speaking to us from Baltimore. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGWRXGwShI&t=902.72s)]
