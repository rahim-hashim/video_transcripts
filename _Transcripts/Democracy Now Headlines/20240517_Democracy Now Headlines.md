*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel's deadly attacks throughout the Gaza Strip are intensifying, with thousands more
*  Palestinians in northern Gaza now cut off from food and water, as Israel says its troops
*  are fighting in Jabalia's city center.
*  Israel's attacks on Ra'a are also ongoing, after more than a half a million people taking
*  refuge in the southern city were forced to flee.
*  The U.S. said its first aid shipments have started via its temporary Gaza Pier after
*  several weeks of construction.
*  But the U.N. reiterated that all humanitarian access points to Gaza need to be opened up.
*  To stave off the horrors of famine, we must use the fastest and most obvious route to
*  reach the people of Gaza.
*  And for that, we need access by land.
*  That was the U.N. secretary-general's deputy spokesperson, Farhan Haq.
*  Many Gazans have rejected the U.S. pier.
*  These are displaced Palestinians in Nusayrat.
*  We don't want ships.
*  We want the border crossing to open for people to come and go.
*  We want safety.
*  We want official borders.
*  Those planes as well that they bring here with the parachutes and they throw food at
*  us like dogs, like beggars, that does not work.
*  It falls on houses.
*  It falls on people.
*  It brings us problems.
*  We reject dealing with the ships and the American ships because in the same way it gives us,
*  it will take away from us.
*  Maybe they want to take over the gas fields that are in the sea, or maybe they are here
*  to displace the Palestinian people and to transfer people from one country to another.
*  Spain has denied port access to an Israeli-bound ship from India carrying explosives.
*  Spain says it will no longer allow ships with weapons for Israel to use its ports.
*  Spain has also vowed to recognize Palestinian statehood by July.
*  from 13 countries signed onto a letter warning Israel to halt its ground operations in Ra'afa
*  and to get more aid to Palestinians.
*  The letter was signed by all G7 members minus the United States, Germany, France, the UK,
*  Italy, Japan and Canada, as well as the foreign ministers of Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands,
*  New Zealand, South Korea and Sweden.
*  In Haig, the International Court of Justice has ordered representatives for Israel to
*  submit more information about humanitarian conditions and its so-called evacuation zones
*  in Ra'afa by tomorrow.
*  The request came as the ICJ closed its second day of hearings on South Africa's request
*  for emergency measures to halt Israel's assault on Ra'afa.
*  Israel denied its carrying out a genocide in Gaza as it addressed the court today.
*  The briefings were halted for a moment when a protester yelled,
*  liars, as the Israeli delegation spoke.
*  Yesterday, South Africa presented its case.
*  We'll have more on the world court hearings later in the broadcast.
*  Police continued their violent crackdown and student-Gaza solidarity protests this week
*  with arrests and raids Thursday at University of California, Berkeley, as well as DePaul
*  University in Chicago.
*  This is DePaul's student body president, Parveen Mundy.
*  It's really important to us that, you know, for the people of Palestine, knowing that,
*  you know, I'm a student body president and I go to a university and at the same time
*  there are no universities left in Gaza, we're all responsible for making sure that our tuition
*  dollars aren't going towards genocide.
*  Mundy at Morehouse College, a historically black college in Atlanta, Georgia, voted 50
*  to 38 in favor of conferring an honorary doctorate to President Biden when he delivers a commencement
*  speech on Sunday.
*  Biden's visit to Morehouse has been met with protests from students over his response
*  to what's happening in Gaza.
*  In New York State, students at Bard College have just taken over the school's administration
*  building.
*  Meanwhile, Columbia students and faculty on Thursday celebrated an alternative people's
*  graduation at the nearby Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
*  We'll have more from that ceremony later in the broadcast.
*  This comes as The Washington Post reports a group of billionaires and business interests
*  privately pressured New York City Mayor Eric Adams to deploy police on pro-Palestinian
*  protests at Columbia University.
*  A WhatsApp group with some of the country's wealthiest people detailed donations to Adams'
*  campaign and conversations with the mayor.
*  Some of those involved include real estate magnate Barry Sternlicht, Daniel Lubetzky,
*  founder of the Kind Snacks brand, hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb and founder of Thor Equities,
*  Joseph Sitt.
*  The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's
*  funding mechanism that could have undermined the agency charged with protecting borrowers
*  from predatory loans and other abuses by banks and financial entities.
*  Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich praised the justices for protecting the CFPB from,
*  quote, attacks by shady payday lenders, adding, Since 2011, the CFPB has put $17.5 billion
*  in the pockets of 200 million Americans who have been defrauded, unquote.
*  In other Supreme Court news, The New York Times is reporting an upside-down U.S. flag,
*  which is a symbol used by Trump supporters and election deniers, hung outside the home
*  of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in January 2021, just days before Biden's inauguration.
*  The revelations are expected to reignite calls for Justice Alito to recuse himself from cases
*  related to the January 6th insurrection, including Trump's attempt to claim immunity from election
*  subversion charges. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has pardoned Daniel Perry, the U.S. Army sergeant who
*  is convicted and sentenced to 25 years for murdering Black Lives Matter protestor Garrett Foster in
*  2020. Ahead of the murder, Perry posted on social media he planned to shoot, quote, looters and
*  posted dozens of racist and Islamophobic messages and images. While people with felonies are not
*  permitted to own firearms in Texas, Governor Abbott's pardon means Perry will be legally allowed
*  to carry and possess a gun. In other news from Texas, at least four people are dead, nearly a
*  million are without power, after heavy rains and powerful storms battered the Houston area Thursday
*  night, causing massive floods and destruction. The Biden administration is moving to end all
*  new coal leasing in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana, the largest coal-producing
*  region in the United States. The move comes in response to a lawsuit by environmental groups.
*  Meanwhile, in Florida, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has signed a bill that removes all
*  references to climate change in state law and weakens regulations on pipelines, among other
*  measures. The move eliminates climate change as a priority in Florida's energy policy decisions,
*  despite Florida being on the front lines of the climate crisis as it faces worsening hurricanes,
*  rising sea levels, extreme heat and toxic algae balloons. In the Democratic Republic of Congo,
*  families gathered Wednesday to bury nearly two dozen children who were killed earlier this month
*  after rocket attacks on camps for displaced people near the city of Goma. Another 13 victims,
*  mostly women, were also buried. Mourners blamed the M23 armed group for the killings and condemned
*  neighboring Rwanda for backing the group. This is Congolese human rights minister Albert Fabris-Puella.
*  ALBERT FABRICIER, Congolese Human Rights Minister
*  A Congolese genocide for economic reasons is being perpetrated in our country by Rwanda.
*  War crimes, such as those of May 3 and Mugunga, crimes against humanity, have all been documented.
*  Rwanda has denied the accusations, saying the attacks were likely carried out by militias
*  backed by the Congolese army. Intensifying violence in the eastern DRC has forced
*  hundreds of thousands to flee as armed groups vie for control of the country's natural resources.
*  ALI KURAB, Rwandan President, Congo
*  There are a lot of foreign countries behind Rwanda President Paul Kagame,
*  and they're killing my people because of the minerals that the Congo has.
*  If they want to work with the Congo, they shouldn't go through Kagame.
*  Let them come and negotiate with us, and we will know how to make the
*  war available to them so that we can all benefit from it.
*  In other news about Rwanda, Human Rights Watch said Rwandan immigration authorities
*  denied entry to one of its researchers this week. Human Rights Watch said the move,
*  quote, exposes the government's deep-seated hostility to human rights monitoring and
*  independent scrutiny of any kind, unquote. Back in the U.S., immigrant rights groups
*  continue to demand the Biden administration immediately halt deportations to Haiti
*  and enact protections for Haitian migrants as the island nation faces a worsening humanitarian
*  crisis, deepening gang violence and political instability. Advocates said Thursday another
*  group of Haitian asylum seekers have been deported, the second deportation flight since April.
*  The Haitian Bridge Alliance said the, quote, deeply troubling policy places vulnerable individuals
*  in grave danger, unquote. And the Biden administration took a major step towards
*  reclassifying marijuana from Schedule 1 drug to Schedule 3. The move will not decriminalize
*  marijuana but acknowledges its medical benefits and differentiates it from lethal drugs like heroin
*  or meth. The move would also ease tax burdens on states that have legalized marijuana sales.
*  Biden hailed the monumental step Thursday. No one should be in jail merely for using
*  or possessing marijuana, period. Far too many lives have been upended because of failed
*  approach to marijuana, and I'm committed to righting those wrongs. As a senator, Joe Biden
*  authored the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act enacting new mandatory minimum sentences for drugs,
*  including marijuana. The law led to a fivefold increase in the jailing of black people.
