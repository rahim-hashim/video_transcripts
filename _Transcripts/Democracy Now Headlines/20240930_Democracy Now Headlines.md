*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Lebanon's marking three days of mourning after Israel assassinates Hezbollah leader
*  Hassan Nasrallah Friday in a massive attack that leveled multiple high-rise apartment
*  buildings in a suburb south of Beirut.
*  Nasrallah had led Hezbollah since 1992, was widely considered one of the most powerful
*  figures in the Middle East.
*  Multiple news outlets report Israel likely used U.S.-made 2,000-pound blue 109 bombs
*  in the attack.
*  President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris both described Nasrallah's death
*  as a, quote, measure of justice.
*  But on the streets of Beirut, Lebanese residents vowed to keep resisting the Israeli attacks.
*  You won't be able to destroy us.
*  Whatever you do, however much you bomb, however much you displace people, we will stay here.
*  We won't leave.
*  This is our country, and we're staying.
*  Do whatever you want to do.
*  We don't care.
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave the order to kill Nasrallah shortly after
*  giving a speech at the United Nations General Assembly here in New York.
*  As he was being introduced at the U.N., dozens of diplomats walked out of the General Assembly
*  Hall in protest.
*  Iran responded to the assassination of Nasrallah by seeking an emergency meeting of the U.N.
*  Security Council warning Israel is, quote, pushing the entire region into an all-out
*  catastrophe, unquote.
*  A prominent general in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard was also killed in Friday's attack
*  on Nasrallah.
*  Over the past 24 hours, Israeli strikes in Lebanon killed at least 105 people, bringing
*  the death toll over the past two weeks to more than 1,000 Lebanese, with 6,000 people
*  injured.
*  The Israeli attacks have also displaced about a million people in Lebanon.
*  More than 100,000 have fled from Lebanon to Syria.
*  Earlier today, Israel killed the head of Hamas in Lebanon, along with his wife, son and daughter,
*  in a strike on their home in a Palestinian refugee camp.
*  A separate strike inside Beirut, Israel killed three members of the Popular Front for the
*  Liberation of Palestine.
*  Fears are now growing Israel may soon launch a ground invasion of Lebanon.
*  Earlier today, Hezbollah's deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Qassem, vowed the group is ready
*  to confront an Israeli invasion in Gaza.
*  Israel is continuing to attack schools where displaced Palestinians have sought shelter.
*  Earlier today, an Israeli warplane bombed a school in Beit Rahia, killing at least two
*  people.
*  In Deir Ebalach, another Israeli strike killed Palestinian journalist Rafa Al-Udaini and
*  three of her family members, including two children.
*  On Sunday, at least four people were killed in northern Gaza in another Israeli strike
*  on a school-turned-shelter.
*  Israel also launched a large attack on Yemen's port of Hudaydah on Sunday, one day after
*  the Houthis fired a missile at Tel Aviv.
*  The Yemeni Health Ministry said at least four people were killed and 29 injured in the Israeli
*  attack.
*  An unprecedented tragedy.
*  Those were the words of North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper after Hurricane Helene devastated
*  a swath of the country from Florida to Tennessee.
*  The storm's death toll is nearing 100 and expected to rise as search and rescue teams
*  reach areas cut off by catastrophic flooding and landslides.
*  power and what's expected to become one of the costliest hurricanes in U.S. history.
*  At least 30 deaths occurred in Buncombe County, North Carolina, where the city of Asheville
*  has been largely cut off after the Swannanoa River crested six feet above previous records
*  flooding entire neighborhoods.
*  Asheville officials said residents may not have access to clean water for weeks after
*  the storm severely damaged the city's water treatment plant and piping system.
*  Food and water are now being airlifted into Asheville since many roads leading in the
*  area have been destroyed.
*  Hurricane Helene made landfall on Friday in Florida's Big Bend as a 140-mile-per-hour
*  Category 4 hurricane that had been fueled by abnormally warm water in the Gulf of Mexico.
*  Greenpeace posted a message on social media reading, quote,
*  Hurricane Helene must be a wake-up call for climate justice.
*  In Nepal, nonstop monsoon rains and floods over the weekend killed nearly 200 people
*  as rescue teams continued to search through the wreckage in the capital Kathmandu.
*  People were left marooned on rooftops as streets turned into rivers and major roadways became
*  blocked.
*  This was Kathmandu's heaviest rainfall in half a century as the climate crisis intensifies
*  extreme weather events.
*  Spanish authorities say 48 people are missing after a boat carrying refugees from Mali,
*  Mauritania and Senegal capsized near the Canary Islands.
*  Nine deaths, including a child, have been confirmed.
*  Another 27 people have been rescued.
*  The disaster could become the deadliest in the Canary Islands in 30 years.
*  The Spanish nonprofit reports an average of 33 deaths per day for refugees trying to
*  reach Spain in the first five months of this year, as many European governments continue
*  to crack down on asylum seekers and provoke xenophobic rhetoric.
*  In Austria, the far-right Freedom Party won this weekend's parliamentary election, edging
*  out the ruling conservatives and sending shockwaves throughout Europe.
*  But it's unclear if the Freedom Party will be able to form a governing coalition, as
*  all of its rivals have ruled out collaboration.
*  Party leader Herbert Kickle ran on a nationalist platform pledging to restrict asylum and migration
*  and expel non-EU citizens.
*  The Freedom Party was founded in the wake of World War II by former Nazis.
*  On Sunday, protesters gathered outside the parliament building in Vienna, chanting,
*  Nazis, get out of parliament.
*  That means social cuts for Austria.
*  That means lower salaries.
*  That means a catastrophe, especially for migrants and for the women who are demonstrating in
*  favor of abortion again.
*  We started demonstrating 40 years ago, and I can't do it anymore.
*  The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has accused Moscow of waging war on hospitals
*  after Russia struck a hospital in the city of Sumy, killing 10 people.
*  Meanwhile, Ukraine launched one of its largest drone strikes on Russia Saturday night.
*  Russian military authorities report they shot down 125 drones during the attack.
*  Authorities in Egypt are refusing to release Alla Del Fattah, the country's most prominent
*  political prisoner.
*  He was due to be released on Sunday after serving a five-year sentence, but his sentence
*  has been extended by another two years.
*  Last week, a coalition of 59 civil society organizations called for Egypt to release
*  the British Egyptian activist.
*  His mother, Laila Suif, spoke to Reuters last week.
*  I'm definitely angry, really angry from the way things are happening.
*  And of course, angry about him continuing to be imprisoned.
*  He wasn't supposed to be in jail for five years, let alone the five years before, in
*  his first jail term.
*  I'm angry about what happened now and what is happening.
*  But I don't have the feeling that I was expecting something to happen, and it did
*  not happen.
*  I never expect good things.
*  To see our interviews with Alla's mother and sister in Egypt, go to democracynow.org.
*  Vice President Kamala Harris visited the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona Friday and pushed for new
*  restrictions on asylum seekers.
*  Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from
*  reentering for five years.
*  We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators.
*  And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses
*  our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum.
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump is escalating his anti-immigrant rhetoric, describing immigrants
*  as animals during a campaign rally in Wisconsin.
*  They don't commit crimes like us.
*  No, no.
*  They make our criminals look like babies.
*  These are stone-cold killers.
*  They'll walk into your kitchen.
*  They'll cut your throat.
*  During the same speech, he claimed Kamala Harris and Joe Biden were both mentally impaired.
*  Meanwhile, Senator J.D. Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are preparing for Tuesday's
*  vice presidential debate here in New York.
*  In other election news, the Department of Justice has sued the state of Alabama after
*  it purged more than 3,000 names from its voter rolls.
*  In California, Governor Gavin Newsom is facing backlash from artists, lawmakers, labor groups
*  and others after he vetoed a bill Sunday that sought to regulate the artificial intelligence
*  industry.
*  The bill would have required tech companies to stress-test AI models before releasing
*  on the market, held companies legally liable for harms caused by their AI technology and
*  enabled a kill switch for AI technology that was abused or went rogue.
*  Backers of the bill accused Governor Newsom of being in the pocket of Silicon Valley.
*  In Georgia, a fire at the Biolab chemical plant in Conyers sent massive plumes of thick
*  smoke into the air Sunday, prompting the evacuation of some 17,000 residents and shelter-in-place
*  orders for others.
*  It's Biolab's third fire in seven years.
*  Conyers has a majority black population.
*  And in the U.K., climate activists from Just Stop Oil threw cans of tomato soup at two
*  Vincent van Gogh paintings, including sunflowers, at London's National Gallery on Friday.
*  The action came just hours after a London judge sentenced two other activists to prison
*  for throwing soup at the same painting and gluing themselves to the walls of the National
*  Gallery two years ago.
*  The judge said his harsh sentences of up to two years in prison for Phoebe Plummer and
*  Anna Howland, both in their early 20s, was meant to deter protesters from such acts of
*  civil disobedience.
*  It's the latest in a string of criminal prosecutions against activists in the U.K.
*  Ahead of Friday's sentence, over 100 artists and artworkers signed an open letter asking
*  for leniency for Plummer and Howland.
*  Protesters also rallied outside the London court to show support for the two activists
*  who've been described as political prisoners.
*  Recently in this country, peaceful, nonviolent people who protested weren't locked up.
*  That was really rare.
*  And in the last few years, and particularly in the last sort of two months, basically,
*  almost 50 people have been locked up for daring to nonviolently, you know, resist the oil
*  industry, resist the genocide in Gaza.
*  And that's just not acceptable in a democracy.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
