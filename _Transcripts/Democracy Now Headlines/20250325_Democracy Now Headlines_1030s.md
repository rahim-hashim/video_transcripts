Hamdan Ballal, the Oscar-winning Palestinian director of _No Other Land_, was attacked by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank community of Masafer Yatta, arrested by Israeli soldiers and held overnight. The group entered their village and started the assault shortly after residents broke their daily Ramadan fast. Ballal's _No Other Land_ co-director Basel Adra witnessed the attack. He tells _Democracy Now!_ that "settlers and soldiers together attacked [Ballal] physically, brutally, and abducted him," while soldiers pointed guns and fired warning shots at a group of villagers including women and children. Ballal screamed "I'm dying" as he was being beaten. "Although the Israeli military has accused Ballal and two other Palestinians of throwing stones at soldiers, another eyewitness, Jewish American peace activist Anna Lippman, says the accusations are groundless. "The double standard is so strong here in the West Bank that Palestinians know that if they were to touch a stone, that could mean their life." Adra calls on international intervention to end the violent occupation of Masafer Yatta, where "almost every day there is [an] attack." Since this interview was conducted, Ballal has reportedly been released from Israeli custody and returned to his family.

*  No sign of him since,' Yuval wrote." [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=72.8s)]
*  We're joined now by two guests in the village of Sassia in the occupied West Bank. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=76.44s)]
*  Anna Lippmann is with us, a Jewish-American peace activist from the Center for Jewish [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=81.36s)]
*  Nonviolence. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=85.75999999999999s)]

*  Also with us, Basel Adra. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=89.24s)]
*  He co-directed the Oscar-winning film No Other Land. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=91.36s)]
*  The film is based on his years of documenting Israeli efforts to evict Palestinians living [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=95.64s)]
*  in his community in Masafariyat south of Hebron. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=100.72s)]
*  Anna, let's begin with you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=104.56s)]
*  You were in the area of the attack. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=107.25999999999999s)]
*  Can you explain exactly what you saw? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=110.08s)]
*  Hi. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=114.56s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=115.56s)]
*  Yeah, so we were called, myself and several other activists, by members of the village [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=117.28s)]
*  of Sassia that an attack was occurring next to the elementary school. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=124.48s)]
*  We drove over from a neighboring village. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=130.08s)]
*  It took us about 15 minutes to get there. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=132.84s)]
*  As we arrived at the base of the house that the attack occurred at, we saw soldiers, sirens, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=136.64s)]
*  all sorts of things at the top of the hill. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=145.72s)]
*  Myself and two other activists exited the car, and we were immediately ambushed by mass [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  settlers with stones and sticks yelling at us. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=155.88s)]
*  One of the activists was punched in the face and punched in the neck. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=161.6s)]
*  Another was pushed and hit with a stick. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=166.26000000000002s)]
*  They began throwing rocks at us, and we ran back to the car. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=169.62s)]
*  They continued to throw rocks. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=174.22s)]
*  They broke the windshield. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=176.14000000000001s)]
*  They broke the back windshield. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=179.86s)]
*  They broke several of the windows. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  And it actually wasn't until Basil and several others ran over and begged the army that was [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  standing there to intervene that the settlers actually stopped. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=190.06s)]
*  So, as this was occurring the entire time, the army was watching but did nothing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=194.34s)]
*  And we weren't even able to get to Hamdan at the top of the hill, because the army, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=200.66s)]
*  who was refusing to help us, was also not allowing us to move from the location. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=208.14s)]
*  The settlers were masked, Ana? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=215.94s)]
*  Yes, they were. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=219.14s)]
*  There was about 15 or so masked young settlers who just converged upon us in our car. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=221.02s)]
*  The IDF issued a statement about the incident, saying, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=230.5s)]
*  "'IDF and Israeli police forces arrived to disperse the confrontation. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  At this point, several terrorists began hurling rocks at the security forces. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=238.18s)]
*  The forces apprehended three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks, as well as an [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=242.9s)]
*  Israeli civilian involved in the violent confrontation. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=247.94s)]
*  The detainees were taken for further questioning by the Israeli police, Ana." [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=251.02s)]
*  Yes, I mean, that's certainly what the Israeli authorities have said. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=254.66s)]
*  We know from what's happening in Gaza that they love to say lots of things. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=262.7s)]
*  When we arrived, Palestinians had already been attacked. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=268.14s)]
*  As Basil said, this was happening at Iftar, when everyone was sitting down for their meal [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=272.82s)]
*  to break the fast of not having eaten all day. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=279.53999999999996s)]
*  Hamdan was begging for his life while being injured. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=284.05999999999995s)]
*  And you know, the double standard is so strong here in the West Bank that Palestinians know [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=289.5s)]
*  if they were to touch a stone in front of the army, that could mean their life or the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=297.34s)]
*  rest of their life in prison. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=305.02s)]
*  So the very thought of any of the Palestinians doing this, to me, is laughable. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=306.85999999999996s)]
*  And it's such a double standard because we literally have video proof of the settlers [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=315.26s)]
*  harming not only us, but the Palestinians. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=323.58s)]
*  The settlers who claimed that Hamdan and others were throwing stones, they have no proof, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=327.58s)]
*  they have no evidence. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=334.02s)]
*  They simply told the army this, and that was enough for the army. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=335.62s)]
*  The police refused to help us, the army refused to help us, but they instantly decided to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=339.94s)]
*  serve the interests of the occupation and of the settlers. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=345.94s)]
*  I want to bring Baselatra into this conversation. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=350.22s)]
*  Basel, this is three weeks after you and Bilal and Yvall won the best documentary for No [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=353.42s)]
*  Other Land. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=362.3s)]
*  This conversation should be about congratulating you, because we haven't spoken since you [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=364.3s)]
*  were there in Los Angeles winning this award. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=369.9s)]
*  But instead, we see this taking place. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=373.94s)]
*  Basel, from your vantage point, when you came in, what happened? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=377.46000000000004s)]
*  And tell us more about Bilal, your co-Oscar-winning director of No Other Land. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=381.66s)]
*  We're trying to hear you, Basel. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=396.98s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=399.78000000000003s)]
*  Basel, can you start again? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=400.78000000000003s)]
*  Basel, can you start again? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=401.78000000000003s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  Yes, I'm starting again. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=406.73999999999995s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=408.21999999999997s)]
*  I am here at Hamdan's home. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  My colleague and my friend, since a long time, have been in the field together filming. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=411.5s)]
*  I'm here at his home and everybody at his family, including me and other friends, are [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=414.85999999999996s)]
*  worried for his safety. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=420.53999999999996s)]
*  He has been abducted since last night, injured. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=421.53999999999996s)]
*  His blood was in front of his home, where settlers and soldiers together attacked him [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=424.85999999999996s)]
*  physically, brutally, and abducted him. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=429.73999999999995s)]
*  Until now, we don't know his conditions and what's happening to him, if he gets a treatment [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=432.38s)]
*  or not. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=436.98s)]
*  Last night, at 6 p.m., I arrived in Susia village after I got a call, the water tanks [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=437.98s)]
*  stabbing them and attacking the villagers, women, children. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=448.58s)]
*  And shortly, a military jeep intervened and to help the settlers and more settlers with [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=454.21999999999997s)]
*  rifles, who started attacking us. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=462.78s)]
*  Everybody keeps throwing rocks at us. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=468.26s)]
*  Hamdan ran directly to his home, which is 50 percent from the first 50 meters from [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=470.58s)]
*  the first that have children beside the door to prevent any settlers to enter inside. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=480.74s)]
*  Basel, we're going to go to a clip of— Basel, Basel, we're going to go to the trailer [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=484.58s)]
*  for No Other Land so that we can adjust your footage, your audio. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=492.98s)]
*  It's too important. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=498.06s)]
*  We need to hear this description. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=499.5s)]
*  So this is the trailer that Bilal and Basel co-directed with their colleagues, No Other [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=501.62s)]
*  Land. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=511.02s)]
*  Come here. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=531.58s)]
*  Come fast. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=533.62s)]
*  This is a story about power. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=536.46s)]
*  My name is Basel. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=539.58s)]
*  I grew up in a small community called Mesafir Yatta. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=540.58s)]
*  I started to film when we started to end. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=545.1800000000001s)]
*  They have bulldozers. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=550.98s)]
*  I'm filming you. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=556.6600000000001s)]
*  I need air. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=560.58s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=561.58s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=562.58s)]
*  I don't want them to take our home. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=563.58s)]
*  You're Basel? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=574.3000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=577.3000000000001s)]
*  You're Palestinian? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=580.14s)]
*  No, I'm Jewish. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=581.14s)]

*  You're Israeli? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=583.14s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=584.14s)]
*  We have to raise our voices, not being silent as if no human beings live here. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=586.14s)]
*  What? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=592.54s)]
*  The army is here? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=594.54s)]
*  This is what's happening in my village now. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=595.54s)]
*  Soldiers are everywhere. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=598.54s)]
*  Who do you think you're filming, you son of a whore? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=600.54s)]
*  It would be so nice with stability one day. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=606.54s)]
*  Then you'll come visit me. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=616.06s)]
*  Not always me visiting you, right? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=617.54s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=623.54s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=628.26s)]
*  If you were in my place, what would you do? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=629.26s)]
*  Here's the trailer for the Oscar-winning documentary. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=632.82s)]
*  Won the Oscar three weeks ago, of No Other Land. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=636.7s)]
*  Basel Adra is a Palestinian co-director, along with his colleagues Yuval Abraham, Rachel [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=640.4200000000001s)]
*  Soor and Hamdan Bilal, who was beaten yesterday by the Israeli military and attacked by Israeli [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=648.7s)]
*  settlers. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=656.62s)]
*  And we don't know where he is right now. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=658.1400000000001s)]
*  I think we've adjusted the sound on Basel Adra, who is there in the West Bank. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=661.26s)]
*  Basel, again, describe exactly what you understand took place. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=667.14s)]
*  And tell us more about your colleague, Hamdan Bilal, who, when he was being beaten, said, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=671.3000000000001s)]
*  I'm dying. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=677.62s)]
*  I was in the place with Hamdan, with other friends, and shortly before, like, around [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=683.0600000000001s)]
*  20 settlers, with at least four soldiers, two settlers with rifles. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=688.18s)]
*  The settlers throwing rocks at us while soldiers pointing their guns toward us. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=693.3s)]
*  So we ran away from the place. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=697.38s)]
*  Everybody ran to different, like, direction. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=704.62s)]
*  Hamdan ran to his home, which is 50 meters. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=707.26s)]
*  His wife and children were there. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=711.9s)]
*  The settlers, like, organized Hamdan and chased him to his home with two soldiers. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=713.14s)]
*  They start hitting him while his children inside hearing him shouting, I need an ambulance, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=717.86s)]
*  I am dying. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=722.8199999999999s)]
*  A group of Palestinians tried to approach to help him. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=723.8199999999999s)]
*  The soldiers immediately shot live ammunition in the air to prevent anybody to come close. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=728.3s)]
*  And then the soldiers abducted Hamdan to a military base. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=733.78s)]
*  I guess, until now, we don't know what's his situation. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=737.38s)]
*  We have word from the well-known Israeli attorney, Lea Tzemel, who's representing them, that [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=741.14s)]
*  Israeli police told her that they're at a military base for medical treatment, but [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=747.4599999999999s)]
*  she said Tuesday morning she had not been able to reach them, had no further information [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=752.14s)]
*  on their whereabouts. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=757.54s)]
*  Can you tell us who the settlers were, Basel? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=759.6999999999999s)]
*  Did you recognize them, though they were masked? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=762.42s)]
*  No, two of them were not masked. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=764.9399999999999s)]
*  Two of them were in with rifles and not masked. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=768.18s)]
*  I know who they are. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=771.3399999999999s)]
*  I know they constantly attack Hamdan and his village. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=772.6999999999999s)]
*  The settlers that approached Hamdan and attacked him with the soldiers, before a few months, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=776.74s)]
*  he approached Hamdan in his home, attacking his family. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=782.7s)]
*  And… [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=786.7s)]
*  In response to the attack— [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=787.7s)]
*  In response to the attack of Hamdan, he attacked the soldiers. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=792.7s)]
*  In response to the attack— [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=801.7s)]
*  In response to the attack of Hamdan, the International Documentary Association issued a statement, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=804.82s)]
*  We demand Bilal's immediate release and that his family and community be informed [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=810.86s)]
*  about his condition, location and justification for his detention. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=815.62s)]
*  Have you gotten any response, Basel Adra, from the Academy Awards or any of the organizations [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=820.26s)]
*  since these attacks began? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=827.62s)]
*  Like, in Susia, the attacks are since January, where Hamdan left 45 attacks, like settlers' [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=830.62s)]
*  attacks on his home. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=840.78s)]
*  So this is not an isolated attack happening. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=841.78s)]
*  This is happening in a way, and the official policy of the State of Israel, by letting [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=844.38s)]
*  these settlers, Afriyatta and across the West Bank. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=853.22s)]
*  I've been seeing the news covering this. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=857.58s)]
*  I think also the Academy that covered this incident. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=860.74s)]
*  We need more serious international intervention for Hamdan, but for the communities to protect [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=863.9000000000001s)]
*  Palestinians all over, journalists in Gaza, Hamdan and everybody, not just Hamdan, because [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=870.5400000000001s)]
*  he won the Oscar. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=876.3000000000001s)]
*  He for sure deserved, like, to be protected, but all Palestinians living under this brutal [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=877.3000000000001s)]
*  occupation. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=883.34s)]
*  Have the attacks gotten worse since you won the Oscar? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=885.3000000000001s)]
*  It is. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=889.14s)]
*  It is. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=893.62s)]
*  Basel, your final thoughts today, as we talk about what's happened— [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=895.62s)]
*  To be honest, yeah, it is almost every day there is an attack. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=901.22s)]
*  Do you hear me? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=904.14s)]
*  Yes, we hear you. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=906.4200000000001s)]
*  Your final thoughts right now and your final demand right now for what you want people [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=907.82s)]
*  to understand around the world, what's happening in your area, in Yisafriyatta? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=913.62s)]
*  Yisafriyatta. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=921.62s)]
*  I need people to understand— [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=922.62s)]
*  Yisafriyatta. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=923.62s)]
*  The people need to understand this is not a racist, radical Israeli settlers who want [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=924.62s)]
*  to expose their violence and racism, which is true, but this is our official state policy. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=929.9399999999999s)]
*  The army and the police here are—army and police of the occupation. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=934.9399999999999s)]
*  The courts, our courts of occupation, everything to legitimize the occupation and to steal [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=940.34s)]
*  our land. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=944.22s)]
*  There is nothing here to protect us as indigenous Palestinians and incidents living in this [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=945.22s)]
*  community surrounded by these armed settlers. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=950.58s)]
*  International communities seriously need to intervene seriously against the settlers, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=954.14s)]
*  against the Israeli policies, against the occupation, which is illegal, to stop it and [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=958.7s)]
*  to stop the crimes so we can live our life better than this. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=963.0600000000001s)]
*  Baseladar, I want to thank you for being with us, Palestinian journalist, co-director of [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=968.2199999999999s)]
*  the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, speaking to us from the West Bank, from the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=974.1s)]
*  area where his co-director Hamdan Bilal was taken by the Israeli military, was beaten, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=982.54s)]
*  injured in the head and the stomach. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=992.18s)]
*  Again, his lawyer has not been able to communicate with him. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=994.6999999999999s)]
*  I also want to thank Anna Lippmann, Jewish-American peace activist with the Center for Jewish [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=999.5799999999999s)]
*  Nonviolence, for being there and talking to us about what happened. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=1004.74s)]
*  You can go to democracynow.org to see our other interviews with Baseladar and his co-director, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb25LxITek&t=1009.8199999999999s)]
