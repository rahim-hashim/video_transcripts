Over a thousand protesters gathered near Tufts University on Wednesday after masked plainclothes immigration agents snatched Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts Ph.D. student and Fulbright scholar, from the streets of Somerville, Massachusetts. Surveillance video shows agents approaching her on the streets near her home Tuesday evening and handcuffing her while she screamed for help. Tufts University's president said the school had no prior notice of her arrest. Last March, Ozturk co-wrote a piece in the student newspaper criticizing the Tufts administration's response to Palestinian solidarity protests on campus that were calling for divestment from Israel. Democracy Now!'s Hany Massoud and Ariel Boone were in Somerville at Wednesday's protest. "One of our community members was taken by armed agents of the state who kidnapped her from right outside her home," said Lea Kayali, an activist with the Palestinian Youth Movement. "People are here to stand up for the movement that she was punished for supporting."

*  The city of Somerville and many other cities in Massachusetts call ourselves a sanctuary city. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=186.0s)]
*  But what does that really mean if our neighbors are being disappeared [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=191.84s)]
*  by state violence for weeks and there's been silence and inaction? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  What our community needs to know is that how horrifying this incident and Ramesa's kidnapping [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=200.72s)]
*  may be, this is the terror and the threats that our immigrant neighbors live under every single day. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=208.0s)]
*  My name is Sam Alterman. I am a PhD grad worker at Tufts University. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=216.4s)]

*  Graduate Workers Union, SEIU 509. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=225.28s)]
*  I am even more proud to call Ramesa Ozturk a colleague, a union sibling, and a friend. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=228.4s)]
*  Our union stands shoulder to shoulder with Ramesa, with Mahmoud Khalil and Momadou Taal, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=236.0s)]
*  and with every worker in the United States who is attacked for exercising their free speech rights. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=242.8s)]
*  We believe that all workers, regardless of citizenship, visa status, or documentation, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=249.68s)]
*  have a right to be safe in their workplace and in their communities, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=257.04s)]
*  to speak their minds without fear of retaliation or harassment, and to participate in civic life. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=260.72s)]
*  100 years ago, during the first and second Red Scares, the federal government also attempted to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=267.04s)]
*  shamelessly and violently abuse immigration law to chill free speech and attack working people. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=272.64000000000004s)]
*  The labor movement fought back then, and we need to fight back now. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=278.72s)]

*  We had hundreds of Bostonians coming out here today because they are [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=288.16s)]
*  angered about what happened when one of our community members was taken by armed agents [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=292.56s)]
*  of the state who kidnapped her from outside of her home. People are here to stand up for the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=297.76000000000005s)]
*  movement that she was punished for supporting, the movement for a free Palestine and to end [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=303.12s)]
*  the genocide in Gaza. And they're also here to continue to support our immigrant neighbors [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=307.36s)]
*  who have been getting picked up by ICE ever since, you know, not just Trump came into office, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=311.44s)]
*  but Biden before him in every administration. So, we are out here to continue to demand [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=316.32s)]
*  a free Palestine, to demand ICE out of our communities, and to fight for collective liberation. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=321.2s)]
*  FATIMA AHMED, Muslim Justice League Member I'm Fatima Ahmed. I'm with Muslim Justice League. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=326.64s)]
*  Can you describe what happened to Ramesa? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  FATIMA AHMED, Muslim Justice League Member Yes. So, as far as we understand, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=331.92s)]
*  you know, Ramesa was actually under surveillance maybe for a day or two by ICE agents. So, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=336.23999999999995s)]
*  her neighbors actually reported seeing that these cars parked on the street for about two days. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=343.11999999999995s)]
*  And then she was on her way to an iftar with her friends. And you can see very clearly in the video [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  that these people just surround her and take her. They don't explain who they are. There's no [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=356.79999999999995s)]
*  indication on their, you know, no vests, nothing, no badges or anything. And so neighbors who saw [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=364.16s)]
*  this were, of course, frightened and reported it, assuming that it was ICE and it was ICE, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  in fact, that took her. I think 9-11 and the war on terror was obviously a huge escalation [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=376.72s)]
*  in not just surveillance and policing, but the structure of the government, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=384.88s)]
*  right, creating the Department of Homeland Security, creating ICE, which are now, you know, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=389.20000000000005s)]
*  these massive departments eating up our budgets and coming for our community members. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=394.0s)]
*  And every step of the way, you know, many community members have spoken out and said, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=399.6s)]
*  we can't accept these things. We can't keep adding more and more surveillance, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=405.12s)]
*  more and more policing, more and more militarization. It will eventually come for all of us. And I think [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=410.08s)]
*  this is the moment where a lot of people realize it is coming for everybody. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=416.8s)]
*  Some of the voices from over a thousand protesters who gathered near Tufts University [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=421.52s)]
*  Wednesday evening after mass plainclothes immigration agents snatched Ramesa Oztuk, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=426.88s)]
*  a Tufts doctoral student, from the streets of Somerville, Massachusetts. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFeYhaZPW0&t=434.08s)]
