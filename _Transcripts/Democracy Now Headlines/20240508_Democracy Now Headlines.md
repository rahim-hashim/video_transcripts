# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” May 8, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvR7rDbeci0)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, Democracy Now!
*  The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The United Nations warning Gaza could run out of fuel and drinking water today, following
*  Israel's seizure of the Rafa border crossing.
*  Israel's facing mounting global pressure not to launch a broader ground invasion of
*  Rafa, where more than 1.4 million displaced Palestinians have sought refuge.
*  U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned there's no safe place for people in Rafa
*  to go.
*  Even the best friends of Israel are clear.
*  An assault on Rafa would be a strategic mistake, a political calamity and a humanitarian nightmare.
*  I appeal to all those with influence over Israel to do everything in their power to
*  help avert even more tragedy.
*  Doctors in Rafa are warning Israel's seizing of the border crossing and its intensifying
*  attacks on eastern Rafa could lead to thousands of more deaths.
*  Marwan Alhams is the director of Abu Yusuf al-Najjar Hospital in Rafa, which was forced
*  to close and evacuate its patients Tuesday due to Israeli military operations.
*  The closure of the Rafa crossing means the death of thousands of patients, thousands
*  of injured will be martyred.
*  Nutritional resources, medical resources and humanitarian aid won't enter the Gaza Strip,
*  which means more diseases, more patients needing treatment that isn't available, more patients
*  with chronic diseases, new diseases we won't find medication for and therefore the number
*  of patients will pile up.
*  The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reports Israel's planning to hand control of the Rafa border
*  crossing to a private U.S. security company.
*  The paper did not name the firm but said it was made up of veterans of elite U.S. Army
*  units.
*  Meanwhile, the New York Times has confirmed reports the Biden administration withheld
*  sending 3,500 bombs to Israel last week out of fear the bombs could be used to attack
*  Rafa.
*  But the administration has gone ahead with approving another $827 million for other weapons
*  and equipment for the Israeli military.
*  This comes as Politico reports the Biden administration's indefinitely delayed issuing a report
*  to determine whether Israel has violated U.S. and international law in its war on Gaza.
*  Negotiations are continuing in Cairo, two days after Hamas agreed to a ceasefire proposal
*  mediated by Egypt and Qatar.
*  On Tuesday, family members of hostages held in Gaza rallied in Tel Aviv.
*  This is Shahar Moore Zahiro, whose uncle Avraham Munder is being held hostage.
*  We heard from sources involved in the negotiations that the one thing preventing this deal from
*  happening, the one thing separating us from the return of our loved ones, was and remains
*  an Israeli guarantee of an end to this war.
*  To Netanyahu and the government of Israel, we clearly say from this stage, if the only
*  way to get the hostages back is by providing an Israeli guarantee to end this war, then
*  bring them back and save their lives.
*  The police crackdown on peaceful student protesters continues across the United States.
*  In Illinois, police cleared an encampment at the University of Chicago.
*  Here in New York, police forces raided a protest camp at the Fashion Institute of Technology,
*  arresting dozens of protesters Tuesday.
*  Meanwhile, in Europe, police arrested more than 100 activists at University of Amsterdam.
*  Police also dismantled an encampment at Berlin's Free University.
*  Despite the police repression, new encampments continue to form.
*  In Cambridge, Massachusetts, students at MIT restarted a Gaza Solidarity encampment.
*  Meanwhile, at the Rhode Island School of Design, RISD, students barricaded themselves inside
*  a campus building, which they renamed Fatih Gabin Hall, after the acclaimed Palestinian
*  artist who died after being unable to get care in Gaza.
*  This is Santiago Alvarado of RISD Students for Justice in Palestine.
*  Fatih Gabin is a Palestinian artist who was martyred after being unable to receive treatment
*  because of the Israeli occupation.
*  And as artist, I believe that it is our moral duty to call for an end to genocide.
*  Here in New York, a local real estate developer was arrested after driving his car into a
*  crowd of pro-Palestinian protesters who'd gathered outside the home of a Columbia University
*  trustee.
*  The driver's been identified as Reuven Kahane.
*  He's a cousin of the late extremist Jewish rabbi Meir Kahane, who publicly advocated
*  for ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.
*  Meir Kahane served one term in Israel's Knesset before he was convicted of acts of
*  terrorism.
*  Meanwhile, in Arizona, a research scholar at Arizona State University named Jonathan
*  Udelman has been placed on leave after he was filmed harassing a woman in a hijab in
*  Tempe.
*  On Tuesday, President Biden spoke at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's Days of Remembrance.
*  He condemned what he called a ferocious surge of anti-Semitism in the United States.
*  My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel and its right
*  to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree.
*  New group Jewish Voice for Peace criticized Biden's speech, saying he, quote,
*  "'disgrace the memory of the Holocaust by using our history of persecution to justify
*  the Israeli military's genocide of Palestinians,'' unquote.
*  Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Senator Bernie Sanders announced plans to introduce a resolution
*  to condemn bigotry in all forms.
*  No to anti-Semitism, no to Islamophobia, no to all forms of racism and bigotry.
*  Adult film star Stormy Daniels testified Tuesday about her brief affair with Donald Trump that's
*  at the center of the criminal hush money case against the former president.
*  Daniels' testimony prompted Trump's legal team to request a mistrial, but Judge Juan
*  Marchand rejected the motion.
*  The judge also ordered Trump to stop audibly cursing during the trial.
*  Meanwhile, in a major development in another Trump case, federal judge Aileen Cannon has
*  indefinitely postponed Trump's trial over his mishandling of classified documents.
*  Cannon, who is a Trump appointee, said there are too many pretrial issues to resolve before
*  a trial date could be set.
*  In Brazil, search and evacuation efforts continue for survivors of catastrophic floods in the
*  southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, as the death toll has reached at least 90 people.
*  Over 130 are still missing.
*  The city of Porto Alegre has been almost entirely cut off by the flooding.
*  The airport and bus stations closed while main roads blocked.
*  Tens of thousands have been left without a home, forced to sleep in the street while
*  others are fleeing to other regions on foot.
*  Survivors are also struggling to find food and other basic necessities.
*  Chinese President Xi Jinping has arrived in Serbia after visiting France, where he began
*  his first European trip in five years.
*  She arrived in Belgrade on the 25th anniversary of NATO's deadly bombing of the Chinese
*  embassy in Belgrade on May 7, 1999, during the war in Kosovo.
*  The attack killed three Chinese nationals.
*  The state of Florida and the Catholic Medical Association have sued the Biden administration
*  over a new federal rule protecting transgender people from discrimination in health care
*  access.
*  The policy was published by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department Monday and draws
*  from an anti-discrimination provision in the Affordable Care Act.
*  Florida law bans gender-affirming care for trans children and youth.
*  And a cleaning company based in Tennessee has been fined over $649,000 after a U.S.
*  Labor Department investigation found it was employing at least two dozen children, some
*  as young as 13 years old, to clean slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants.
*  Fayette Genitorial Service was found to have hired children to work overnight cleaning
*  shifts at times using corrosive materials to clean, quote, dangerous kill floor equipment
*  at facilities in Sioux City, Iowa and Acomac, Virginia.
*  On Monday, New York Times reporter Hannah Dreyer won a Pulitzer Prize for exposing how
*  children, most of them from Mexico and Central America, risk their lives working at meatpacking
*  plants and factories.
*  Go to DemocracyNow.org to see our interview with Hannah Dreyer, as well as other Pulitzer
*  winners this year, including Nathan Thrall, Justin Elliott and Jonathan Eyeg.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
