The Trump administration claims an order to withhold funds from hospitals that offer gender-affirming care to transgender youth is "already having its intended effect" as hospitals announce a halt to gender-affirming care for trans patients. The American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and others filed a lawsuit Tuesday on behalf of transgender youth who say the order is depriving them of medical care "solely on the basis of their sex and transgender status." ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio says the situation is "catastrophic for transgender people of all ages, particularly transgender youth," and notes Trump's near-daily attacks are targeting a community that makes up less than 1% of the U.S. population. "We need to see people standing up." We are also joined by pediatrician Dr. Jeffrey Birnbaum, who has vowed to keep working with transgender youth patients in New York. "Keep politics out of science," says Dr. Birnbaum.

# "I Will Go to Jail to Defend Your Care": New York Doctor Vows to Keep Helping Trans Youth Patients
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s)
*  We're joined by two guests. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=0.0s)]
*  Dr. Jeffrey Birnbaum is with us. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=1.52s)]
*  He's a pediatrician, adolescent medicine specialist who works with transgender youth [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=3.68s)]
*  in New York City. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=8.84s)]
*  And here in our studio, Chase Strangio, co-director of the American Civil Liberties Union's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=10.3s)]
*  LGBTQ and HIV Project. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=14.92s)]
*  We welcome you both. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=16.96s)]
*  Chase, let's begin with you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=17.96s)]
*  You were the first trans attorney to argue before the Supreme Court. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=19.36s)]
*  We're waiting for that decision to come out. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  But you just filed a lawsuit. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=24.88s)]
*  Explain what it is. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=26.96s)]
*  Yeah, so, thank you, Amy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=27.96s)]
*  We are obviously living in a situation that is catastrophic for transgender people of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=29.08s)]
*  all ages, particularly transgender youth, with actions from the Trump administration [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  almost every day targeting our community that represents less than 1 percent of the population. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=37.68s)]
*  And one of those orders sought to, in essence, threaten and coerce hospitals across the country [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=43.36s)]
*  to shut down care, including in places like New York and California and Illinois and Virginia, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=48.84s)]
*  where people thought they were safe from the state-level bans that had been passing for [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=54.4s)]
*  the last several years. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  And what we're seeing now is that there is a lot of compliance in advance with this executive [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  order, as the rally in New York made very clear. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=64.2s)]
*  However, we also have to know that it is the Trump administration that is holding our entire [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=67.84s)]
*  medical system in the United States hostage to threaten people, to punish transgender [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=72.64s)]
*  people for simply existing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=77.12s)]
*  And it is not just transgender youth. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=78.84s)]
*  This is an order that goes up to 19 years old. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=80.4s)]
*  I have been on the phone with people who deliberately waited through their entire adolescence until [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=83.04s)]
*  they were 18 years old so that they could access medical care. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=89.16s)]
*  And then they had those appointments canceled on the way to the hospital on the week of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=91.44s)]
*  those appointments. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  The devastation is staggering. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  And we are in federal court to make it clear that, first, the president does not have the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=98.36s)]
*  authority to override Congress and decide how money that has been allocated by Congress [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=103.92s)]
*  as the Constitution makes clear can be taken away just because the president doesn't like [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=109.44s)]
*  how it's being used. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  And second, this action violates the individual constitutional rights of transgender adolescents [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  and their families, as well as transgender 18-year-olds. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=120.24s)]
*  And Chase, as you mentioned, the transgender population of the country is less than 1 percent. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=124.8s)]
*  Why do you think that the Trump administration has focused so much attention on repressing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=131.16s)]
*  and discriminating against the trans community? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=139.04s)]
*  I think the Trump administration is doing it for two reasons. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=141.88s)]
*  And the first reason is that the Trump administration, as the campaign spending made clear, thinks [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=144.68s)]
*  that transgender people are an easy target for him to engage in this type of power grab, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=150.56s)]
*  where he exceeds his authority as president, thinks it's going to be legitimized, and then [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=155.32s)]
*  he can use that excess of authority to start targeting all sorts of other communities that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=159.44s)]
*  do have political power. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=164.0s)]
*  But he seeks to have a precedent in what he believes to be a vulnerable and unsupported [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=165.4s)]
*  community. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=169.44s)]
*  So we need to see people standing up. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=170.44s)]
*  And the second reason is that transgender people pose a threat to the reinforcement [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=171.84s)]
*  of the sex binary, which is a centerpiece of this administration. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  This is about deciding and enforcing government-mandated rules about how men and women can live in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=179.68s)]
*  this country. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=184.68s)]
*  And this is a full takeover for all of us that we should be very concerned about. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=185.68s)]
*  It is part of the authoritarian move of this administration, exactly like we see from leaders [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=188.68s)]
*  like Orban, Bolsonaro, and others who use control over the body, the gender binary, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=193.96s)]
*  and the family to build their authoritarian power. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=198.52s)]
*  I want to bring Dr. Jeffrey Birnbaum into this conversation, a pediatrician, adolescent [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=201.56s)]
*  medicine specialist who works with transgender youth. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=206.72s)]
*  Can you talk about what's happening in these hospitals? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=210.96s)]
*  I've heard stories of one person after another, as Chase just said, about to go in for surgery, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=213.72s)]
*  having all the medical preparation and then being told it's canceled. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=221.0s)]
*  Do you say you're willing to go to jail to continue to provide medical care for your patients? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=226.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=232.56s)]
*  You know, since I was quoted as saying that in the paper the other day—and I stand by [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=233.56s)]
*  my words—I've learned that there's more risk that comes to hospitals, at this point [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=241.28s)]
*  in time at least, than providers in terms of having their funding cut off and having [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=246.24s)]
*  their grants and so on turned off and just having the flow of money into their institutions [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=251.84s)]
*  turned off more so than providers. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=257.08s)]
*  But I stand by my words. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=259.96000000000004s)]
*  Since the NYU news came out and people have been turned away—we've actually gotten [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  phone calls in my clinic of people who were just desperate to be able to come into care, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  and so we've accepted some of the people who have been turned away by NYU. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=278.12s)]
*  I hope at some point they come to their senses and reverse their stance. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=283.24s)]
*  My hospital—and I'm speaking my own views, I'm not necessarily speaking theirs—but [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=289.44s)]
*  they've been very supportive of me to continue to be able to do my work, but they've asked [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=295.0s)]
*  me to ensure that I may get clear that I'm speaking my views and not theirs for some [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=300.32000000000005s)]
*  very obvious reasons. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=307.44s)]
*  And Dr. Birnbaum, your thoughts on an executive order that declares that there are just two [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=310.56s)]
*  sexes, male and female, the impact that this has on the population, especially the transgender [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=316.24s)]
*  population? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=324.32s)]
*  I mean, it's a highly ill-informed and uninformed position for them to take. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=325.84s)]
*  We're talking about biology, not politics, and some of these folks, if they wanted to, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  go into science, they should become scientists and stay out of—and keep politics out of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=338.08s)]
*  science. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=345.12s)]
*  We have tons and tons of medical literature that backs up the practice that we're doing [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=346.08s)]
*  through the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, the Endocrine Society. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=352.96s)]
*  You look at the references that they follow. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  Of course, there's more research that needs to be done. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=361.44s)]
*  We're doing something that is scientifically based, and they're just making this up. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=364.32s)]
*  If they want to accuse us of espousing gender ideology, well, we're following science, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  and they're the ones that are really espousing gender ideology. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=375.12s)]
*  Dr. Birnbaum, you have been getting texts nonstop and calls from your patients. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=379.2s)]
*  What does it mean to interrupt transgender care? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=384.96s)]
*  Yeah, they are terrified that their care is going to be interrupted. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  Many of the young people that I take care of prior to coming into care were suicidal—actually [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=394.56s)]
*  referred to us by psychiatric units for ongoing care after they were hospitalized for a suicidal [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=400.08s)]
*  event. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=408.32s)]
*  And they fear going back to that state where they did not have access to gender-affirming [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=409.91999999999996s)]
*  hormonal therapy. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=417.12s)]
*  And so I've had to make reassurances. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=418.72s)]
*  I've stated to them what I was quoted in the paper saying, I will go to jail to defend your [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=423.12s)]
*  care. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=428.0s)]
*  Your care is not stopping. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=428.56s)]
*  This is a safe space where you access your care, and it's going to remain that way. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  I anticipate that if the executive order were to go through, there will be deaths involved. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=436.16s)]
*  One of the quotes from the young people at the protest the other day saying this was [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=443.12s)]
*  life-saving care—and I ascribe to that notion that it is life-saving, it is certainly life-affirming [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=448.96s)]
*  care, and to take that care away from them will definitely increase levels of dysphoria in young [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=456.56s)]
*  people, and many of them will go on to commit suicide or at least think about it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=462.88s)]
*  Well, I want to end with Chase Strangio. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=467.6s)]
*  How does this relate to the Supreme Court case and what will happen with the decision [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=469.84s)]
*  that will be handed down? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=474.4s)]
*  And also, the state attorney general, Letitia James, weighing in. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=476.64s)]
*  We are at the Supreme Court right now arguing that this very type of attack on medical care [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=483.2s)]
*  for transgender people violates the Constitution. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=488.32s)]
*  Now, we are up against state officials and now federal officials that are trying to undo [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=490.55999999999995s)]
*  equal protection—protections for the entire population. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=494.96s)]
*  So this is going to be a major test at the Supreme Court this term. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=498.64s)]
*  It will have impacts for these executive orders and whether or not they're constitutional. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=501.68s)]
*  But even putting Scrametti aside, which is the case at the Supreme Court, this exceeds [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=506.08s)]
*  the president's authority. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=509.68s)]
*  There are very clear constitutional limits on what the executive branch can do, what the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=510.8s)]
*  legislative branch can do, and what the judicial branch can do. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=515.12s)]
*  And we see the president far exceeding his authority. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=517.76s)]
*  And thankfully, there are attorney generals across the country that are stepping in, suing [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=520.4s)]
*  the administration, reminding entities in New York state that they have to continue [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiZLtt6nR7s&t=524.0s)]
