# Top U.S. & World Headlines — July 12, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [July 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIBEpJZGL8s)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  President Biden took to the podium Thursday evening for his first solo press conference
*  in E! this year.
*  As debate over whether Biden should remain, the Democratic nominee reaches a fever pitch.
*  Biden remained defiant, saying he's determined to, quote, finish the job, and reasserting
*  his best position to beat Donald Trump.
*  Biden addressed concerns about his mental fitness.
*  I've taken three significant and intense neurological exams by a neurologist.
*  In each case, it's recent as February.
*  And they say I'm in good shape.
*  OK?
*  But Biden's performance was far from smooth, as he accidentally called Vice President Kamala
*  Harris, Vice President Trump.
*  Look, I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president, until I think
*  she was not qualified to be president.
*  So let's start there.
*  Number one, the fact is that the consideration is that I think I'm the most qualified person
*  to run for president.
*  I beat him once, and I will beat him again.
*  Just hours earlier at the NATO summit, Biden mistakenly referred to the Ukrainian president
*  Zelensky as President Putin, as the three-day NATO summit came to a close.
*  And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he
*  has determination.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin.
*  President Putin.
*  He's going to beat President Putin.
*  President Zelensky.
*  I'm so focused on beating Putin.
*  Three more House Democrats called on President Biden to step aside following the news conference.
*  In more news from the NATO summit, the U.S. approved a new $225 million military aid package
*  for Ukraine, including a Patriot missile system.
*  Ukrainian President Zelensky again urged NATO allies to lift all restrictions on Ukraine's
*  use of long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia, saying the move would be a
*  game-changer.
*  Meanwhile, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez criticized NATO's double standard when it
*  comes to support for Ukraine versus Gaza.
*  What Spain has done has been to demand for Ukraine, as well as for Gaza, the same manner
*  and the same firmness in respecting international law.
*  I believe that our strength lies in our unity and also in our coherence.
*  We cannot and should not allow ourselves to be accused by anyone of having double standards
*  in the defense of international law.
*  In May, Spain formally recognized the state of Palestine.
*  In related news, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban traveled to meet with Donald
*  Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort Thursday after leaving the NATO summit in Washington.
*  Orban, who also visited President Putin in Moscow, as well as Beijing in recent weeks,
*  says he's on a, quote, peace mission, 5.0.
*  In Gaza, rescue workers are recovering dozens of dead bodies following two days of nonstop
*  Israeli attacks in Western Gaza City, much of which has now been left in ruins.
*  Survivors say their buildings were attacked in the middle of the night.
*  One man, Musa al-Datdu, says his family was forced from their shelter in the middle of
*  the night by Israeli forces.
*  My mother's in a wheelchair, my wife as well, and she has metal support in her arms and
*  legs.
*  My grandson is paralyzed in the legs.
*  His father had to carry him on his back.
*  In more news from Gaza, at least 70 media organizations are urging Israel to give reporters
*  unfettered access to the besieged territory.
*  Media outlets, including The Associated Press, BBC, CNN, The Guardian, New York Times and
*  The Washington Post, said in a letter, quote,
*  "...the effective ban on foreign reporting has placed an impossible and unreasonable
*  burden on local reporters to document a war through which they are living.
*  More than a hundred journalists have been killed since the start of the war, and those
*  who remain are working in conditions of extreme deprivation," the newspapers wrote.
*  In Israel, the first results of the military's investigation into its response to the October
*  7th attack by Hamas were published Thursday.
*  The report finds the military was unprepared for the incursion into Kibbutz Be'edi and
*  was slow and disorganized in its response.
*  Over a hundred Israelis were killed and over 30 taken hostage from Be'edi.
*  The report, however, denied that hostages killed during a standoff between Hamas and
*  Israeli soldiers were killed in friendly fire, as some have suggested, though it did
*  not offer evidence that Hamas killed them.
*  Members of Kibbutz Be'edi expressed dissatisfaction with the military assessment.
*  We know what are the conclusions.
*  Some conclusions, but not like the big picture conclusion, and what could have done differently
*  and what they are going to do on the next step.
*  How can we feel secure again, safe again?
*  How can we come back to live in Kibbutz Be'edi?
*  In Texas, one million people in the Houston area remain without power and water after
*  Hurricane Beryl slammed into the region Monday amidst a protracted heat wave.
*  Hospitals report a surge in patients with heat-related conditions and are unable to
*  swiftly discharge patients if they don't have electricity at home to stay cool.
*  Extreme heat has killed at least 28 people in the United States over the past week, most
*  of those in California, where wildfires have burned five times the average area this year,
*  according to state officials.
*  Las Vegas recently reported a new record high of 120 degrees Fahrenheit and is on a record-breaking
*  streak of at least six straight days of temperatures topping 115 degrees.
*  Last week, the Biden administration proposed a new rule that would require employers to
*  provide regular rest breaks and water to workers during high temperatures.
*  The rule, which is facing opposition from industry and Republicans, could offer relief
*  to some 500,000 agricultural workers and over 4 million construction workers nationwide,
*  many of whom are immigrants.
*  In Nepal, over 60 people are missing after landslides swept two buses into a river earlier
*  today.
*  Over 90 people have been killed in monsoon-triggered landslides and floods in Nepal over the past
*  month.
*  In Kenya, President William Ruto has fired nearly all his Cabinet members amid continued
*  unrest and two weeks after Ruto scrapped a highly tax bill—a highly contested tax bill
*  following mass protests.
*  At least 41 people were killed as police violently cracked down on demonstrations.
*  On Thursday, the Kenya Human Rights Commission called on Ruto to prosecute security chiefs
*  responsible for the killings.
*  In Saudi Arabia, a man has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for charges related
*  to his social media activity.
*  Asad Al-Ghamdi, a 47-year-old teacher, was arrested in November, convicted of publishing
*  false information and quote, challenging the religion and justice of the king and the crown
*  prince, unquote.
*  He was held in Kamenakato, placed in solitary confinement in a Jeddah prison.
*  He's also been denied medical attention for his epilepsy, suffering multiple seizures
*  in the past.
*  While in custody, according to Human Rights Watch, one of his brothers was sentenced to
*  death last year over his tweets, some of which called for the release of political prisoners.
*  In the United Arab Emirates, over 40 lawyers, academics and political dissidents were sentenced
*  to between 10 years to life in prison this week.
*  Following a mass trial, human rights groups are denouncing as a sham.
*  More than 80 people were tried, many of whom had already been convicted years ago and were
*  serving prison sentences for the same or similar offenses.
*  Human Rights Watch said the proceedings were marred by serious due process and fair trial
*  violations, including the use of torture.
*  Back in the United States, a federal court has ruled that Black Lives Matter activist
*  Dere McEsson cannot be held responsible for injuries inflicted by someone else while attending
*  a protest that McEsson had organized following the 2016 police killing of Alton Sterling
*  in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
*  The ruling came after the U.S. Supreme Court in April declined to take the case.
*  The ACLU hailed Thursday's decision in favor of McEsson as a crucial win for the First
*  Amendment right to protest.
*  And reproductive rights advocates vowed to challenge a move by Arkansas Secretary of
*  State John Thurston, who on Wednesday disqualified a grassroots ballot initiative that seeks
*  to enshrine abortion access in Arkansas's Constitution.
*  Thurston argued the group behind the proposed ballot amendment, Arkansans for Limited Government,
*  failed to identify paid canvassers tossing 14,000 of the more than 100,000 signatures
*  collected.
*  Voters in nearly a dozen states could see abortion-related amendments on the ballot
*  in November.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
