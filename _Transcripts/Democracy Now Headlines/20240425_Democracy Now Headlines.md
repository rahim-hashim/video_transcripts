# Top U.S. & World Headlines — April 25, 2024
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [April 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9B_nhJSNAA)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  President Biden signed the $95 billion military spending package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan
*  Wednesday after months of congressional wrangling.
*  Biden said weapons would flow into Ukraine within hours and declared, quote, it's a
*  good day for world peace.
*  The spending package includes $26 billion and more funding for Israel, which has now
*  killed over 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza in just over six months.
*  Fourteen thousand of them are children, according to official numbers.
*  The true toll is likely much higher as thousands remain missing or trapped under rubble.
*  Israel announced Wednesday it's readying two reserve brigades ahead of its expected
*  ground invasion of Rafah, which the U.S. has publicly opposed.
*  As Biden signed off on sending more arms to Israel, an independent task force released
*  a report showing Israel's use of U.S.-provided weapons violates international humanitarian
*  law.
*  The task force was co-chaired by Palestinian-American legal expert Noura Erekat and Josh Paul,
*  who resigned from the State Department over the Biden administration's support for Israel's
*  war on Gaza.
*  The World Food Program warned this week widespread famine is approaching amidst the ongoing assault
*  and obstruction of aid.
*  We estimate 30 percent of children below the age of two is now acutely malnourished or
*  wasted, and 70 percent of the population in the north is facing catastrophic hunger.
*  There is reasonable evidence that all three famine thresholds—food insecurity and malnutrition
*  mortality—will be passed in the next six weeks.
*  This comes as more horrifying details emerge about three mass graves found at the decimated
*  Nasser Hospital in Chanyounes.
*  Rescue workers have uncovered nearly 400 bodies, including children, with some victims appearing
*  to have been executed or buried alive.
*  We'll have more on this after headlines.
*  Amidst fears of a wider Middle East conflict, the Norwegian Refugee Council's chief, Jan
*  Egland, is warning Lebanon is, quote, on the brink of imploding.
*  Over 90,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in southern Lebanon amidst daily
*  cross-border attacks between Hezbollah and the Israeli army since October 7.
*  Human protests against Israel's war on Gaza are continuing to spread across U.S. campuses
*  despite an intensifying police crackdown.
*  In Los Angeles, police in riot gear arrested 93 people after students at the University
*  of Southern California began an occupation of USC's Alumni Park to call for USC to
*  divest from Israel.
*  Students at other schools have shown incredible bravery, incredible strength in continuing
*  their occupations in the face of incredible repression from their universities, and we
*  will do the same as well.
*  And also, more importantly, the people of Palestine have continued, the people of Gaza
*  have continued to show incredible, incredible determination and strength and resilience
*  in their fight for liberation against the Israeli regime, against the genocide that
*  they are experiencing.
*  And so we hope to embody the same spirit of resistance.
*  The USC protests came a week after the school canceled the commencement speech by the valedictorian
*  Asna Tabassum, who'd expressed support for Palestinians.
*  USC has since canceled all outside speakers at this year's ceremonies.
*  At the University of Texas Austin, school officials called in local and state police
*  who violently crushed a student attempt to set up an encampment on the university's
*  South Mall.
*  At least 50 people were arrested, including at least one journalist.
*  Some faculty at UT Austin are going on strike today to protest the student arrests.
*  In a statement, the teachers wrote, quote,
*  We have witnessed police punching a female student, knocking over a legal observer, dragging
*  a student over a chain-link fence, and violently arresting students simply for standing at
*  the front of the crowd, unquote.
*  In Massachusetts, police made at least 108 arrests as officers broke up a student encampment
*  at Emerson College in Boston overnight.
*  Meanwhile, students at Harvard University defied school orders and began a tent encampment
*  at Harvard Yard, which has been closed since Tuesday.
*  And earlier this morning, police moved in and started arresting Princeton students as
*  they were setting up their own Gaza Solidarity encampment.
*  On Wednesday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson faced heckling and booze when he visited
*  Columbia University.
*  Johnson called for Biden to send in the National Guard to bring order to the campus where
*  students set up the Gaza Solidarity encampment last week.
*  Johnson also called for Columbia President Manu Shafik to step down.
*  Columbia and Barnard students criticized Johnson's visit.
*  What makes us scared or threatened is the president bring NYPD to our campus, is the
*  people like him to bring the National Guard to our campus.
*  We don't need that.
*  That is the thing that makes us feel scared and threatened.
*  We'll have more on the student protests later in the show.
*  The U.S. Supreme Court appeared deeply divided as it heard arguments Wednesday on Idaho's
*  near-total abortion ban.
*  The Biden administration argues Idaho's law violates the Emergency Medical Treatment
*  and Active Labor Act by only providing emergency abortion care when a patient is facing death.
*  This is U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelager.
*  Women in Idaho today are not getting treatment.
*  They are getting airlifted out of the state to Salt Lake City and to neighboring states
*  where there are health exceptions in their laws because the doctors are facing mandatory
*  minimum two years in prison, loss of their license, criminal prosecution.
*  The doctors can't provide the care because until they can conclude that a prosecutor
*  looking over their shoulder won't second-guess that maybe it wasn't really necessary to
*  prevent death.
*  The court's ruling will have major implications for at least half a dozen other states with
*  similar bans.
*  As arguments were delivered, protesters rallied outside the Supreme Court against the Idaho
*  ban.
*  It clearly states that women don't matter, that the fetus they carry matters more.
*  They're conduits instead of people.
*  They're not even given proper access to health treatment and health care that they require.
*  The Supreme Court is taking up another major case today as it considers Donald Trump's
*  claims of immunity against criminal prosecution.
*  In more abortion news, the Arizona House on Wednesday repealed the 1864 near-total abortion
*  ban just two weeks after Arizona's Supreme Court revived the Civil War era law.
*  Democrats were joined by three House Republicans.
*  The repeal must now pass the Arizona Senate before Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs can
*  sign it, which would reinstate Arizona's 2022 law, which bans abortions after 15 weeks
*  of pregnancy.
*  Yolanda Bejarano, chair of the Arizona Democratic Party, spoke following yesterday's vote.
*  The stakes in this election cycle could not be higher and the contrast between our two
*  parties could not be clearer.
*  Democrats are fighting for abortion rights.
*  We are fighting to protect Arizona values.
*  The Republican Party is taking away our rights and are under sole control of Donald Trump.
*  Nine other news from Arizona.
*  A grand jury indicted former President Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, lawyer Rudy
*  Giuliani and 16 others for plotting to use fake electors in Arizona to overturn Trump's
*  2020 election loss.
*  Meanwhile, in Michigan, a pretrial hearing revealed Trump, Meadows and Giuliani were
*  unindicted co-conspirators in the Michigan attorney general's case against fake electors.
*  Others say all three men directly participated in a plot to replace Michigan's electoral
*  votes for Biden with electoral votes for Trump.
*  In Iran, a court is sentenced hip-hop artist, Tumaj Salehi, to death for supporting the
*  2022 popular uprising in his songs.
*  Tumaj Salehi, who is already serving a six-year jail sentence, is appealing the ruling.
*  In related news, rights groups are sounding the alarm over escalating attacks by security
*  forces on women who are out in public without a hijab.
*  Arrested women have reported physical, verbal and sexual attacks by Iranian authorities.
*  TikTok says it'll challenge legislation signed by President Biden yesterday, which
*  forces TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest from its U.S. operations
*  or be banned.
*  Journalists and critics have described the ban as a form of censorship fueled by anti-Chinese
*  sentiment.
*  This is TikTok CEO, Shouji Chu, addressing the app's users on TikTok.
*  And back here in New York, 33 climate activists were arrested Wednesday after shutting down
*  Citigroup's global headquarters to demand the bank stop funding fossil fuels.
*  Activists blockaded every entrance to the building.
