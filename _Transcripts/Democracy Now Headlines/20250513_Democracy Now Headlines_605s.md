We speak with 22-year-old Palestinian journalist Abubaker Abed in Ireland after he evacuated Gaza last month suffering from malnutrition and under threat for his reporting on Israel's genocide. Abed describes himself as an "accidental war correspondent" and hoped to become a sports journalist and commentator before the start of the war, but spent much of the last two years reporting on daily death and destruction. He says leaving Gaza was "a very agonizing decision" for him and that he feels tremendous guilt for now having access to food, water and medicine while so many Palestinians continue to suffer. "I can't really tell you that I'm safe here. I'm probably a physical survivor, but not an emotional survivor. The images that I took with me from Gaza are still haunting me," says Abed. "My whole family is still in Gaza, my friends, my colleagues. And all of them, I'm just thinking about them every single second all day."

*  His new piece for DropSite News has headlined the unbearable pain of leaving Gaza. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=38.36s)]
*  Aboubakar, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=44.04s)]
*  We last spoke to you in Gaza. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  Now you're in Dublin. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=49.6s)]
*  Talk about that journey that you took and your thoughts as you listen to another report [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=51.6s)]
*  from Gaza City, a report that you might have given several months ago. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, thank you so much, Amy, for having me. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=65.72s)]
*  Of course, it's a veryâ€”it's been a very agonizing decision, a very heartbreaking one. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=71.76s)]
*  Let me just say first that everyone in Gaza should have this chance to get the treatment. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=77.44s)]
*  Everyone in Gaza should have the right to continue their education. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=83.24s)]
*  I'm not better than anyone inside Gaza at the moment. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=86.4s)]
*  But yes, for a 22-year-old to take such a decision at such a time in a very, very young [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=90.56s)]
*  age is absolutely traumatizing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=96.64s)]
*  I was forced to it because at that time I was very malnourished, and if I stayed because [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=99.4s)]
*  of the blockade and we heard the report and the ongoing starvation and blockade of every [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=105.16s)]
*  corner of the Gaza Strip is just lethal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=111.64s)]
*  So if I stayed, I would die. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  All Gaza right now is starving. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=116.64s)]
*  So I was left with no choice. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  And this wasn't all the reason, to be honest, because at the same time it was threatened [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  multiple times. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=125.32s)]
*  Yesterday, the Israeli war planes bombed the Burns Ward inside the hospital killing journalist [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=126.32s)]
*  Hagan Aslayeh. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=132.28s)]
*  He's literally the most famous, renowned journalist inside Gaza. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=133.28s)]
*  Everyone really learned from him. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=138.64s)]
*  I learned from him. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=140.6s)]
*  And he brought journalism to Gaza. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=142.2s)]
*  He's been covering Gaza since 2009, three years after the blockade or the siege that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  Israel imposed on the territory. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=149.64s)]
*  So when you look at the number of journalists killed in Gaza, more than 215, and I was, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=152.0s)]
*  I'm very unfortunate to have survived. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=159.24s)]
*  But again, I don't, everyone deserves this chance. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=161.52s)]
*  Everyone should have the right to education, to health, to everything. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  But I can't really tell you that I'm safe here. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=170.12s)]
*  I'm probably a physical survivor, but not an emotional survivor. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=173.64s)]
*  The images that he took with me from Gaza are still haunting me all the night. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  And I can tell you, like over the past three weeks since arriving here, many nights I didn't [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=182.96s)]
*  sleep at all because every place, every beautiful place I visited here in Dublin or around [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=187.68s)]
*  Ireland, it was, I had that secondary instant idea that this place would be bombed and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=193.28s)]
*  I would see it lying in ruins, even the home where I'm residing right now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=200.12s)]
*  So the trauma is relentless and my whole family is still in Gaza, my friends, my colleagues [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  and all of them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=210.8s)]
*  I'm just thinking about them every single second all day. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=211.8s)]
*  And this shouldn't be, again, this shouldn't be the life of a 22-year-old. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  And I didn't want to make this decision. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=219.88s)]
*  I wanted to stay. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=221.48s)]
*  But when a son hears from his mom that, telling him that he is going to harm his own family [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=223.48s)]
*  and harm her, your home country is no longer your home. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=232.2s)]
*  You have to flee, you have to leave because your mom thinks you are a danger, your family [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=236.11999999999998s)]
*  thinks you are a danger. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=241.01999999999998s)]
*  And everyone felt that I was going to be the next target. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=242.36s)]
*  And myself, I knew that I was going to be the next target. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=246.4s)]
*  So when you're put under such circumstances, this is just an unfair word and filled with [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=250.72000000000003s)]
*  corruption that no one can really describe. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=258.08000000000004s)]
*  So this is just a very traumatizing and agonizing decision and I don't know what to say anymore. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=262.68s)]
*  If you can talk about what it is like to watch the news outside about what's happening [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=269.64s)]
*  inside and what is happening directly to your family inside now, though you have made it [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  out, Abu Bakr. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=283.32s)]
*  It's unfair, it's traumatizing and I constantly live in fear just thinking about my family. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=288.84s)]
*  I try to have some joy here but it's painful joy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=295.72s)]
*  I don't have a taste of any food, I don't have a taste of the pure water that I drink [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=298.96s)]
*  right now. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  I remember the times when I was in Gaza, I was drinking contaminated water coming from [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  the sewage and it was really causing me a lot of pain. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=309.32s)]
*  But right now even, when you think about it, that someone has been taken from hell to heaven, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  it's really hard to process. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=317.56s)]
*  And you know, I'm not there anymore. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=319.72s)]
*  So if I, I don't know, but if anyone, like for example I should have been today with [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=322.04s)]
*  the other journalists, Moun Didet, our colleague, our brave colleague Hassan Slay, who was deliberately [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=327.88s)]
*  assassinated by Israel and the killing spree continues to grow every single day towards [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=332.92s)]
*  journalists. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=339.36s)]
*  So I should have been there but I'm watching right now in silence, surrounded by fear, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=340.86s)]
*  by fury, by wrath. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=346.88s)]
*  I really want to do something and I'm trying to do something from here, to try and tell [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=348.76s)]
*  the governments, to the people that we need to do something because this is not, I mean [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=352.64s)]
*  this is not some sort of aberration. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  This is deliberate genocide, starvation by design, an act to try and wipe out the entire [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=359.04s)]
*  Gaza population from the young to the elderly because we've seen the systematic rage of [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=365.76s)]
*  entire families in Gaza, more than, as it has been reported, more than 1200 families [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=372.6s)]
*  have been wiped out. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=379.36s)]
*  And one week before leaving Gaza, my aunt's family was killed, was pumped, sorry, and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  my cousin was 45 years old, her husband was killed, she was killed and now all of her [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=385.82000000000005s)]
*  60 children. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=391.36s)]
*  So all of the family was wiped out. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=392.48s)]
*  Now their memories, their home, everything about them has now been, is now erased because [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=395.04s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=401.06s)]
*  Because Israel continues bombing Palestinians. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=402.06s)]
*  I can't really, I'm praying every single day that a ceasefire would be achieved, an [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=404.66s)]
*  agreement would be hashed out, but I'm trying to do something from here, but I can't tell [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=408.5s)]
*  you anything, but I feel very guilty for the water they drink, for the fresh food that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=413.34s)]
*  I have, for the good medications. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=417.78000000000003s)]
*  Even I'm taking right now gastro-resistant pills and paracetamols and just other multivitamins [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=420.14s)]
*  These are just simple medications that I should have had in Gaza, but right now I'm taking [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=429.21999999999997s)]
*  these simple medications that I was forced to get out just to continue my education and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=434.04s)]
*  take these medications, very simple medications. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=439.12s)]
*  So what is the objective that Israel is trying to achieve by blocking the entry of aid, food [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  and medications into Gaza? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=448.28s)]
*  This is just the peak of terrorism that Israel is doing and the hell that Israel has inflicted [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=450.4s)]
*  upon Palestinians, particularly the children, given the fact that half of the population [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=456.14s)]
*  is the children, this hell is just unprecedented in the conditions. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=460.5s)]
*  As I'm talking to my family and I'm hearing the bombings from abroad, I was hearing them [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=465.97999999999996s)]
*  in Gaza, I feel very frightened, very terrified and I can't really have a good moment of [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=469.58s)]
*  safety here. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=477.14s)]
*  I'm not safe. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=478.14s)]
*  I'm just a physical survivor. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=479.14s)]
*  Finally, I'm speaking to you as President Trump is in his first major international [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=482.85999999999996s)]
*  trip. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=489.02s)]
*  It's to Saudi Arabia. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=490.02s)]
*  It's to the United Arab Emirates. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=491.7s)]
*  It's to Qatar, Qatar, which has been a country that is negotiating supposedly a deal between [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=493.85999999999996s)]
*  Hamas and Israel, of course, with U.S. involvement. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=501.82s)]
*  What message do you have to these countries? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=505.91999999999996s)]
*  That is enough. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=512.86s)]
*  It's enough. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=514.54s)]
*  We're not a party to this war and this is something I told you while I was in Gaza. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=515.54s)]
*  We're not a party to this war. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=518.42s)]
*  We didn't do anything to be suffering that way, that all the Palestinians right now trapped [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=521.5s)]
*  in the territory are still suffering every single day. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWmWbcujdSk&t=527.18s)]
