# “What to the Slave Is the 4th of July?”: James Earl Jones Reads Frederick Douglass’s Historic Speech
**Democracy Now Headlines:** [July 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtfZBV0aJ3M)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Today in this special broadcast, we begin with the words of Frederick Douglass.
*  Born into slavery around 1818, Douglass became a key leader of the abolitionist movement.
*  On July 5, 1852, in Rochester, New York, Frederick Douglass gave one of his most famous speeches,
*  What to the Slave is Your Fourth of July.
*  He was addressing the Rochester Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society.
*  This is James Earl Jones reading the historic address during a performance of Voices of
*  a People's History of the United States.
*  It was co-edited by Howard Zinn.
*  The late great historian introduced the address.
*  Frederick Douglass, once a slave, became a brilliant and powerful leader of the anti-slavery
*  movement in 1852, who was asked to speak in celebration of the Fourth of July.
*  Fellow citizens, pardon me and allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here today?
*  What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence?
*  Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice embodied in that Declaration
*  of Independence extended to us?
*  And am I therefore called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar and
*  to confess the benefits of the Declaration of Independence?
*  And express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us?
*  I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary.
*  Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us.
*  The blessings in which you this day rejoice are not enjoyed in common.
*  The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity, and independence bequeathed by
*  your fathers is shared by you, not by me.
*  The sunlight that brought life and healing to you has brought stripes and death to me.
*  This Fourth of July is yours, not mine.
*  You may rejoice, I must mourn.
*  To drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty and call upon him to join
*  you in joyous anthems wherein human mockery and sacrilegious irony.
*  Do you mean, citizens, to mock me by asking me to speak today?
*  What to the American slave is your Fourth of July?
*  I answer, a day that reveals to him more than all other days of the year the gross injustice
*  and cruelty to which he is a constant victim.
*  To him, your celebration is a sham.
*  Your boasted liberty, an unholy license, your national greatness, swelling vanity,
*  your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless, your denunciation of tyrants, brass-fronted
*  impudence.
*  Your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery.
*  Your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity
*  are to him mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety and hypocrisy.
*  A thin veil to cover up crimes that would disgrace a nation of savages.
*  There's not a nation of the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than other
*  people of these United States at this very hour.
*  At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument is needed.
*  Oh, had I the ability and could reach the nation's ear, I would today be a man of the
*  sea, pour forth a stream, a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering
*  sarcasm and stern rebuke.
*  For it is not light that is needed, but fire.
*  It is not the gentle shower, but thunder.
*  We need the storm, the whirlwind, the earthquake.
*  The feeling of the nation must be quickened.
*  The conscience of the nation must be roused.
*  The propriety of the nation must be startled.
*  The hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed and the crimes against God and man must be
*  proclaimed and denounced.
