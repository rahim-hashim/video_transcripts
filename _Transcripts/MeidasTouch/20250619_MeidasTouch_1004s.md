# Trump GOES NUTS in Public in AM as WAR GETS WORSE
**MeidasTouch:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY)
*  That explosion right there was in the center of Tel Aviv. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran's ballistic missiles were able to hit a lot of their targets in Israel during the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=9.44s)]
*  morning hours, resulting in a lot of deaths in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=15.96s)]
*  The Israeli stock exchange was hit. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=20.12s)]
*  A lot of residential buildings were hit. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  A hospital was hit in southern Israel. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=25.0s)]
*  What's Donald Trump talking about? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  While all of this is taking place, he's talking about poll numbers. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=29.96s)]
*  This is what Donald Trump posted at 6 a.m. in the morning with all of the news breaking [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=34.52s)]
*  that it appears the United States is potentially moments away from officially going to war [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=40.0s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=46.58s)]
*  I shouldn't say officially in the sense that it would be unauthorized not going through [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=47.58s)]
*  that Donald Trump is going to be sending aircrafts to potentially attack potential nuclear sites [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=52.92s)]
*  in Iran or sites capable of developing nuclear weapons as being alleged by the Trump regime. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=61.0s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump is talking about. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=68.4s)]
*  Here's what he's posting on his social media. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=70.8s)]
*  The Crooked Fox News polls got the election wrong. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=73.2s)]
*  I won by much more than they said I would and have been biased against me for years. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=77.04s)]
*  They're always wrong and negative. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=82.12s)]
*  It's why MAGA hates Fox News. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=84.04s)]
*  Even though their anchors are great, this has gone on for years, but they never changed [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  the incompetent polling company that does their work. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=90.56s)]
*  Now a new Fox News poll comes out this morning, giving me little more than 50% at the border, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=93.84s)]
*  and yet the border is miraculously perfect. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  Nobody was able to come in last month. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=103.48s)]
*  60,000 people came in with Sleepy Joe in the same month last year. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=105.8s)]
*  I hate fake pollsters, one of the worst, but Fox will never change their discredited pollsters. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=109.8s)]
*  So Donald Trump's approval in that poll is around 45%. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=115.92s)]
*  In the Quinnipiac, YouGov, and AP polls, it's in the 30% range, 38 to 40% range. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=120.6s)]
*  When it comes to the border, Donald Trump on that Fox poll was around 50%, but when [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=128.92s)]
*  it comes to Donald Trump's deportations of hardworking migrants, Donald Trump is significantly [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=133.6s)]
*  underwater there as well. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=140.64s)]
*  Donald Trump's deportations are grossly unpopular as Donald Trump is targeting restaurants and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  factories and Home Depot parking lots and courthouses and going after people who are [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  not committing crimes. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=155.04s)]
*  While Donald Trump is posting about his poll numbers and the White House is bragging about [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=157.28s)]
*  two gigantic flag polls that they put up on the North and South lawn of the White House, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=163.44s)]
*  CBS is reporting that Donald Trump has been briefed on the risks and benefits of bombing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=170.32s)]
*  the Fordow nuclear facility in Iran and that Donald Trump's mindset is to commit United [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=177.48s)]
*  States troops. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=184.68s)]
*  We need more clarity. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=186.6s)]
*  We need more information. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=188.32s)]
*  This would be a time when a leader would address the nation and tell everybody what is going [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=190.12s)]
*  on. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=195.12s)]
*  Is the goal to stop the nuclear program? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=196.12s)]
*  Well, then why did Donald Trump pull us out of Obama's nuclear deal that stopped the nuclear [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=199.72s)]
*  program? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=204.76s)]
*  Why did Donald Trump's director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, say less than [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=205.88s)]
*  90 days ago before Congress that the intelligence the United States had was that Iran is not [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  capable of making a nuclear weapon? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=216.12s)]
*  Is our goal to stop Iran from having a nuclear weapon or is the goal regime change? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=219.0s)]
*  Because all I hear now on Fox and from MAGA, regime change, regime change, regime change. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=224.64s)]
*  And look, I think that the Ayatollah and the Iranian regime is horrific. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=230.2s)]
*  I would certainly like to see a regime that supports not what they're doing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=235.76s)]
*  I'd like to see a democracy in Iran. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=241.56s)]
*  However, what I don't want to see in the region is a bloody civil war. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't want to see an endless American war. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=248.4s)]
*  I don't want to see a situation where a civil war spreads in the region. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=251.28s)]
*  And before you know, America is in an endless war with tens of thousands of our troops dying. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=256.12s)]
*  That's what I want to avoid. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=264.0s)]
*  I want clarity in what the hell is going on. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=265.0s)]
*  I don't want to go in the direction of what happened with Iraq. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=267.64s)]
*  WMD this, WMD that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=270.56s)]
*  We're seeing the exact same types of talking points rolled out, but in a very expedited [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=272.52s)]
*  and sloppier fashion even. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=278.44s)]
*  Donald Trump post just moments ago, the Wall Street Journal has no idea what my thoughts [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=280.64s)]
*  are concerning Iran. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  Let me just show you this photo as well, or this video rather. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=288.96s)]
*  This is what Tel Aviv looked like earlier this morning. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=292.68s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  And here you can see the damage to the Soroka Medical Center, the biggest hospital in southern [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=296.04s)]
*  Israel amid the Iranian missile attacks. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=311.0s)]
*  I want to understand and I want to get more data and information about these Iranian missiles, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=315.24s)]
*  missile strikes in Israel and what is actually happening there. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=323.28s)]
*  I feel like a lot of the information coming out from right-wing media is a bunch of propaganda. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  I want to understand what's going on because as if you would turn on any of the cable news, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=334.35999999999996s)]
*  they'll basically say the Ayatollah is about to surrender. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=340.32s)]
*  The Ayatollah, they're sending in missiles and they're hitting targets in Israel and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=343.2s)]
*  it looks like things are getting worse. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  Just observing what's taking place. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=348.96s)]
*  Ayatollah Khomeini, the supreme leader of Iran just posted, and victory comes only from [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  Allah the Almighty, the All-Wise. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=355.76s)]
*  And Almighty God will certainly definitely grant victory to the Iranian nation, to the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=358.56s)]
*  truth and to the side that is in the right, God willing. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=363.64s)]
*  I would like to tell our dear nation that if the enemy senses that you fear them, they [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=367.16s)]
*  won't let go of you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  Continue the very behavior that you have had up to this day. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=373.32s)]
*  Continue this behavior with strength. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=376.0s)]
*  The very fact that the Zionist regime's American friends have entered the scene and are saying [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=377.8s)]
*  such things is a sign of that regime's weakness and inability. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=383.0s)]
*  So that doesn't sound like surrender language to me. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=387.64s)]
*  It sounds like ratcheting up war situations to me. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=390.44s)]
*  Here's what Benjamin Netanyahu said, as Bill Madden says, in a diplomatic way, Netanyahu [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=396.88s)]
*  kind of even called out Trump for spreading the lies to make it look like Trump's been [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=403.92s)]
*  involved in what's happened thus far. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=409.44s)]
*  I want to show you this, but then I need to show you a clip of what India's foreign minister [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=412.16s)]
*  had to say about Donald Trump's lie that he negotiated the ceasefire between India and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=416.88s)]
*  Pakistan. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=422.76s)]
*  First, this is what Netanyahu said on Fox. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=423.76s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=425.6s)]
*  There is a Reuters report just moving saying that President Trump in the last couple of [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=426.88s)]
*  Israeli plan to kill Iran's supreme leader, according to two U.S. officials. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=431.32s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=435.48s)]
*  Actually there's so many false reports of conversations that never happened, and I'm [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=438.08s)]
*  not going to get into that, but I can tell you, I think that we do what we need to do. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=443.44s)]
*  We'll do what we need to do. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=450.28s)]
*  And I think the United States knows what is good for the United States, and I'm just not [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=452.68s)]
*  going to get into that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=456.36s)]
*  Next, this is what India's foreign minister had to say, and I'll show you the side by [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=458.0s)]
*  side here of Donald Trump claiming that the best deal that he's made of his presidency [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=463.32s)]
*  was negotiating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=468.84000000000003s)]
*  India has consistently said that Donald Trump has had nothing to do with that at all. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=473.0s)]
*  It certainly had nothing to do with Donald Trump dangling trade, and the ceasefire was [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=477.0s)]
*  accomplished through bilateral negotiations between India and Pakistan. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  But again, look at this split screen here of what Trump says and what a foreign minister [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=487.0s)]
*  of India has to say. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=491.84s)]
*  Here play this clue. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=493.28s)]
*  I think the deal I'm most proud of is the fact that we're dealing with India, we're [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=494.28s)]
*  dealing with Pakistan, and we were able to stop potentially a nuclear war through trade [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=498.2s)]
*  as opposed through bullets. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=503.68s)]
*  You know, normally they do it through bullets, we do it through trade. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=504.68s)]
*  So I'm very proud of that. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=508.32s)]
*  Prime Minister Modi clearly told President Trump that during this entire episode, there [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=511.8s)]
*  was never any discussion at any level about an India-US trade deal or US mediation between [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=520.12s)]
*  India and Pakistan. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=529.64s)]
*  The discussion to halt military action occurred directly between India and Pakistan through [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=532.32s)]
*  existing channels between both armies and was made at Pakistan's request. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=538.52s)]

*  So like CNN put together this split screen, Tulsi Gabbard testifying in the past 90 days [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=654.52s)]
*  that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, followed by Donald Trump 48 hours ago saying [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=661.12s)]
*  I don't care what she says. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=666.2s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=668.08s)]
*  The IC continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=669.28s)]
*  Kameny has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=673.88s)]
*  How close do you personally think that they were to getting one? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=679.08s)]
*  Because Tulsi Gabbard testified in March that the intelligence community said Iran wasn't [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=682.28s)]
*  building a nuclear weapon. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=688.08s)]
*  I don't care what she said, I think they were very close to having one. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=689.08s)]
*  And here's an important thing that I think is not getting enough attention. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=692.88s)]
*  America did not prevail against the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=697.84s)]
*  Remember the operation against the Houthis that Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump were bragging [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=702.4s)]
*  about, right? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=707.56s)]
*  The signal text messages that Hegseth and Donald Trump's former national security advisor, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=709.0799999999999s)]
*  Mike Wallace, by the way, who's a new national security advisor? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=716.48s)]
*  Who were the people in charge? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=719.4399999999999s)]
*  Remember they were on signal and they were talking about striking the Houthis. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=721.9599999999999s)]
*  And remember Hegseth said that wasn't classified information and it doesn't matter anyway because [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=726.76s)]
*  it was a successful operation. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=731.68s)]
*  The point of the operation, if there was one, was to ensure safe passage of commercial vessels [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=734.12s)]
*  through the Red Sea, right? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=741.88s)]
*  That's why there was the operation. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=743.96s)]
*  The Houthis were preventing commercial vessels from going there and that was adding a ton [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=745.8s)]
*  to the cost of trade because you have to go around the Red Sea. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=751.6s)]
*  So that was one of the issues. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=756.04s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=759.54s)]
*  Commercial vessels still aren't going through the Red Sea. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=762.38s)]
*  The Houthis hit two F-18 Hornets, seven Reaper drones costing literally hundreds of millions [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=764.9599999999999s)]
*  of dollars and then Trump entered into a ceasefire with the Houthis. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=772.8199999999999s)]
*  And then the Houthis are laughing that they beat the United States in an operation. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=777.54s)]
*  America couldn't beat the Houthis. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=782.42s)]
*  Now, if you watch cable news, you would not know that. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=783.54s)]
*  America did not beat the Houthis in the operation and that the Houthis essentially won. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=787.26s)]
*  No one talks about that. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=792.14s)]
*  But let me just show you the facts. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=793.3s)]
*  Here is Democratic Congress member Moulton cross-examining Pete Hegseth about just that. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=795.62s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=801.66s)]
*  You talked about the success of the Houthi operation. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=802.66s)]
*  About how much money did it cost? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=805.66s)]
*  How much money did you spend on missiles shooting at the Houthis? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=806.86s)]
*  Well you'd have to compare that with what it cost. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=810.38s)]
*  I'm just asking how much did it cost? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=812.46s)]
*  It hurt our shipping lanes around. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=813.74s)]
*  I'm told it's several hundred million dollars, maybe close to a billion dollars. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=815.02s)]
*  How many U.S. flagged commercial ships have transited the Red Sea since your so-called [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=818.8199999999999s)]
*  successful operation? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=822.5s)]
*  Well thankfully, unlike the previous administration, the answer is zero. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=824.42s)]
*  Military vessels transited. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=828.38s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=829.38s)]
*  I didn't ask about military vessels. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=830.38s)]
*  I asked about commercial vessels. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=831.38s)]
*  Well, which would be the precursor for a million commercial vessels. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=832.38s)]
*  It's been several weeks. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=834.86s)]
*  How many commercial vessels U.S. flagged have transited the Red Sea? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=835.86s)]
*  Would you, Mr. Congressman, put civilian ships through the SAM for military ships? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=837.98s)]
*  The questions are not to me, Mr. Secretary. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=840.3s)]
*  They're to you. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=842.1s)]
*  We have responsibly put military ships. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=843.1s)]
*  The answer is zero. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=844.42s)]
*  I reclaim my time. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=845.42s)]
*  Yeah, the answer is zero. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=846.66s)]
*  Zero. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=849.9799999999999s)]
*  Nothing has been done. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=852.18s)]
*  Zero commercial ships have gone through the Red Sea. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=853.18s)]
*  Here was Donald Trump back on May 7th, 2025, announcing a ceasefire with the Houthis and [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=857.66s)]
*  calling the Houthis brave and saying how great they are and what incredible people the Houthis [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=863.78s)]
*  are. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=869.66s)]
*  Ceasefire with the Houthis? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=871.62s)]
*  Is Donald Trump saying a ceasefire with Iran would be weak, unconditional surrender? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=873.38s)]
*  Who even knows what he's saying? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=878.46s)]
*  But here's what Trump said in a press conference on May 7th. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=879.74s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=882.9s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=883.9s)]
*  But, you know, we had really a very good, as you know, we had a very good outcome with [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=884.9s)]
*  the Houthis and we honor their words and they made a commitment and we dealt with other [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=892.34s)]
*  countries that were close to them and their surrogates. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=899.22s)]
*  We honor all of their words. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=903.3s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=904.54s)]
*  But I think, you know, I believe that hopefully that's over with and they'll leave the ships [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=905.9399999999999s)]
*  alone. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=911.6199999999999s)]
*  You know, just leave those ships alone. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=912.6199999999999s)]
*  But so we do, we take their word for it. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=915.54s)]
*  It was, you know, we hit them very hard. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=917.54s)]
*  They had a great capacity to withstand punishment. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=919.8199999999999s)]
*  They took tremendous punishment. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=923.6199999999999s)]
*  And you know, you could say there's a lot of bravery there. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=926.4599999999999s)]
*  It was amazing what they took. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=930.38s)]
*  But we honor their commitment and their word. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=934.26s)]
*  They gave us their word that they wouldn't be shooting ships anymore. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihxRTyOesVY&t=936.34s)]
