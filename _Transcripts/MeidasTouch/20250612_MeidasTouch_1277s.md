*  He's been out of order six times. He's trying to get on MSNBC. You probably knocked somebody off. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  I don't have any problem getting on MSNBC. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=69.44s)]

*  Back to order Ms. Green. Go. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=75.11999999999999s)]
*  He's a former Antifa member. Mr. Chairman, I'm surprised. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=76.64s)]

*  Yeah, you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=82.72s)]

*  And then you had, again, I said there was a hearing involving Democratic governors. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=101.68s)]
*  You then had New York Democratic Governor Kathy Hockel there. And then Marjorie Taylor Green said, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  are you smiling at me? Stop smiling at me. Play this clip. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=110.4s)]
*  Five to $10 million a day to feed and house. Are you smiling at me about this? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=113.28s)]
*  You look like you got quite a smile on your face. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=118.48s)]
*  No, because I can tell you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Generally will not. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=121.92s)]
*  This is my time reclaiming my time. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=123.92s)]
*  I'm thinking about it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  Don't you dare smile about the murder of her parents. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=127.52s)]
*  The third time. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=131.6s)]
*  Question how I look. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=132.48s)]
*  My heart is breaking for my time. Governor Hockel. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=134.08s)]
*  The third time he was arrested was in the same. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=136.8s)]
*  Then you had Nancy Mace demanding to know of the governor's what a woman is. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=139.12s)]
*  Do you know what a woman is? Am I a woman? She says here. Play this clip. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=144.88s)]
*  $19.90. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=148.48s)]
*  Okay. What is a woman? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=149.68s)]
*  I. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=151.76s)]
*  What is a woman is the question. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  I'm not sure I understand the question here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=158.64s)]
*  What do you want me to say? This is. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=162.48s)]
*  I want you to say that a woman like me is an adult human female that men can't become women. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=165.92s)]
*  You guys are the party of violence and you're the party erasing women. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  You don't respect us. You're a bigot. You're a misogynist. You're a sexist. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=175.51999999999998s)]

*  Play this clip. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=206.16s)]
*  You are responsible for the murder of this little girl, Lakin Riley, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=207.20000000000002s)]

*  And if you support it too, you're responsible for her murder. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=221.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=225.04000000000002s)]

*  Mr. Chairman, these witnesses have been here for over four hours. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=231.12s)]
*  They've all voluntarily have been engaging with our members with respect. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=234.4s)]
*  They've all treated our members with respect. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=239.04s)]
*  Lakin Riley is dead forever. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=241.12s)]
*  I'll rule the decorum. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=243.52s)]
*  Forever. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=244.88s)]
*  They can sit there all day. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=245.6s)]
*  I'm claiming my time. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=248.0s)]
*  I'm claiming my time. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  State your point. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=249.76s)]
*  I'm trying to. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=250.96s)]
*  State your point. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=251.84s)]
*  No, no. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  Let me give it without interruption. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  It's a point of inquiry, not a debate. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=253.6s)]
*  Our rules, if you would let me speak, our rules of decorum dictate that our witnesses [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=255.6s)]
*  should be treated with respect. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=261.92s)]
*  And I ask you to enforce the Coralman Remind Committee members to treat our witnesses with [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=263.36s)]
*  respect. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=268.8s)]
*  Our members are treated with respect. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=269.36s)]
*  That was a common theme. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  The MAGA Republicans in full fascist mode were basically looking at the Democratic [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  governors and just yelling at them and saying, you need to be prosecuted. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=278.8s)]
*  Charges should be brought. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=283.44s)]
*  Here you have Democratic Congresswoman AOC pushing back against the MAGA Republicans [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=284.8s)]
*  and saying, you're just witness intimidation. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=289.36s)]
*  You're just threatening witnesses with arrest. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=292.32s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  False. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=295.44s)]
*  And charges should be for obstruction, should be brought against each one of you for doing [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=295.76s)]
*  this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=301.04s)]
*  I'll leave that up to the Department of Justice. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=301.36s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, I yield back. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=303.04s)]
*  Chair, now recognizes Ms. Crockett from Texas. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=304.64s)]
*  Mr. Chairman. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Chair. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=307.6s)]
*  Point of order. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  Point of order. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=308.56s)]
*  That was intimidation of the witness. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=309.2s)]
*  Do you have a point of inquiry? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=312.32s)]
*  Yes, I have a point of inquiry. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=313.68s)]
*  State your point. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  Raising the prospect of charges against witnesses is a form of intimidation, is it not? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=316.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=325.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=326.0s)]
*  And I withdraw the question. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=326.4s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=327.44s)]
*  Chair recognizes Ms. Crockett. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=328.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=330.56s)]
*  Then you had MAGA Republican Congressmember Mike Lawler from New York almost trying to [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=330.96s)]
*  troll the Democrats by staying on their side and just like standing on their side of the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=336.88s)]
*  House floor. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=344.88s)]
*  And then you have a Democratic Congressmember like just screaming at them like, dude, just [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=346.0s)]

*  to MAGA Republican Congressmember Mary Miller, I'm not going to be lectured by someone who [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=402.4s)]

*  Yes or no, sir? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=416.56s)]
*  You know, Congresswoman Miller, I am not going to be lectured to by somebody who extols the virtue [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=418.24s)]

*  These shirts fit, and I mean actually fit. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=436.88s)]

*  breathable, zero stiffness. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=443.84s)]

*  I wear True Classic running errands, even out to dinner. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=447.2s)]
*  They are that versatile, and I'm not the only one. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=450.24s)]
*  True Classic is blowing up for a reason. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=453.28s)]
*  You're getting premium quality without that designer price tag. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=455.68s)]

*  tell Pritzker that women don't want him in their bathrooms. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=554.32s)]

*  That that's a private space that they don't want you or any other man in? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=562.48s)]

*  You want to take Medicaid away and SNAP and veterans services. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=570.96s)]
*  You apparently want people to die in the United States because you want to take health care away. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=576.32s)]
*  Do you think that's appropriate? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=582.72s)]
*  Sir, if we're going to politicize this, let's talk about what you're doing to people in this country [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=584.72s)]
*  by virtue of your vote with President Trump. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=589.76s)]
*  And you have Democratic Congress member Carbohol to Hegsith over here saying that you're an [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=592.24s)]
*  embarrassment to the country. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=598.48s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=600.08s)]
*  You know what? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=600.8s)]
*  I'm not going to waste my time anymore. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=601.92s)]
*  You're not worthy of my attention or my questions. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=603.4399999999999s)]
*  You're an embarrassment to this country. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=606.8s)]
*  You're unfit to lead. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=608.8s)]
*  And there's been bipartisan members of Congress that have called for your resignation. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=610.4s)]
*  You should just get the hell out and let somebody competently lead this department. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=615.12s)]
*  Here we have Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=621.3599999999999s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=624.64s)]
*  A question to that. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=625.28s)]
*  I know that there's been some conversations about what's going on in LA. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=626.56s)]
*  And they want to say that it's riots because they didn't want people to keep talking about, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=630.24s)]
*  say, the Epstein files or whatever other drama was popping off between the president [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=634.4s)]
*  and his little friend. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=639.44s)]
*  So they wanted to change the conversation to immigration because they feel like, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=640.72s)]
*  well, the polling is in our benefit. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=645.6800000000001s)]
*  But let me tell you something. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=647.92s)]
*  If they cared about making sure we were going to be fiscally responsible, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  they would tell the American people that it cost them $134 million to send the National Guard [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=652.72s)]
*  to LA for the quote unquote riots that the governor didn't ask for, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=660.16s)]
*  nor did the mayor of LA ask for. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=663.76s)]
*  And they sent them over there and they say that they care about our service members, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  yet they sent them and they were laying on the floor. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=669.6s)]
*  They did not provide for food. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  So I don't know why we would believe that, number one, they want to fix this. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=674.24s)]
*  They don't want to fix this because the brokenness is a feature, not a flaw of the system, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=679.36s)]
*  because it is beneficial to them when it comes to campaigning. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=685.4399999999999s)]
*  If they can't stoke fear, then why are they going to say have anybody vote for them? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=689.92s)]
*  Because that's what people are doing. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=696.4799999999999s)]
*  They're voting out of fear. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=697.76s)]
*  Then we have Democratic Congress member Smith to Hegseth play this clip. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=698.56s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm sincerely concerned about this. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=702.4s)]
*  Is it the policy of the Department of Defense that we need to be prepared to take [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=704.64s)]
*  Greenland and Panama by force if necessary? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=710.24s)]
*  Is this a policy that you have within the Department of Defense [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=713.4399999999999s)]
*  in accordance with the president's wishes? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=716.56s)]
*  I heard what you said about those two countries and saying we need to worry about China. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=718.88s)]
*  We are worried about China. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=726.08s)]
*  That wasn't my concern. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=727.36s)]
*  China's malign influence in Panama. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=728.88s)]
*  I was concerned with us saying that using military force to take another [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=730.72s)]
*  side of the country's territory. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=735.12s)]
*  We should pay attention to that. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=736.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=737.36s)]
*  So Panama is very key terrain that we've focused on and we've been willing to focus on, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=737.76s)]
*  as is Greenland. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=741.28s)]
*  We should take it by military force. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=742.24s)]
*  They're important. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=743.92s)]
*  I'm not going to argue with that. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=744.64s)]
*  I'm arguing with using our military to take it by force. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=746.3199999999999s)]
*  Our job at the DOD is to have plans. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=750.3199999999999s)]
*  And do you have a plan for that? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=753.28s)]
*  Our job at the Defense Department is to have plans for any particular contingency. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=755.5999999999999s)]
*  Including the contingency of basically any contingency you need. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=759.76s)]
*  We've got it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=763.1999999999999s)]
*  We've got a building full of planners and we're prepared to give recommendations whenever needed. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=763.76s)]
*  So just be clear. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=767.8399999999999s)]
*  You have plans to take Panama and Greenland by force if necessary. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=769.92s)]
*  I think the American people would want the Pentagon to have plans for any particular contingency. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=773.28s)]
*  Not for that. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=778.48s)]
*  Thankfully, we are in the planning business. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=778.9599999999999s)]
*  Speaking on behalf of the American people, I don't think the American people voted for [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=781.28s)]
*  President Trump because they were hoping we would invade Greenland. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX3aXguNONI&t=785.04s)]
