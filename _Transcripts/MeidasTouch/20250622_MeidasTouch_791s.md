# Trump THROWS Cabinet UNDER THE BUS with NEW WAR PLANS
**MeidasTouch:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0)
*  Donald Trump is having a meltdown on late Sunday afternoon as the strikes on Iran do [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=0.0s)]
*  not seem to have been as successful as he initially claimed. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=6.68s)]
*  He's now posting, make Iran great again, and calling for regime change. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=10.52s)]
*  And this follows earlier today, Donald Trump's Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth saying that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=18.52s)]
*  there is no intention for regime change. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=24.84s)]
*  And then Donald Trump's Vice President J.D. Vance went on the morning shows and said the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=28.64s)]
*  United States is not pursuing regime change. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=34.0s)]
*  But here Donald Trump is saying, MIGA, make Iran great again, and regime change? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=37.56s)]
*  Here's what he posted. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=44.56s)]
*  He goes, it's not politically correct to use the term regime change. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  But if the current Iranian regime is unable to make Iran great again, why wouldn't there [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=51.4s)]
*  be regime change? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=59.26s)]
*  Make Iran great again! [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=62.66s)]
*  As our editor in chief Ron Filipkowski writes, just when the paid MAGA shills got done cranking [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=67.12s)]
*  out 36 hours of post to their divided cult that this was only about nukes and not about [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=74.0s)]
*  regime change, Trump does it again. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=81.24s)]
*  Now this was earlier today when J.D. Vance was on Meet the Press and he says, our view [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=85.24s)]
*  has been very clear and has not changed. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=92.0s)]
*  We don't want regime change. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=95.2s)]
*  Here's J.D. Vance saying at Play This Clip. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  Well look, that's up to the Israelis, but our view has been very clear that we don't [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=102.84s)]
*  want a regime change. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=106.64s)]
*  We do not want to protract this or build this out any more than it's already been built [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=108.36s)]
*  out. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=112.72s)]
*  We want to end their nuclear program and then we want to talk to the Iranians about a long-term [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=113.72s)]
*  settlement here. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=118.04s)]
*  Now here's Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth saying, the mission was not and has never [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  been about regime change, the exact opposite of what Donald Trump just posted. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=125.0s)]
*  Play This Clip. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=130.16s)]
*  So is regime change off the table Mr. Secretary? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=131.96s)]
*  And to the Chairman, you said the battle damage assessment is still ongoing, but do you believe [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=136.12s)]
*  that some nuclear capability in Iran remains? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=142.24s)]
*  This mission was not and has not been about regime change. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  The President authorized a precision operation to neutralize the threats to our national [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=151.56s)]
*  interests posed by the Iranian nuclear program and the collective self-defense of our troops [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=158.56s)]
*  and our ally Israel. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=164.36s)]
*  Now Donald Trump is posting that the, he posted this as well about a half hour ago, the damage [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=166.6s)]
*  to the nuclear sites in Iran is said to be quote monumental. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  The hits were hard and accurate. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=177.76s)]
*  Great skill was shown by our military. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=180.22s)]
*  Thank you exclamation point. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=183.44s)]
*  However, that's not what the intelligence seems to be showing right now. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  It seems that the Fordow complex was not completely destroyed. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=192.2s)]
*  There's also a bunch of messages as well coming out from JD Vance and others like this from [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=197.56s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=204.44s)]
*  JD Vance signals that Iran still controls enriched uranium stockpile. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=205.92s)]
*  So that would seem to undercut everything that Donald Trump is saying there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=213.36s)]
*  Also even Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu says the extent of damages is still [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  to be seen. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  Again, more hedging right there. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=228.52s)]
*  Also this is what CNBC was reporting moments ago. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  US is now calling on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz and disrupting [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=236.04s)]
*  global oil flows. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=244.2s)]
*  So the United States, which was once a superpower, now has to go and beg China's leader Xi Jinping [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=246.96s)]
*  to help stop Iran from disrupting global oil flows. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=255.56s)]
*  So Trump is begging Xi Jinping right now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=261.64s)]
*  That's what is taking place. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=265.18s)]
*  Also Donald Trump is posting the following. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=267.86s)]
*  Just look at the way this visually looks. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=270.78000000000003s)]
*  It looks like a crazy person wrote this. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=274.18s)]
*  And Donald Trump in this message is attacking Thomas Massie of Kentucky. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=277.02s)]
*  And here's what he says. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=282.5s)]
*  Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky is not MAGA, even though he likes to say he is. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=283.98s)]
*  Actually, MAGA doesn't want him, doesn't know him, and doesn't respect him. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=290.38s)]
*  He is a negative force who almost always votes no, no matter how good something may be. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=295.5s)]
*  He's a simple-minded grandstander who thinks it's good politics for Iran to have the highest [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=301.02s)]
*  level nuclear weapon while at the same time yelling death to America at every chance they [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=306.94s)]
*  get. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=311.98s)]
*  Iran has killed and maimed thousands of Americans and even took over the embassy in Tehran under [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=312.98s)]
*  the Carter administration. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=319.62s)]
*  We had a spectacular military success yesterday taking the bomb right out of their hands and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=321.74s)]
*  they would use it if they could. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=327.7s)]
*  But as usual, and despite the praise and accolades received, this lightweight congressman is [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=329.08s)]
*  against what was so brilliantly achieved last night in Iran. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=335.34000000000003s)]
*  Massie is weak, ineffective, and votes no on virtually everything put before him. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=339.54s)]
*  Rand Paul Jr. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=345.38s)]
*  And then Donald Trump goes on and just continues to whine there, but you see, oh you know I [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=347.26s)]
*  had to do it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=352.02s)]
*  Moink. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=353.5s)]
*  Four companies control over 80% of the US meat industry. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=354.5s)]
*  China now controls the largest portion of US pork. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=359.21999999999997s)]
*  These companies are using mobster-like tactics to crush American family farms, and with the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=362.76s)]
*  additives they're putting into our food, Americans are stuck with sketchy meat. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=369.34s)]
*  So what can we do about it? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=374.78s)]
*  Let me tell you about a company that's coming up swinging on behalf of American family farms [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=375.97999999999996s)]
*  and your family's food security. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=381.06s)]
*  It's called Moink. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=383.38s)]
*  As I said at the beginning, Moink Moink. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=384.38s)]
*  The business is simple. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=386.73999999999995s)]
*  Moink's meat comes from animals raised outdoors where a pig is free to be a pig. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=387.97999999999996s)]
*  Their farmers are given an honest day's pay for an honest day's work and they deliver [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=393.38s)]
*  meat straight to your doorstep at prices that you can actually afford. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=397.9s)]
*  Born, raised, and harvested right here in the United States. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=402.38000000000005s)]
*  Support American family farms and join the Moink movement today at moinkbox.com slash [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=406.14000000000004s)]
*  MidasTouch right now and get free wings for life. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=413.3s)]
*  They're the best wings you'll ever taste for free, but for a limited time. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=416.62s)]
*  Here's how you spell it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=420.98s)]
*  M-O-I-N-K box dot com slash MidasTouch. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=422.22s)]
*  That's moinkbox dot com slash MidasTouch. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=428.3s)]
*  He is attacking Republicans for basically reiterating what Donald Trump's campaign position [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=432.17999999999995s)]
*  was, which was no wars in the Middle East. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=440.65999999999997s)]
*  But of course we know that Trump was lying. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=444.02s)]
*  Donald Trump also posted the following. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=447.46s)]
*  He refers to himself as Donnett. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=450.29999999999995s)]
*  He spells his name wrong. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=453.26s)]
*  Here's what he posts. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=454.97999999999996s)]
*  The great B-2 pilots have just landed safely in Missouri. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=456.21999999999997s)]
*  Thank you for a job well done. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=460.5s)]
*  And he spells his name Donnett. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=462.58s)]
*  D-O-N-A-K-D J. Trump, President of the United States. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=464.82s)]
*  And it's just post after post like this looking incredibly, incredibly erratic. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=470.62s)]
*  What other information are we learning right now as well? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=477.34s)]
*  There's something called Pickaxe Mountain. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=480.94s)]
*  That there's another Iran, lesser known, underground nuclear facility that's actually [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=484.06s)]
*  deeper than Fordow, which may have enriched uranium as well. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=490.34s)]
*  There may be a place where there is nuclear capabilities. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=494.9s)]
*  Iran is claiming that they've been able to remove the nuclear capabilities before the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=499.38s)]
*  attack on Fordow. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=504.82s)]
*  Lots of leaders in Iran are claiming that the Trump regime choreographed when the strikes [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=506.82s)]
*  would take place because the Trump regime was hoping it would just be a one-off strike [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=515.1s)]
*  the way they killed Soleimani in 2020 and then that the Trump regime would just move [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=522.14s)]
*  on and that enabled Iran to move some of its weapons or move some of its materials outside [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=528.14s)]
*  of those facilities. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=536.58s)]
*  We also know that Iran's foreign minister is now taking a trip to meet with Vladimir [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=538.78s)]
*  Putin. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=545.5s)]
*  As we speak, he's going to be flying to Russia as part of a defense pact between Russia and [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=546.78s)]
*  Iran that Donald Trump clearly does not or didn't know about or take into account for. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=553.68s)]
*  But if Trump knew basics about politics, he would know that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=559.8199999999999s)]
*  You have Israel Media, Channel 13, reporting the following. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=564.22s)]
*  The Iranian nuclear program cannot be destroyed with bombs even if we attack it for another [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=569.98s)]
*  year with the Americans. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=576.26s)]
*  So it seems as it is becoming more clear that this attack was not as effective as advertised. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=579.14s)]
*  The Trump regime is changing its view on it and now it's regime change and make Iran [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=587.7s)]
*  great again. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=596.38s)]
*  I want to share this with you because this happened a little bit earlier as well where [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=597.38s)]
*  you had Marco Rubio on Face the Nation and he was asked, why would you do this if your [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=602.1s)]
*  intelligence said that Iran couldn't build a nuclear weapon anytime soon? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=608.82s)]
*  And Rubio goes, well, that's irrelevant. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=614.22s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=616.1800000000001s)]
*  Are you saying there that the United States did not see intelligence that the Supreme [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=617.5799999999999s)]
*  Leader had ordered weaponization? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=622.74s)]
*  That's irrelevant. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=627.78s)]
*  I see that question being asked on the media. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=628.78s)]
*  That's an irrelevant question. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=630.54s)]
*  They had everything they needed to build a weapon. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=631.54s)]
*  That is the key point in U.S. intelligence assessments. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=632.54s)]
*  You know that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=634.06s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=635.06s)]
*  Yes, it was. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=636.06s)]
*  That the political decision had not been made. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=637.06s)]
*  I know that better than you know that and I know that that's not the case. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=638.06s)]
*  But I'm asking you whether the order was given. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=640.2199999999999s)]
*  And the people who say that, it doesn't matter if the order was given. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=642.3399999999999s)]
*  They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=645.4599999999999s)]
*  Why would you bury things in a mountain 300 feet under the ground? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=647.38s)]
*  Why would you bury six? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=651.8000000000001s)]
*  Why do they have 60 percent enriched uranium? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=652.8000000000001s)]
*  You don't need 60 percent enriched uranium. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=655.0s)]
*  The only countries in the world that have uranium at 60 percent are countries that have [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=656.52s)]
*  nuclear weapons because they can quickly make it 90. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=660.52s)]
*  They have all the elements. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=663.6s)]
*  They have why do they have a space program? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=664.6s)]
*  Is Iran going to go to the moon? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=666.52s)]
*  No, they're trying to build an ICBM. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=667.76s)]
*  No, but that's a question of intent. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=669.48s)]
*  And you know in the intelligence assessment that it was that Iran wanted to be a threshold [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=672.72s)]
*  saying use this leverage. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=676.96s)]
*  I'm talking about the public March assessment. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=678.88s)]
*  And that's why I was asking you if you know something more from March. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=682.08s)]
*  But that's also an inaccurate representation of it. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=684.64s)]
*  That's an accurate representation of it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=687.2s)]
*  That's not how intelligence is read. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=688.84s)]
*  That's not how intelligence is used. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=690.5400000000001s)]
*  Now, why would that be irrelevant? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=692.24s)]
*  Wouldn't that be most relevant before getting the U.S. into protracted wars in Iran? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=694.08s)]
*  And finally, Donald Trump's been attacking again, MAGA Republican Thomas Massey for basically [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=700.36s)]
*  saying the things that Trump was saying before. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  And here's Thomas Massey this morning on Face the Nation. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=709.24s)]
*  You could see for yourself. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=711.8s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=713.08s)]
*  The speaker of the House who is from your own party has really rejected this. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=714.08s)]
*  He says the Article One power of Congress really allows for the president to do this. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=718.48s)]
*  It was a limited necessary targeted strike, he says. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=723.92s)]
*  Well, he's probably referring to the War Powers Act of 1973, but that's been misinterpreted. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=727.96s)]
*  There was no imminent threat to the United States, which was what would authorize that. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=735.0s)]
*  And I think that's peculiar to hear that from the speaker of the House. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=740.52s)]
*  Look, Congress was on vacation last week when all this was happening. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=743.96s)]
*  You haven't been briefed on any of these things. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=747.6s)]
*  We haven't been briefed. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=748.92s)]
*  They should have called us all back. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=750.12s)]
*  And frankly, we should have debated this War Powers resolution that Ro Khanna and I offered [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=752.24s)]
*  instead of staying on vacation and doing fundraisers and saying, oh, well, the president's got [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=757.04s)]
*  this under control. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=762.46s)]
*  We're going to cede our constitutional authority. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=763.56s)]
*  There you have it, folks. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=766.9599999999999s)]
*  Trump having a afternoon meltdown will keep you posted every step of the way here on the [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=768.04s)]
*  Midas Touch Network. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=772.16s)]
*  Hit subscribe. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=773.76s)]
*  Let's get to six million subscribers. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=774.76s)]
*  Let's keep growing this network together and getting out the truth. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=777.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haRhdCwcm-0&t=780.68s)]
