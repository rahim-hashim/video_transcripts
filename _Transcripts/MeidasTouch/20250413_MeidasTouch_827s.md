*  Which the MAGA Republicans here in the United States called the green new scam and Donald Trump mocked during [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=142.67999999999998s)]

*  Elon Musk apparently was begging begging the Trump regime [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  Not to do these tariffs on China and elsewhere which the Trump regime did not listen all do [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=161.39999999999998s)]
*  Also, we're seeing other members of the Trump cabinet seem to turn against Elon Musk [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=168.0s)]
*  They're also leaking out how annoying they think Elon is how they despise him and how they just want him out and that he's just a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=173.4s)]
*  Very annoying person. Let me share this clip with you where Elon Musk says that he hopes the US and Europe move to a zero [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=181.22s)]
*  Tariff situation really Elon you've enabled this and now you're getting your karma [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=189.24s)]
*  You're just desserts here play this clip and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=196.04s)]
*  I'm hopeful for example with the tariffs that that at the end of the day [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=199.88s)]
*  I hope it is great that both Europe and the United States should move ideally in my view to a zero [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=203.72s)]
*  Tariff situation effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=211.96s)]
*  and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=218.32s)]
*  That that would be my that's what I hope I hope occurs [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=220.88s)]
*  And also more freedom of people to move between Europe and North America [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=226.0s)]
*  If they wish if they wish to work in Europe for wish to work in America [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=231.4s)]
*  They should be allowed to do so in my view [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=235.16s)]
*  So that that has certainly been my advice to the president now [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=239.76s)]
*  There's a feud that has been brewing between Elon Musk and Peter Navarro Peter Navarro is one of Donald Trump's top [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=244.2s)]
*  Economic advisors and Navarro's been going on Fox and making his rounds another right-wing [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=252.0s)]
*  Propaganda media saying that Elon Musk really isn't a car manufacturer [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=258.24s)]
*  He's just a salesman Navarro says he's just someone who sells cars play this clip [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=263.32s)]
*  It was interesting to hear Elon Musk at the beginning talk about his zero tariff zone with Europe [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=269.02s)]
*  He doesn't understand that and the thing that's I think important about Elon to understand he sells cars [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=274.8s)]
*  That's what he does and if you look for example at the Tesla factories in Texas [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=280.14000000000004s)]
*  They're assembly plants and they get a lot of their content from China Mexico Japan [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=285.12s)]
*  And Taiwan and elsewhere so then Elon Musk responded by calling Navarro a moron Navarro is truly a moron [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=291.18s)]
*  What he says here is demonstrably false Tesla has the most American-made cars Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks by any [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=299.18s)]
*  definition whatsoever [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=307.3s)]
*  Tesla is the most vertically integrated auto manufacturer in America with the highest percentage of US content [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=309.3s)]
*  Navarro should ask the fake expert [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=316.46000000000004s)]
*  He invented Ron Vera and then Elon Musk started calling Peter Navarro Peter our [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=318.54s)]
*  Word repeatedly over and over again. This is from that Rolling Stones article that I referenced before which was basically titled [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=324.78000000000003s)]
*  Inside Elon Musk's gleeful destruction of the government. Here's what it says [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=332.98s)]
*  It says the following quote I have been in the same room with Elon and he always tries to be funny [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=338.74s)]
*  And he's not funny like at all says a senior Trump administration official quote [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=343.86s)]
*  He makes these jokes in a little [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  Asides and smiles then looks almost hurt if you don't lap up his humor [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=350.1s)]
*  I keep using the word annoying a lot of people have to deal with him do but the word doesn't do the situation [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=353.94s)]
*  Justice Elon just thinks he's smarter than everyone else in the room and acts like it even when it's clear [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=359.42s)]
*  He doesn't know what he's talking about [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=364.62s)]
*  Musk has not at the patience of an array of high-ranking administration officials to the point that according to the this official and two others [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=366.22s)]
*  Trump lieutenants have walked out of meetings and earnestly asked one another if they thought Musk was high [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=373.54s)]
*  Administration officials joked to one another about subjecting Musk to mandatory drug testing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=379.46s)]
*  Which Musk himself said would be a great idea for federal employees a lawyer for Musk has said that he's regularly and randomly drug-tested at SpaceX [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=385.02s)]
*  And has never failed the test quote [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=392.94s)]
*  Talking to the guy is sometimes like listening to a really rusty nail on a chalkboard [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=395.82s)]
*  Says the senior Trump administration official who adds that Musk is not much of a team player either [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=400.78s)]
*  He's just the most irritating person I've ever had to deal with and that is saying something especially someone who works for [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=406.29999999999995s)]
*  Donald Trump that is saying something want to show this as well [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=414.46s)]
*  Here's the audio of Elon Musk saying during his telephone town hall [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=418.14s)]
*  A while back that electing Trump would bring temporary hardship and pain [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=422.85999999999996s)]
*  Although I'm not sure Elon Musk expected to bring himself pain [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=428.21999999999997s)]
*  But as I said at the beginning karma comes for everyone and Elon Musk play this clip [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=432.21999999999997s)]
*  we have to reduce spending to look within our means and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=438.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that that necessarily involves some some temporary hardship [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7CTQGTyYJQ&t=445.29999999999995s)]
