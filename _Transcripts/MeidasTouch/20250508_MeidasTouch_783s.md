# Trump SPIRALS IN MORNING over TERRIBLE NEWS
**MeidasTouch:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU)
*  Just another total meltdown from Donald Trump this morning, blaming air traffic control problems and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=0.0s)]
*  massive delays at airports on former President Biden. Yep, we're well over 100 days now into [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=7.84s)]
*  this disastrous Trump regime, and here is what he's posting. Air traffic problems caused by the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=15.36s)]
*  incompetent Biden administration as headed by, in this case, a total novice and political hack, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=22.32s)]
*  Pete B. Then he puts in caps, I will fix it! Exclamation point. You know, Donald, under former [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=31.12s)]
*  President Biden and former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, you know what wasn't [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  happening? Planes weren't crashing frequently, there wasn't these massive, massive delays because [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=44.48s)]
*  air traffic controllers said that they're suffering from trauma as a result of radar shutting off [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=52.4s)]
*  because of the incompetence of your regime. So maybe just act like a leader. I know you can't. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=58.72s)]
*  I know you only know how to behave like a petulant little three-year-old bully, no offense to petulant [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=65.52s)]
*  three-year-old bullies, but just maybe try to act like an adult and take some level of accountability, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=71.28s)]
*  you idiot. Oh, and then Donald Trump posts the following. He attacks the chairman of the Federal [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=77.2s)]
*  Reserve, Jerome Powell, who Donald Trump appointed. Donald Trump goes, quote, too late, end quote. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=83.44s)]
*  Jerome Powell is a fool who doesn't have a clue. Other than that, I like him very much. Exclamation [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=91.92s)]
*  point. Oil and energy way down, almost all costs, groceries and eggs down, virtually no inflation, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=99.76s)]
*  tariff money pouring into the U.S., the exact opposite of, quote, too late, end quote. Enjoy, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  exclamation point. The golden age of America is coming. Now, I know a lot of his followers who [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=115.36s)]
*  still support him and they're getting less and less. Their magamush brain cult mindset goes [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=122.48s)]
*  oh, Donald tells me prices are lower. We all know that inflation is rising. Why? Because if we go [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=129.68s)]
*  into the grocery store, if we're going to look for cars, if we're going out to buy whatever the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=137.36s)]
*  products are, we see the prices going up. We know that mortgage rates are going up. We know that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  housing is less affordable now, not more affordable right now. By the way, we even hear Donald Trump [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=149.36s)]
*  and his Treasury Secretary, Scott Besson, saying that little girls should only be buying one doll [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=154.72s)]
*  and five pencils versus multiple dolls and they should be paying more for their dolls and they [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=160.88s)]
*  should stop whining and complaining. That's what the regime is actually saying. We all know that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=166.72s)]
*  tariffs are bad. We all can, if we have pensions or 401ks or, we see that it's going down. We know [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=171.84s)]
*  that we're worse off right now under Donald Trump. So when he goes enjoy and then the juxtaposition [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=181.2s)]
*  of Donald Trump saying enjoy, let them eat cake, while he's out there doing deals with Qatar [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  in the Middle East to build new resorts and doing deals with Saudi Arabia to build resorts in Oman [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=196.64s)]
*  and he's out there doing deals with the Abu Dhabi fund to put money into his crypto. The Trump [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=203.44s)]
*  family's made 2.6 billion dollars in the past 100 days off of crypto schemes and market schemes [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=210.56s)]
*  while we the people are suffering. We know what's going on. That's why Donald Trump's approval is [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=219.76s)]
*  plummeting. Donald Trump is basically straight out of that movie I've been talking about. Don't look [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=225.84s)]
*  up. Don't look up as the asteroid is coming. Frankly, little pieces of that asteroid have [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=231.68s)]
*  of that comet have already hit the United States. He's saying don't look up. I'm telling you [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=238.32s)]
*  look up. Look around you. Let's just recognize what the hell is happening in our country and say [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=243.6s)]
*  this is not America, damn it. Oh, then Donald Trump posts this today. World War II victory day [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=249.2s)]
*  and he posts the statue of the courageous United States soldiers in Iwo Jima. Donald, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=257.44s)]
*  Iwo Jima is not in Europe. Do you know what victory day signifies? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=264.64s)]
*  Do you know victory day? It's victory day in Europe. You're posting Iwo Jima. Trump does not even [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=270.24s)]
*  have the most basic understanding of anything. Geopolitics, American history, tariffs, economics, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  you name it. Spencer Akimeon says the bottom half of the country and I would say the bottom half of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=286.64s)]
*  the country is anyone who's in the 99% not the 1% or 1.1.1% of Trump. The bottom half of the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=292.64s)]
*  country is already in a recession and all Donald Trump is now doing is announcing gimmicky trade [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=301.44s)]
*  deals. What Trump said today, he's going to do a trade deal with the UK which will lower tariffs [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=308.64s)]
*  on Range Rovers from 25% to 10% even though it was 0% a month ago. So Donald Trump creates the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=315.2s)]
*  issue. He's the arsonist, creates a fire across the world, puts out a teeny tiny tiny one in the UK [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=323.84s)]
*  but doesn't really put it out. Deals with Range Rovers and Land Rovers and then acts like he's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=330.96s)]
*  done some massive deal that's not even a trade deal. Gimmicks after gimmicks after gimmicks. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=336.96s)]
*  So I'm reminded of the Trump propaganda during the campaign where the MAGA cult members and the MAGA [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=345.44s)]
*  supporters and MAGA people in general would have their kids go out and they would say how much [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=352.4s)]
*  they wanted Barbies to be cheaper and how Trump was going to make things cheaper. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=359.76s)]
*  Do you all remember this? Here play this clip. What do you want him to do? What do you want him to say today? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  Uh I want him I want him to lower prices and lower the taxes and make Barbies cheaper. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  Make Barbies cheaper? Yeah. Tell me more about that. Have they gotten expensive? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=384.32s)]
*  Yeah and Polly Pockets. All my favorite toys are so expensive. You're smart enough to know when [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=388.48s)]
*  something's not working. Like when you can't focus at work or when you're dragging by 2 p.m. or when [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=394.32s)]
*  your stomach feels like it's fighting you after every meal. Well here's the thing these aren't [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=399.52s)]
*  random symptoms. Your gut impacts everything from your digestion to your brain function to your [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=404.24s)]
*  energy levels. That's why we love Just Thrive probiotic. Unlike other brands that make big [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=410.0s)]
*  promises but fall apart in your stomach, Just Thrive is the only probiotic clinically proven [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=416.24s)]

*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besant wants to clarify what Donald Trump said about the little girls. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=465.52s)]
*  He wants you to know though this is a wrinkle that Treasury Secretary Scott Besant he goes [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=472.64s)]
*  even though your little girl is only going to have one dollar and five pencils she's going to [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  be happy in the future because we're going to bring low-paying factory jobs like screwing [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=482.16s)]
*  the iPhones together from China. We're going to bring those jobs to America and your little girls [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  can work in those factories for the rest of her life. Don't you like that? Play this clip. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=493.92s)]
*  The other thing too is this reporter behind me was quite snarky the other day when President Trump [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=498.32000000000005s)]
*  talked about the girl having two dolls and he said well what president didn't take the question [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=504.24s)]
*  but he said what would you tell that girl? I said I would tell that young girl that you will have a [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=511.52s)]
*  better life than your parents that you and your family thanks to President Trump can now be [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=516.8s)]
*  confident again that you will have a better life than your parents which working-class Americans [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=522.32s)]
*  had abandoned that idea. Your family will own a home. You will be able to advance. You will have [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=526.88s)]
*  a good education. You will have economic freedom. That's what we are advancing. Now even former [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=533.76s)]
*  vice president Mike Pence has been out there saying what in the world are these Trump people [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  doing? Y'all are killing the economy right now and what are you talking about with little girls? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=546.4s)]
*  Here play this clip. What we've been making lately is that maybe children will have to make do with [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=552.24s)]
*  fewer toys fewer dolls. The quote that he had yesterday was I'm just saying that they don't [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=556.72s)]
*  need to have 30 dolls. They can have three. They don't need to have 250 pencils. They can have five. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=562.0s)]
*  Do you think the American people buy that argument? I have two grown daughters. I have three small [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=568.72s)]
*  granddaughters and look keeping dolls affordable, keeping our kids toys affordable. That really is [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=574.72s)]
*  part of the American dream. I remember recently the secretary of the treasury said that cheap [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=583.52s)]
*  goods was not a part of the American dream. Well I'm somebody who spent almost my entire life in [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=589.2s)]
*  public service. We lived in our paycheck while we raised three kids and put three kids through [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=593.84s)]
*  college. Cheap goods are a big part of it. I think we ought to be candid about that. So with all of [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=599.2s)]
*  this going on with Trump harming our economy with our GDP shrinking you know the MAGA Republicans in [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=604.08s)]
*  the house were focused on all the important things today. I'm being sarcastic. Of course [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=611.0400000000001s)]
*  the U.S. House voted 211 to 206 to approve legislation to rename the Gulf of Mexico to [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=615.12s)]
*  the Gulf of America. Now MAGA Republicans refuse to do anything to assert their authority when it [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=621.92s)]
*  comes to things like trade deals and tariffs which they're constitutionally obligated to do. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=629.28s)]
*  Their budget which they call a big beautiful deal is a big beautiful disaster with MAGA Republicans [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=634.8s)]
*  in the Senate like MAGA Mike Johnson from Wisconsin saying that there's no chance he's [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=640.32s)]
*  going to support what they're doing in the house and it's dead on arrival and reconciliation. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=645.5200000000001s)]
*  It's good to know that the MAGA Republicans are focused on the renaming of things. I think there's [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=650.72s)]
*  12 separate bills as well circulating in the house to rename things after Donald Trump because these [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=655.44s)]
*  MAGA Republican sycophants are MAGA Republican sycophants. So Donald Trump goes and he talks [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  about this agreement with the United Kingdom. We've reached a comprehensive deal. Look Spencer [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=668.64s)]
*  Akimian says it right. After four weeks of negotiating with our closest ally the UK whom [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=674.48s)]
*  we run a trade surplus with all we were able to accomplish was a continuation of the 10 percent [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=680.16s)]
*  tariff rate with them. How are we going to possibly negotiate anything substantive with China, Europe, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=686.8s)]
*  Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan, etc. The gimmick president is doing gimmicky things and meanwhile our economy [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=691.68s)]
*  will pay the price for his desire to see himself on TV. Max Kennerly explains, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=697.76s)]
*  Rufal chuckle over how this trade deal will cement the relationship with the United States and the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=703.4399999999999s)]
*  UK for many years to come. We already had a trade deal with the United Kingdom and the other [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNDx0qZHBU&t=708.48s)]
