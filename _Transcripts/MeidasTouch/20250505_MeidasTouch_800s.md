# PISSED OFF Lawyers Launch MASSIVE PROTESTS against Trump
**MeidasTouch:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0)
*  United States and the Constitution of the State of New York and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the Office of Attorney and Counselor-in-Law according to the best of my abilities. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=29.0s)]
*  So May 1st from this past week was Law Day in addition to being May Day where we saw protests across the country and it was good to see lawyers out there protesting on Law Day, also May Day, but reaffirming their oaths to protect and defend the Constitution as a lawyer, the oath that I took. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=31.0s)]
*  And unfortunately we had seen a lot of big law firms capitulating to Donald Trump, but we also saw a lot of law firms, big, small and medium-sized, also standing up against Donald Trump and visually to see lawyers out there protesting to talk about what our solemn oath is as lawyers, why we went into this profession as a lawyer. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=54.0s)]
*  It was so great to see there were protests. That one was in New York in Manhattan's Foley Square, but they were across the country. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=78.0s)]
*  Here's a photo in Washington, D.C. as well of protests out there and then Democratic Congress member Jamie Raskin gave a speech in the Washington, D.C. protests with the group of lawyers before the Supreme Court. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=86.0s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=102.0s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=103.0s)]
*  The framers understood the dangers of a king, one person who thought that they had mad power over everybody else. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=104.0s)]
*  Our Constitution was designed against kings and queens and monarchs and nobles. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=113.0s)]
*  It's unconstitutional to create titles of nobility in the United States of America. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=119.0s)]
*  You may know this about me. I'm a law professor over in a law school in Southern California. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=127.0s)]
*  Congress member Raskin, a very well-known constitutional law professor before becoming a member of Congress. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=132.0s)]
*  Here's what he said at the 100-day mark as well right around the time of that protest. Let's play. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=139.0s)]
*  We're 100 days in now to this nightmare of a full-blown authoritarian assault on American institutions and all of the achievements of American democracy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=145.0s)]
*  They're attacking Medicaid. They want to cut $880 billion out of Medicaid. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=155.0s)]
*  We're involved in that fight this week. They're attacking Social Security. They're attacking Medicare. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=160.0s)]
*  They're attacking Head Start. They're attacking Meals on Wheels. You name it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=164.0s)]
*  There's a program that serves the people. They're going to try to dismantle it. They're going to try to crush it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=169.0s)]
*  Our federal agencies and our federal workers are under attack. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=174.0s)]
*  Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is under attack. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=177.0s)]
*  NIH is under attack. Measles are now resurgent in Texas and are threatening the spread around the country as Robert F. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=182.0s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. dismantles the public health infrastructure. They're attacking the freedom of speech. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=191.0s)]
*  They're attacking the freedom of press. They are flying people out of the country without a semblance of those two most beautiful words in the English language, due process, due process, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=196.0s)]
*  which protects our rights and freedoms against arbitrary government power and dictatorship. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=207.0s)]
*  So look, the good news is that people are fighting back. The courts are fighting back. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=213.0s)]
*  Nearly 200 cases have been brought. We've got 93 preliminary injunctions and temporary restraining orders against all of the lawlessness and all of the chaos that have been unleashed against us. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=218.0s)]
*  Millions of people are on the march across the country standing up for the Constitution and standing up for the Bill of Rights. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=231.0s)]
*  So we are undoubtedly in the fight of our lives, but Donald Trump's poll numbers are sinking. His administration is in chaos. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=239.0s)]
*  In the meantime, the forces of democracy and freedom are resurgent in the country. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=247.0s)]
*  So I want to encourage everybody to hang tough and stay strong in the fight for democracy and constitutional freedom in America. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=252.0s)]
*  Thank you, Congressmember Raskin and one of the groups that are on the front lines of fighting for our freedoms, fighting for due processes, democracy forward, led by its CEO, Sky Perryman. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=261.0s)]
*  Let's bring in the CEO of democracy forward, Sky Perryman. 200 lawsuits have been filed, 93 injunctions. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=275.0s)]
*  Your organization, Democracy Forward, is involved in basically all of them. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=281.0s)]
*  60 cases, Democracy Forward itself is directly filed, but you've been supporting all of these cases, hundreds of investigations as well. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=286.0s)]
*  Big wins. You're a litigator from Texas. So you know how to fight and you've seen what's going on there. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=296.0s)]
*  Talk to us about what your organization's been doing, some of the big ones lately. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=303.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, we, the people are fighting back and the number one, one of the major powers that people have in this time is their ability to initiate litigation against their government, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=307.0s)]
*  including their president when he or the government tramples on their rights. And so there's been a lot of trampling on people's rights. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=318.0s)]
*  And so we're filing a lot of cases, but we've really been able to make a difference, I think, with our brave clients across the board. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=325.0s)]
*  You've talked about this before. We stopped the federal funding freeze. We've stopped the freeze on infrastructure funds. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=332.0s)]
*  We have blocked ICE from entering houses of worship. We are involved in the Alien Enemies Act case where we've gotten nine members of the Supreme Court who don't agree on much to say people can't be removed from this country without process. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=338.0s)]
*  And so, you know, we're fighting on all fronts. Last night we won a great temporary restraining order blocking the decimation of an agency that funds libraries across the country. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=354.0s)]
*  And even something like that doesn't get enough attention that they're going into libraries. They're going into the African American Museum and taking out artifacts. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=363.0s)]
*  And in order to stop all of this, you know, you're involved in all of these lawsuits. And by the way, y'all were ready right away. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=376.0s)]
*  I mean, I remember like one of the first lawsuits that was filed right away that I think woke people up was the democracy forward lawsuits and your lawsuits against Doge and others about them stealing people's data. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=386.0s)]
*  How are you coordinating? I mean, I understand the organization's, you know, big. It's also lean and meat. Are you arranging all this stuff? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=398.0s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, part of it is we believed we believe the extremists when they said what they were going to do. So we read Project 2025 front to back. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=407.0s)]
*  We looked at what Stephen Miller and other right wing actors organizations had been doing and planning and we got to work. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=416.0s)]
*  And over the past year, we planned litigation that we would need to initiate to protect people if these things would come true. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=423.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, that's what's needed in this time. So we've been able to really move fast. We try to move fast and fix things that democracy forward. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=430.0s)]
*  We don't move fast and break things. And, you know, but I'll also say just a testament to our team here and to the lawyers at so many other organizations. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=438.0s)]
*  But this is not, you know, this is not fast food where you walk, you know, you go through some window and someone hands you the soda or a hamburger or something automatically. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=447.0s)]
*  Right. This is this is individual people that are staying up overnight, almost every night in order to get into court to protect the American people and to win these court orders. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=457.0s)]
*  And it's energizing because we see the good it's doing. We know it's not enough. We know fundamentally the courts are not a silver bullet. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=468.0s)]
*  It's going to take people power. But this is a real big, powerful tool that the people have. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=475.0s)]
*  You know, it's odd that we have to talk about things in terms of Trump appointed judges did this and George W. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=480.0s)]
*  But here we are because Donald Trump's out there saying liberal leftist activist judges. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=488.0s)]
*  But I mean, in terms of the cases that you're involved in, it's Trump appointed judges, it's Bush appointed judges, it's Reagan appointed judges. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=495.0s)]
*  And yes, Obama and Biden and Clinton. But the orders that you are seeing are not, you know, I think it's a good message that our viewers know this. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=504.0s)]
*  The federal courts are not in all cases, but they are holding strong on a lot of these cases that are filing. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=513.0s)]
*  Not all. What do you see in there? Yeah, I mean, they're holding strong. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=521.0s)]
*  And this is really important. And last night is a good day to talk to you because last night in an Alien Enemies Act case in Texas, you have a Trump appointed judge saying, you know, what are we doing with these wartime powers? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=525.0s)]
*  This is not lawful. We won an order last night from a judge that was appointed by a conservative president. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=535.0s)]
*  And that is something that we see all the time. So this is something that's really transcending politics. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=541.0s)]
*  We want to make sure the American people know that in the Biden administration, a lot of these legal groups, Stephen Miller's group and Jonathan Mitchell's groups and all the far right legal groups, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=547.0s)]
*  they would go sue in a few courts in my home state of Texas. They go to Amarillo. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=555.0s)]
*  They go to a few of these courts. The cases that you're seeing against this administration, which are being filed by necessity because of what this administration is doing to people's rights. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=560.0s)]
*  These are cases that are being filed all across the country. Right. Nobody's doing judge shopping. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=569.0s)]
*  Nobody's picking certain judges. And before all of these judges, including ones appointed by President Trump, we've been winning orders and our colleagues at other organizations have been winning orders. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=575.0s)]
*  That's a really powerful message, I think, for the American people to understand and to be confident that that the courts are going to do their thing. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=585.0s)]
*  The president wants to try to say he wants to evade court orders. He wants to say that because he doesn't want people going to court. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=594.0s)]
*  And you're seeing judges also across the courts really take steps to enforce their orders, which I think you're going to see in this next 100 days. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=601.0s)]
*  I want you to direct a message to all of the big law firms that have betrayed that oath that I talked about at the beginning or that I shared with at the beginning. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=610.0s)]
*  You know, these are firms that I knew probably once respected these big firms, these institutions that would do pro bono work. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=622.0s)]
*  I remember when I would do civil rights work and I guess when they viewed that as like a fashionable thing to support, they would provide some contributions to your organization, not yours, but the ones that I worked with. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=631.0s)]
*  I maybe, you know, you know, they provide good things to my organizations and, you know, they would kind of pretend to be allies and they would talk about pro bono stuff and then to see some of them. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=643.0s)]
*  Look, there's a lot more that I think are fighting back. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=655.0s)]
*  But some of these big top amla 100 firms that are making these deals with Trump, what's your message to them right now? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=657.0s)]
*  You know, I think we all as lawyers have a responsibility and you have to get in there and be a lawyer. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=665.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, we're not seeing that all the firms are doing that when the federal government does something and the president does something that is blatantly unconstitutional. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=671.0s)]
*  And let's be clear, the attacks on lawyers are blatantly unconstitutional and every single federal court that has considered the executive orders naming law firms has issued orders to block them because they are patently unlawful. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=679.0s)]
*  What does it say about lawyers that won't challenge that? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=693.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=697.0s)]
*  You know, we're supposed to be advocates. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=698.0s)]
*  And so we really at Democracy Forward, we take very seriously what the American Bar Association has come out and encouraged all lawyers to do, which you saw on Law Day, which is to defend the Constitution, to remember our oath and our professional ethics. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=700.0s)]
*  We're very proud of the firms and the organizations that are that are standing up in this time. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=714.0s)]
*  And our message in general to the American people is that there are a number of lawyers across this country that are going to work every single day to make sure that your rights are protected. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=719.0s)]
*  And we invite firms to join us in that, but we don't need them. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=729.0s)]
*  If they won't do this work, there are so many lawyers across the country that are really stepping in and stepping up. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=733.0s)]
*  Skye, if people want to learn more about the work of Democracy Forward, where can they go? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuzrbjt_op0&t=740.0s)]
