# MAGA Mike IN PANIC MODE as Bill Starts BLOWING UP
**MeidasTouch:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw)
*  The cracks are showing, Maga Mike, can you handle the pressure? It looks like Donald Trump's big, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=0.0s)]
*  beautiful bill is turning into a big, awful disaster, and you're the one holding the bag [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=6.8s)]
*  as this is all blowing up. And some of the Maga Republican senators are saying under no circumstance [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=13.6s)]
*  are they going to agree to this awful, awful bill that increases the deficit by trillions of dollars [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=19.84s)]
*  and guts Medicaid. So here Maga Mike Johnson held a press conference earlier in the day, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=27.6s)]
*  and he was asked a lot of questions, by the way, including Donald Trump accepting bribes from Cutter. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=33.6s)]
*  You can see Maga Mike's stress as he goes, I've been a little busy dealing with reconciliation, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=39.2s)]
*  so I don't know what are we talking about here with this with this Cutter jet? What are we talking [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=45.84s)]
*  about here? Play this clip. Look, I've been a little busy on reconciliation, so I'm not [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=50.56s)]
*  following all the twists and turns of the guitar jet. I've certainly heard about it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=64.48s)]
*  My understanding is it's not a personal gift to the president's gift to the United States and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=70.0s)]
*  other nations give us gifts all the time, but I'm going to leave to the administration. They [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=74.56s)]
*  know much more about the details of that. OK, I'm just it's not my lane. Yes, sir. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=78.88s)]
*  Although Maga Mike did seem to express some sympathy for members of Congress who engage in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=82.56s)]
*  insider stock trading. Let's play this clip. Well, look, you know, the salary of Congress has been [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=90.0s)]
*  frozen since 2009. You know, when you adjust for inflation, a member of Congress today is making [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  31 percent less than they made in that year. It goes down every year. And over time, if you stay [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  on this trajectory, you're going to have less qualified people who are willing to make the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=106.56s)]
*  extreme sacrifice to run for Congress. And it's just people just make a reasonable decision as a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=112.0s)]
*  family on whether or not they can come and move to Washington, have a residence here, residence at [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=115.76s)]
*  home and do all the things that are required. So the counter argument is and I have some sympathy, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  look, at least let them like engage in some stock trading so that they can continue to, you know, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  take care of their family. Mike Johnson is then asked if he has concerns about Donald Trump's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=132.32000000000002s)]
*  business dealings. Here's what Maga Mike says. Speaker, you are very critical of President Biden [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=138.88s)]
*  and his family's foreign business dealings and supported an impeachment inquiry as a result of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  it. Are you equally concerned about President Trump's family's business dealings, especially [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=149.52s)]
*  given the fact that he is in a region now where his family has billions of dollars in investments [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=154.0s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia and the fact that he has a crypto business now where he's auctioned off access to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=158.72s)]
*  the White House for the highest bidder in his meetings? Look, there are authorities that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=164.48s)]
*  police executive branch ethics rules. I'm not an expert in that. My expertise is here in the house. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=170.72s)]
*  OK, I'll say that the reason that many people refer to the Bidens as the Biden crime family is [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=175.12s)]
*  because they were doing all this stuff behind curtains, but in the back rooms, they were trying [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=180.64s)]
*  to conceal it and they repeatedly lied about it and they set up shell companies and the family [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=184.48s)]
*  was all engaged and getting all on the dole. Whatever that President Trump is doing is out [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=188.88s)]
*  in the open. They're not trying to conceal anything. The investment in the meme coin, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=194.64s)]
*  those folks are not transparent. We do not know who those people are. I don't know anything about [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  the meme coin thing. I don't know. I can just tell you that. I mean, President Trump has had [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=204.32s)]
*  nothing to hide. He's very upfront about it. And there are people who watch all the ethics of that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  But I mean, I've got to be concerned with running the House of Representatives, and that's what I do. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=213.84s)]
*  Congress has oversight responsibility, but I think so far as I know, the ethics are all being followed. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  So yes, sir. It's always projection and confession with these people. It is the Trump crime family [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=225.84s)]
*  and the fact that they are doing it in plain sight doesn't make it any better. And it also [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=233.28s)]
*  doesn't mean that there's a lot going on behind the scenes as well. These meme coins are basically [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  untraceable. So which foreign governments are they're hard to trace. So which foreign governments [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=245.6s)]
*  are using their meme coin wallets and hiding it to buy off Donald Trump? What else is going on [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=251.68s)]
*  behind the scenes that we don't know about? Because actually the way the cutter jet was [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  exposed was through confidential sources who Donald Trump's DOJ wants to go after. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=264.08s)]
*  So then what does Maga Mike have to do? Just think about this threatening his colleagues, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=270.56s)]
*  the Democratic Congress members with arrest. That's where we are right now where this despicable, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=276.4s)]
*  vile piece of trash speaker of the House, Coward, who has some weird app where he monitors his son's [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=281.92s)]
*  website of going to port and his son monitors their mutual porn. So weird stuff going on. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=289.2s)]
*  Here's Maga Mike threatening to arrest Democrats and saying the DOJ is looking into it. What he's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=295.84s)]
*  talking about is how Democratic Congress members were at Delaney Hall, a migrant detention center, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=302.32s)]
*  which was reopened in Newark, where the private prison guards assaulted the mayor and assaulted [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=308.8s)]
*  Democratic Congress members. But now the Maga playbook is saying we're going to prosecute [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=315.6s)]
*  Democratic Congress members because that's what the Trump regime wants us to do. Here play this [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=320.48s)]
*  clip. Mr. Speaker, can you flesh out the possible discipline that these members, the Democrats could [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=325.36s)]
*  face for what happened in New Jersey? Well, look, there's three possible disciplinary actions that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=331.36s)]
*  Congress, the House can take. OK, you can, since you're a member and that probably does seem [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  appropriate here, you can kick them off committees. That's a new tradition begun by the Democrats [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=342.4s)]
*  in recent years. And you can expel someone from Congress. Now, expulsion requires a two-thirds [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=347.92s)]
*  vote. That's not likely because the margins are small on both sides. But, you know, we're looking [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=352.8s)]
*  at what is appropriate. Look, I think I think it's pretty clear that the law was violated. You might [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=358.96s)]
*  have noticed the Wisconsin judge that was trying to conceal the illegal alien that was going to be [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=363.28s)]
*  apprehended by ICE. A federal grand jury indicted the judge. I think that was late yesterday. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=368.64s)]
*  And I'm told that she'll be brought up on charges, maybe facing potentially six years in jail and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=374.88s)]
*  three hundred fifty thousand dollars in fines because she obstructed the proceedings, obstructed [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=379.76s)]
*  justice and and was engaged in other activities. So look, this what what these House Democrats did [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=384.96s)]
*  is in that same lane, the same vein of what the judge is being indicted for. So I think there's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  some I think there's some legal ramifications to play out here and we'll see how it works. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=396.64s)]
*  Expulsion on the table. We're we're talking through all the possibilities. Yes, ma'am. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=400.24s)]
*  What if I told you the most luxurious place to listen to this podcast could be on your toilet? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  Cloud Plus by Tushy Bade turns your toilet into a biohacking throne that automatically deodorizes [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=410.88s)]
*  the air the moment you sit down. I'm going to keep it real. The Tushy Bade has become my absolute [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  favorite part of my day. The installation was incredibly easy and the cleaning experience is [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=421.84s)]
*  perfect. Traditional toilet paper absolutely does not stand a chance. The Tushy Bade leaves me [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  feeling cleaner and more fresh after I do my business than anything else. Tushy is the everyday [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=432.56s)]
*  luxury bidet that instantly transforms your bathroom habits and bottom health for life. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=438.23999999999995s)]
*  Tushy's elevated bidet collection nurtures your bottom with instant warm water that never runs [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=443.52s)]
*  cold, a soothing heated seat, and UV sterilization for next level hygiene. All Tushy Bade's easily [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=448.8s)]
*  attached to your existing toilet without the need for additional plumbing. Instead of wiping [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  endlessly with toilet paper, Tushy pristinely removes 99% of bacteria while protecting your [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=460.48s)]
*  natural skin barrier thanks to one natural ingredient, fresh water. Reclaim your comfort [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=466.48s)]
*  zone in the bathroom. For a limited time, our listeners get 10% off their first bidet odor [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=472.48s)]
*  when you use code MIDAS at checkout. That's 10% off your first bidet odor at hellotushy.com [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=477.84s)]
*  with promo code MIDAS. Let's take a look at what some of these MAGA Republican Congress members [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=485.91999999999996s)]
*  are saying. Like here, Josh Hawley from Missouri saying that he's not going to support the bill [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=491.35999999999996s)]
*  that's in the current form in the House of Representatives. Play this clip. We do that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=499.76s)]
*  by giving them tax relief. We do that by bringing down their health care bills. We don't do it by [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=503.76s)]
*  cutting Medicaid. If this bill becomes law, are you concerned that Republicans could face a severe [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=508.08s)]
*  blowback in the elections next year? This bill is not going to become law in its current form, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=513.76s)]
*  not least because President Trump won't sign it. Manu, I've talked to him about this personally [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  multiple times. He has been crystal clear in public too, no Medicaid benefit cuts. We need [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  to give a tax cut to working people, not raise their taxes when it comes to health care, not [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  take away their health care benefits. I hope this bill will get refocused on delivering relief for [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=532.4s)]
*  working families. That's what we ought to be doing. Do you think some of the wealthier taxpayers [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=537.6s)]
*  should pay higher taxes? I'm fine with that. You know, the president has floated that. He said, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=541.1999999999999s)]
*  maybe we ought to allow the top rate, the very top rate for people making over a million or over [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=545.84s)]
*  $5 million a year to go back to where it was before. It's like a one point increase, Manu. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=550.9599999999999s)]
*  I would be fine with that if that's what the president wants to do. Bottom line. Here's [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=555.6s)]
*  MAGA Republican Congress member Lawler who says that he's a no on the reconciliation bill. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=558.64s)]
*  Three of the four counties that I represent are in the top 16 highest property tax counties in [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=588.64s)]
*  America. And so having an income cap of 400,000 would devastate so many families across my [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=595.68s)]
*  district. And I'm just not going to accept it. And so, you know, we will negotiate and hopefully [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=603.52s)]
*  come to an agreement. But the fact is that as this stands as currently written, I'm a no. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=609.12s)]
*  You're a no. Here's some additional opposition from MAGA Republican senators. Manu Raju was [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=616.72s)]
*  able to interview MAGA Republican Ron Johnson from Wisconsin and others. Here's what he had to say. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=623.76s)]
*  Play this clip. I don't think people who voted for President Trump thought that we would continue [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=631.2s)]
*  spending at President Biden's levels. I don't see any way I could support more tax cuts and [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=636.64s)]
*  more deficit spending. We should not be increasing deficit. I do fear that all the really large [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=643.76s)]
*  ticket items for reducing spending have sort of been excluded. So I have a feeling it's going to [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=649.6s)]
*  be wimpy on the spending cuts and it's going to be maybe a little wimpy on the taxes too. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=653.84s)]
*  Should also be noted that I think Democrats have been doing some great cross exams during [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=660.8s)]
*  these congressional hearings. For example, you had Democratic Congress member Tom Swasey expose [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=665.28s)]
*  that in cross exam of one of the individuals who has to rate this tax bill that actually all of [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=672.08s)]
*  Donald Trump's promises on the campaign trail about no tax on this and no tax was false. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=680.08s)]
*  Play this clip. Okay. On tips, the president said your tips will be 100% yours. Does this [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=685.6s)]
*  tax bill continue the payroll tax on people's tips? Yes, it does. Over time, the president said your [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=693.0400000000001s)]
*  overtime will be tax free. Does this bill continue the payroll tax on overtime? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=699.52s)]
*  It does not exempt over time from the payroll tax. The president said he's going to remove taxes on [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=704.64s)]
*  social security. Does this bill remove taxes on social security benefits? The legislation provides [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=710.0s)]
*  an increased exemption amount. But does it remove taxes on social security benefits as promised by [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=716.0799999999999s)]
*  the president? Does not change social. The president and the Republicans. And we also know [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=722.0s)]
*  that from additional cross exam that tens of millions of people will lose their health [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=727.44s)]
*  insurance. Play this clip of Democratic Congress member Doggett and his questions. Play this clip. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=732.48s)]
*  Mr. Barthold, that this legislation fails to extend the enhanced tax credits that lower the cost of [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=737.84s)]
*  insurance for millions of Americans who purchase their own coverage through the marketplace. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=744.08s)]
*  That's correct. And when the Republicans permit these credits to expire in a mere seven months, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=749.6s)]
*  what is the effect on health insurance premiums for those individuals that rely on the marketplace [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=755.2800000000001s)]
*  today? Work that our staff has done in conjunction with the Congressional Budget Office [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=760.96s)]
*  suggested that premiums will increase for individuals. Yes, sir. They go up about almost [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=770.32s)]
*  8 percent. I believe it's a specific calculation that you did. And is it true that this failure on [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=775.36s)]
*  the part of Republicans will raise premiums not just for those not that they'll raise them really [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=780.72s)]
*  for nearly everyone in the marketplace, not just for those who receive the subsidies? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=787.12s)]
*  That's that's correct. That's part of the analysis. If my understanding is correct, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=793.36s)]
*  failure to extend this policy will result in an increase in the number of uninsured Americans. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=798.48s)]
*  Is that right? That's correct, sir. That's and I've received that you see the cracks beginning [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=804.32s)]
*  to form as well right here. Here's Maga Republican Congress member Jeff Herd, who talks about his [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=811.2s)]
*  concerns of Donald Trump getting bribed by. Can I play this clip backlash even from some Republicans [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=817.6800000000001s)]
*  and Naga allies like Laura Loomer and Ben Shapiro? Where do you stand on that decision? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=823.84s)]
*  I have serious concerns with this so-called gift from the government of Qatar, security concerns, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=830.0s)]
*  ethical concerns using this used airplane. But it's also a gift from a government that supports [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=836.7199999999999s)]
*  terrorist organizations like Hamas. So if there were a Democratic president that was accepting [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=842.9599999999999s)]
*  a gift like this, we'd be outraged. I think it's something that we should look at carefully. And [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=846.9599999999999s)]
*  I have definitely serious concerns with this this gift. And what do you make of the fact that now [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=850.7199999999999s)]
*  the Trump administration is saying, well, actually, it's going to go to a department, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=856.32s)]
*  DOD, State Department. It's really going to get a gift to the department. Does that [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=860.08s)]
*  assuage your concerns at all? Not six and one half a dozen of the other. I'm still concerned with [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=864.32s)]
*  this gift. Again, there's ethical concerns that I think still remain, but there's also security [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=869.2800000000001s)]
*  concerns. Why are we accepting a gift from this used airplane that's 13 years old from a government [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=873.9200000000001s)]
*  that is aligned with individuals and organizations that are hostile to our interests and abilities? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=879.36s)]
*  It just makes me concerned fundamentally. It's a bad issue. And I again, regardless of who the [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=883.84s)]
*  president is, I think we would be cautious. And I certainly something that I cannot support. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=889.76s)]
*  And here's a MAGA Republican Senator Kennedy talking about Qatar. Play this clip. Reflections [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=894.24s)]
*  on what we're watching now, Senator. Well, first quickly, Qatar. I trust Qatar like I like I trust [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=899.76s)]
*  a rest stop bathroom. If they want to be friendly, I want to be friendly back. But [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=911.1999999999999s)]
*  with those guys, you know, trust in God, but tie up your camel. Now, in terms of Iran, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=916.9599999999999s)]
*  what you do is what you believe. And everything else is just cottage cheese. That's true in life [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=923.76s)]
*  and in foreign policy. You can't just talk tough. You got to be tough. And finally, Democratic [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=930.3199999999999s)]
*  Congress member Jared Moskowitz. Let's show you what he had to say. Let's play it. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=936.48s)]
*  Donald Trump said he's not cutting Medicaid. OK. And so, you know, that's what he's been saying. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=940.0s)]
*  OK. And yet Republicans come with almost 800 billion dollars of Medicaid cuts, which is what [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=945.9200000000001s)]
*  the Democrats have been talking about for the last five months. You know, there are members here in [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=951.28s)]
*  the House and the Senate said they're not going to cut Medicaid. And it looks like, John, we're [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=956.88s)]
*  literally on our way to capitulation. And so, you know, this is taking health care away from our [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=960.8s)]
*  most vulnerable to try to offset some of these tax cuts. They're still going to add trillions of [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=968.0799999999999s)]
*  dollars to debt. Don't listen to me. Just listen to Chip Roy or Thomas Massey who are saying that. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tj0rSX0ouw&t=973.3599999999999s)]
