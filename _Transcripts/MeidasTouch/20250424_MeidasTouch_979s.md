# Trump UTTERLY SCREWS Red States by DENYING REQUESTS
**MeidasTouch:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0)
*  The states that voted for Donald Trump are getting the biggest middle finger in the world from Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=0.0s)]
*  When it even comes to things like disaster relief and FEMA aid, Donald Trump is looking at these red states that many of them overwhelmingly voted for him. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=6.88s)]
*  And Trump's saying, F you, I hate you. You are not getting aid. Go screw yourself. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=18.6s)]
*  He's not using those exact words, but he's sending the same kind of form letter saying, we are not giving you aid. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=24.92s)]
*  He did it recently in Arkansas. He did it recently in Kentucky. He did it recently in Georgia. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  He did it recently in North Carolina. Now, obviously, Arkansas and Kentucky voted like 63, 64 percent for Donald Trump. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  He's not even giving them emergency aid. I want you to think about that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=52.64s)]
*  And then in the past two weeks or so, we reported how he's not giving North Carolina aid to remove debris. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  He said, you ain't getting that. And then a few weeks before that, he told Governor Kemp of Georgia, I ain't giving you debris removal aid. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=65.2s)]
*  Go deal with the debris yourself. State federal government is not helping you out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=75.2s)]
*  And by the way, while Donald Trump is giving the middle finger to these states on emergency relief from freaking natural disasters, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=80.44s)]
*  what's Donald Trump spending his time doing? Well, he was pumping up his meme coin yesterday by inviting the 220 people who have the most Trump meme coins in their wallets, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=89.6s)]
*  get special access to Donald Trump and they can have a private dinner with him. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=104.16s)]
*  Black tie optional, of course, Donald Trump says. It pumped the value of his meme coin, but then it quickly went down. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=109.32s)]
*  It's like a pump and dump with this guy while he is OK dumping the debris and dumping all of the disastrous things that happen with natural disasters on even red states and blue states alike. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=116.84s)]
*  Donald Trump is saying my meme coin, what it went up 71 percent and then it went right back down. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=132.56s)]
*  And I want to tie this all together. So first, let's take a look at this from Arkansas. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  Tornado victims blocked from federal recovery aid after Trump denied request. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=144.88s)]
*  So Trump looks at victims of a tornado and Donald Trump says, screw you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=151.24s)]
*  The Trump administration denied Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders request for individual and public assistance following an outbreak of severe storms and tornadoes that also affected neighboring Mississippi and Missouri and left more than 40 people dead. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=157.0s)]
*  And by the way, you may be saying, Ben, I didn't even hear about this tragedy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=173.2s)]
*  Well, they did in Arkansas, they did in Missouri, and we did cover it here on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=178.2s)]
*  But you know who didn't talk about it? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  Not a peep. Donald Trump, the same way Donald Trump doesn't talk about the four soldiers who died in Lithuania, the two American soldiers who died in New Mexico and one critically injured. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=185.12s)]
*  The way Donald Trump doesn't address shootings that take place, the same way Donald Trump doesn't do any of that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  He doesn't address the fact that there have been these horrific storms that have left dozens and dozens of people dead. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  It goes on to say the denial by Trump follows executive order signed by Trump seeking to shift the burden of disaster response and recovery from the federal government onto states as extreme weather becomes increasingly destructive and costly in a warming world. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=208.6s)]
*  And by the way, it says it's unclear if Missouri got the same letter. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  Now, it should also be noted that this is this is what Trump and the mega Republicans plan is for Medicaid, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=229.2s)]
*  Whereas Medicaid right now has a cost sharing 90 percent federal government, 10 percent states with kind of a match 90 10. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=235.32s)]
*  What the MAGA plan is to get rid of Medicaid is push it all to the states which can't afford to provide Medicaid. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=243.16s)]
*  They rely on the federal government. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=251.16s)]
*  Most states or many states have trigger laws that the moment federal government stops its funding, Medicaid goes away. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  And this way, Trump and his despicable authoritarian regime can just put the blame on the states. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=261.56s)]
*  Let's let's dig a little bit deeper into this as well. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=268.8s)]
*  So that's what's happening in Arkansas. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=271.6s)]
*  Let's take a look at what Governor Beshear, a Democratic governor of Kentucky, who I had on the Midas Touch Network, here's what he posted yesterday. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=273.28s)]
*  Today, Governor Andy Beshear announced that FEMA has denied public assistance for two counties and individual assistance for six counties affected by flooding in February. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=280.8s)]
*  So Donald Trump said, screw you tornado victims, screw you flooding victims. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=291.6s)]
*  And as I'll show you in a little bit, Donald Trump said, screw you Hurricane Helene victims in Georgia and North Carolina. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=297.16s)]
*  Deal with your own debris yourself. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=304.8s)]
*  The federal government apparently just exists to garnish wages, destroy people's lives and steal your data and destroy your Social Security and your Medicaid. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=306.88s)]
*  And I mean it. Oh, and take the economy. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=317.28s)]
*  What a despicable, vile group of people. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=319.52s)]
*  I don't know how else to describe it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=323.28s)]
*  The weather is heating up and your nighttime bedroom temperature has a huge impact on your sleep quality. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=324.8s)]
*  If you wake up too hot or too cold, I highly recommend that you check out Miracle Maid's bedsheets. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=330.08s)]

*  Let's take a look right here at the letter from FEMA that they sent right here to Governor Beshear. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=443.36s)]
*  Let's just look. Let's look at source documents. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=449.48s)]
*  This is like the letter that Arkansas got, that Georgia got. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=451.64s)]
*  Just so you go. Just so you know, I'm not blowing smoke here, right? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=454.52000000000004s)]
*  This is what the letter that Kentucky got and North Carolina got when it comes to the hurricane. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=457.8s)]
*  Dear Governor Beshear, this is in response to your February 17, 2025 request for a major disaster declaration for the Commonwealth of Kentucky [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=461.96000000000004s)]
*  as a result of severe storms, straight line winds, flooding, landslides and mudslides during the period of February 14 to March 7, 2025. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=471.72s)]
*  You specifically requested individual assistance for 22 counties, public assistance for 69 counties and hazard mitigation for the entire Commonwealth. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=481.96000000000004s)]
*  Let's pause there for a second, too. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=491.6s)]
*  The letter was sent on February 17, 2025. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=493.40000000000003s)]
*  The Trump regime is first responding April 22, 2025. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=497.72s)]
*  That don't sound government efficiency to me. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=502.16s)]
*  It goes on to talk about how the February 24, 2025 major disaster declaration and subsequent amendments [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=505.64000000000004s)]
*  authorized individual assistance for 16 counties and then goes on to talk about what it's doing. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=513.84s)]
*  The impact to individual households and the infrastructure was significant. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=519.44s)]
*  However, based on the results of the joint preliminary damage assessment, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=523.44s)]
*  it has been determined that the impact to the individuals and households in Butler, Franklin, Knox, Laurel, Lawrence and Whitley counties [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=528.12s)]
*  is not of the severity and magnitude that warrant their designations under the individual assistance program. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=535.84s)]
*  And then it goes on to talk about how, therefore, your request is denied. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  These denials may be appealed, but you can see the source document yourself. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=548.36s)]
*  That's the letter that they received. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=553.04s)]
*  Now, you want to take a look at some of the other letters that were out there as well. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=554.8399999999999s)]
*  Here's the letter that they got in Georgia in response to Governor Kemp. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=558.56s)]
*  Here it is right here. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=563.3199999999999s)]
*  FEMA, February 12, 2025. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=564.64s)]
*  Dear Governor Kemp, this is in response to your January 24, 2025 request for an extension to the cost share waiver [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=567.3199999999999s)]
*  under the major disaster FEMA-4830-DR that was declared on September 30, 2024 due to Hurricane Helene. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=575.4s)]
*  You specifically requested an extension of the 100% federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=585.88s)]
*  including direct federal assistance to 100 days. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=593.68s)]
*  And you reiterated your request for an increase in the federal cost share for permanent work to 90%. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=596.88s)]
*  And it says, based on our review of all the information available, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=603.12s)]
*  it has been determined that the increased level of funding you have requested for the major disaster is not warranted. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=607.16s)]
*  Therefore, I must inform you that your request for more federal funding is denied. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=614.08s)]
*  OK, that was the letter that Georgia got. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=619.8s)]
*  And then in North Carolina, they got a similar letter right here. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=622.12s)]
*  Here was a letter that they got in North Carolina. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=627.36s)]
*  Dear Governor Stein, you can read it yourself. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=629.48s)]
*  It follows the same format. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=632.36s)]
*  Based on all of our review of all information available, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=634.04s)]
*  it has been determined that the increased level of funding you have requested for the major disaster is not warranted. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=636.92s)]
*  Therefore, I must inform you that the debris removal is hereby denied. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=643.0s)]
*  Denied, denied, denied, denied, denied. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=647.6s)]
*  Now, I think when I share that with you, it's also worth me just contrasting that to how former President Biden handled things here. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=650.08s)]
*  So let me just share with you how former President Biden handled things. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=659.04s)]
*  So here's former President Biden talking about how for him, he was honored to approve that FEMA gave, for example, Texas, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=662.24s)]
*  13 billion dollars in 13 billion dollars in three years in disaster relief. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=671.76s)]
*  As he said, when disasters strike, there's no red state or blue state where I come from. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=677.2s)]

*  Every governor said right away we got what we needed. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=745.8s)]

*  That corporate news media, by and large, I don't want to lump everyone together because there were people calling it out. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=750.8s)]
*  But by and large, what was corporate media doing? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=756.4799999999999s)]
*  They were said they were not talking about Donald Trump lying. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=759.4s)]

*  OK, which was a lie. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=783.64s)]
*  Biden gave an initial $750,000 to everyone right away and then additional relief. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=784.92s)]
*  Just $750,000 without even asking questions you got. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=788.9599999999999s)]

*  But Trump and this whole MAGA ecosystem here in the United States lied about it. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=799.24s)]

*  FEMA, we had such a good FEMA. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=836.12s)]
*  We had FEMA was great under Trump. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=838.2s)]
*  That I can tell you, we had tremendous success. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=840.44s)]
*  OK, folks, let me go back to what former President Biden said to conclude this video. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=843.28s)]
*  When it comes to disaster, it's not a red state thing or a blue state thing. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=847.6800000000001s)]
*  OK, you help Americans in need. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=852.0400000000001s)]
*  That's what the purpose of a government is for. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=855.12s)]
*  For Donald Trump, a government is by the bullies for the oligarchs. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=857.76s)]
*  For Trump, government is a tool to make rich people richer, not to actually do governing at all. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=862.4399999999999s)]
*  And that's what one of the things that piss me off the most about this is how corporate news tries to present the issues I just presented to you. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=870.88s)]
*  Well, the Democrats think this and Republicans think that. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=880.16s)]
*  And then we get a split screen and then you fight and then you fight and duke it out, everybody and everybody else. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=883.4s)]
*  Then we cut to a commercial break. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=888.8s)]
*  No, we are Americans, damn it. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=890.08s)]
*  And the federal government, when there's disasters, is supposed to step up and to help we the people. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=893.84s)]
*  The federal government's not supposed to inflict pain and suffering, disappear people, torture people, make people feel like crap. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=901.2800000000001s)]
*  They want us to believe that that's what the government is so that in our suffering, we avoid, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=910.24s)]
*  and we run away and we don't stop this fascist authoritarian regime. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=916.72s)]
*  Do not run away. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=921.6800000000001s)]
*  We need to be aware of what's going on. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=923.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's why we've created the Midas Touch Network, to share, to share this information, to make it accessible, to read for you the letters so you can see for yourself. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=926.1600000000001s)]
*  He screwed the people in Arkansas. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=935.84s)]
*  You go through some of these states, people in Kentucky voted for 64.5 percent of the vote. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZHL9Ws3Y0&t=937.52s)]
