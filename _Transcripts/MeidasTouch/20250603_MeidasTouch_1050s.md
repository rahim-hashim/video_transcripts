# TERRIFIED White House holds DISASTER PRESSER on LIVE TV
**MeidasTouch:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM)
*  The White House just held a disastrous press conference. Chief Propagandist or [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=0.0s)]
*  Press Secretary Caroline Levitt was asked about all of the fraudulent citations on a recent [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=6.08s)]
*  MAHA Make American Healthy Again report by R.F.K. Jr., which makes it appear that the report was [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=14.16s)]
*  pretty much created using AI with fake citations and fake articles and fake authors. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=21.6s)]
*  Here's what Caroline Levitt had to say. Play the clip. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=28.24s)]
*  Next, Caroline Levitt is asked about when are these deals happening? And now we hear [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=58.24s)]
*  that instead of doing deals, Donald Trump's just going to write a letter to countries saying, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Here's your tariff number. Play the clip. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=85.2s)]
*  Next up, Peter Ducey from Fox asks Caroline Levitt, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=115.28s)]
*  How mad do you think Trump's going to be when he finds out that Elon Musk has come out against the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=143.2s)]
*  budget bill? Play this clip. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=150.88s)]
*  Just for us, Caroline, how mad do you think President Trump is going to be when he finds [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=152.55999999999997s)]
*  out that Elon Musk said, I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=156.64s)]
*  port-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=161.2s)]
*  for it. You know you did wrong. You know it. Look, the president already knows where Elon Musk [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  stood on this bill. It doesn't change the president's opinion. This is one big, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=172.0s)]
*  beautiful bill and he's sticking to it. Thank you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=175.6s)]
*  And by the way, Elon Musk says, I'm sorry, I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=178.4s)]
*  outrageous, port-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. I'm going to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=184.08s)]
*  make a whole other video on just Elon Musk tanking the budget bill. Next up, a reporter asks Caroline [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=189.68s)]
*  Leavitt, so what are you going to do with the fact that 40% of crop farm workers are undocumented? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=198.16s)]
*  Are you going to deport them and just kill the entire agriculture industry? To which Caroline [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=204.56s)]
*  Leavitt says, yes. Play the clip. Thanks a lot, Caroline. I want to bring it back to the way you [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=210.48s)]
*  began your briefing talking about the president's mass deportation program and his priorities. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=216.0s)]
*  40% of crop farm workers in the U.S. are undocumented and that's according to the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=222.4s)]
*  Agriculture Department. Do they have a carve out in terms of the president's mass deportation [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=228.08s)]
*  program? The president and the Trump administration have been very clear. If you are in the country [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=233.2s)]
*  illegally, you are subject to deportation. Is there any concern that given that large number, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=238.8s)]
*  if that number is correct, 40% of crop farm workers being undocumented, that that could [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=245.44s)]
*  impact the food supply here in America if those individuals that obviously help pick [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=251.12s)]
*  crops all across the country are deported and mass? Again, this administration is focused on [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=256.56s)]
*  deporting individuals who are in our country illegally. It's something we have to do. We [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=263.92s)]
*  cannot allow the previous administration's invasion of our country of illegal immigrants to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=268.56s)]
*  continue. We just can't have it and this is a law and order president. As for our farmers [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=274.48s)]
*  and their concerns, they have a president who has their backs and listens to their concerns [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=278.72s)]
*  and hears them. But we also have a legal pathway to come to this country and work [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  specifically for agricultural work. So there's a legal way to do it and we encourage [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=288.56s)]
*  that legal pathway and we're currently working on strengthening our illegal immigration system [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  for that reason. Next up, you have a reporter asking Caroline Levitt that business leaders [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=298.8s)]
*  are begging for certainty in the markets to which Caroline Levitt responds, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=304.8s)]
*  actually business leaders are begging to meet Donald Trump. They're begging to meet him. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  Really weird. Play the clip. You've got US business leaders begging for certainty. So why did the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=317.76s)]
*  president suddenly decide to hike tariffs on steel and aluminum again? You also have US business [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=324.32s)]
*  leaders begging to meet with this president and begging to come to the White House to talk to him [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=331.44s)]
*  because they know that he is a negotiator in chief, that he's making good deals on behalf of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=337.52s)]
*  the American worker and the steel worker in particular when it comes to the steel and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=342.48s)]
*  aluminum tariffs, which he discussed in his speech at length at Pennsylvania and the need for them. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=347.12s)]
*  And I, this episode of the Midas Touch Podcast is brought to you by Grazza. It's that time of the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=352.4s)]
*  year, whether you're grilling on the deck or chilling at the beach, Grazza is your one and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=357.44s)]
*  only summertime never blended single origin olive oil. I love the trio. There's Frizzle with a 490 [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=361.2s)]
*  degree smoke point ideal for grilling, frying or crisping. Sizzle is your everyday go-to for [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=367.84s)]
*  roasting, marinating and sauteing and Drizzle, bold, punchy, grassy and bright. It elevates [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=373.28s)]
*  everything from potato salad to bread, even ice cream. I've made some of the best salad dressings [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=379.92s)]
*  with that Drizzle by the way. And here's what sets it apart. Grazza is extra virgin, super fresh, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=385.12s)]
*  single varietal and always clean and pure. No blends, just vibrant, aromatic traceable goodness [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=390.4s)]
*  from one olive varietal from one region. Personally, I love the no mess squeeze and spray bottles. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=396.56s)]
*  It makes cooking cleaner and quicker and with a zero mess. And I'll be honest, I was so psyched [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=402.8s)]
*  when Grazza came on board as a sponsor because as someone who loves to cook, I had already been the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=408.16s)]
*  biggest fan of their olive oils. Here's the best part. You get 10% off your first order on Grazza [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=412.96s)]
*  site, but I highly recommend grabbing the trio. Sizzle, Frizzle and Drizzle. So you're covered for [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=418.32s)]
*  every kind of cooking. So head to grazza.co and use Midas to get 10% off the trio, which includes [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=423.76s)]
*  sizzle, Frizzle and Drizzle and get to cook in your next chef quality meal. That's grazza.co [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  code Midas, M-E-I-D-A-S. Caroline Levitt is next asked about the South Korean election [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=438.08s)]
*  where the center left candidate Lee Jae Myung just won South Korea's presidential election. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=445.44s)]
*  Defeating the conservative candidate. She knows nothing about what even happened. She's like, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=452.32s)]
*  let me go and read it. Oops, I don't have my notes. Play this clip. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=458.0s)]
*  Does the White House have a reaction to the results of the election? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=461.84s)]
*  Yes, we do. In fact, let me find it here for you. Should be somewhere in here. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=466.08000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. We do not, but I will get you on Jeff. Go ahead. Thanks, guys. Two questions on trade. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=475.12s)]
*  So today, Laura Loomer, the right wing conspiracy theorist, like 9-11 conspiracy theorist, like total [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=482.88s)]
*  wacko. Laura Loomer was meeting with J.D. Vance today, the vice president, and Caroline Levitt [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=490.0s)]
*  was asked about that. Play this clip. On domestic, there is a report that Laura [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=496.56s)]
*  Loomer met with the vice president today. Can you speak to her relationship with the administration [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  and if she's informally advising in any way? She is not. I do know she met with the vice president. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=506.96000000000004s)]
*  As for what was discussed in that meeting, I would defer you to his team. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=514.0s)]
*  Next up, a reporter asked Caroline Levitt, when are we going to see the text to this supposed [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=517.68s)]
*  deal with the United Kingdom? People in the UK parliament are saying, okay, well, where is this [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=523.76s)]
*  deal that was supposedly made? You said there was this deal, but we don't see a deal anywhere. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=532.16s)]
*  There was a memorandum of understanding which said this is not an actual deal. But here, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=538.88s)]
*  play this clip. Thank you, Caroline. You're welcome. It's been just about a month since [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=542.72s)]
*  President and Prime Minister Starmor announced- I can't see you all the way back there. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=548.88s)]
*  It's been just about a month since Prime Minister Starmor and President Trump announced that the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=558.0s)]
*  US and UK had reached a trade deal, reached a framework for the deal. Now there are at least [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=562.96s)]
*  some conservative MPs in London who are complaining that parliament has not yet seen [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=569.92s)]
*  the text of any deal. So I'd like to ask you from this side of the pond, is there a text for the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=575.92s)]
*  deal ready to be released, submitted? And if not, when can we expect it? And then I have one more. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=583.36s)]
*  There is most definitely text with this deal. There is language that this side has seen. You'll [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=590.4799999999999s)]
*  have to ask the UK parliament why they haven't seen it from their own government. I obviously [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=595.12s)]
*  can't answer that question. Caroline, one more on Ukraine, please. Next up, Kaitlyn Collins from [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=599.2s)]
*  CNN asks Caroline Levitt what her thoughts are about other MAGA Republicans like Ron Johnson [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=604.6400000000001s)]
*  and Rand Paul saying that this budget bill will substantially increase the deficit. Play this clip. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=613.2800000000001s)]
*  Kaitlyn. Two questions for you as well. On the big beautiful bill, you said recently that it is [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=619.0400000000001s)]
*  quote blatantly wrong to say that it adds to the deficit. You essentially said that an estimate [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=623.2800000000001s)]
*  from the Congressional Budget Office and other scorekeepers you believe are wrong. But Republicans [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=627.68s)]
*  like Ron Johnson and Rand Paul disagree. They are saying that it will add to the deficit. That is [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=632.2399999999999s)]
*  their concern. Is the White House's position that those two Republican senators are quote blatantly [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=636.7199999999999s)]
*  wrong? It is. Those senators, it's not news that they disagree with this president on policy. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=641.4399999999999s)]
*  And the president has vocally called them out for it and for their not having their facts together. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=646.9599999999999s)]
*  Then Caroline Levitt attacks the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, a nonpartisan group, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=652.56s)]
*  which is inside Congress. And she goes, oh, you know, they've never donated to Republicans [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=658.4799999999999s)]
*  since 2000. They're a leftist organization. No, no, no, they're not. The head of the CBO [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=664.7199999999999s)]
*  was appointed by the Republicans in the Senate. But go ahead, play the clip. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=670.8s)]
*  So point out, I don't think many people know this. There hasn't been a single staffer in the entire [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=676.0799999999999s)]
*  Congressional Budget Office that has contributed to a Republican since the year 2000. But guess [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=681.52s)]
*  what? There have been many staffers within the Congressional Budget Office who have contributed [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=687.1999999999999s)]
*  to Democrat candidates and politicians every single cycle since. So unfortunately, this is an [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=691.12s)]
*  institution in our country that has become partisan and political. And we are very confident in our [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=697.1999999999999s)]
*  own economic analyses of this bill. There is $1.6 trillion in savings. And our Office of Management [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=702.0799999999999s)]
*  and Budget Director, Russ Fott, is a fiscal hawk. He is well known in this city for being [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=708.72s)]
*  a well-respected fiscal hawk. He has tools at his disposal to produce even more savings. And as you [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=713.44s)]
*  know, the White House will be sending our rescissions package to Capitol Hill today. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=719.6800000000001s)]
*  And on to the group. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=723.6s)]
*  Next up, Caroline Levitt is asked about, was there anything in particular that caused Donald Trump to [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=724.48s)]
*  withdraw the nomination of Jared Isaacman to lead NASA? Remember, Isaacman was Elon Musk's guy, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=731.12s)]
*  handpicked guy to run NASA. And you see kind of this war going on between Trump and Musk. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  As soon as Musk left the White House, Trump gets rid of Isaacman as kind of an FU to Elon. Elon [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=745.6s)]
*  then does an FU to Trump and attacks the budget bill. Watch this playlist clip. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=751.84s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=756.24s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=756.64s)]
*  Brett. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=757.2s)]
*  Thanks, Caroline. I wanted to ask, a couple days ago, the President announced [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=757.92s)]
*  he was withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to lead NASA, citing a thorough [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=762.4s)]
*  review of prior associations. I wondered why did this review happen just now after the nominee was [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=768.88s)]
*  so far into the process? And can you explain the President's thinking on who he might choose? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=774.16s)]
*  Look, the President reserves the right to nominate individuals to key administration posts. He also [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=778.4s)]
*  reserves the right to remove those individuals if he chooses, just like he reserves the right to [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=782.9599999999999s)]
*  fire anybody in the executive branch that he wants. And so a new replacement for NASA [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=787.68s)]
*  will be announced very soon, as the President himself said. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=792.56s)]
*  Was there something in particular that came up that caused the President concern with this [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=794.9599999999999s)]
*  nomination? The President wants to ensure that all of his nominees are aligned fully with the [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=798.0s)]
*  America First mission of this administration. And again, he will be announcing a replacement very [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=802.88s)]
*  soon. Caroline Levitt is next asked by a reporter that the new head of FEMA said that he doesn't [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=807.68s)]
*  know what hurricane season is, to which Caroline Levitt says that was a joke. He was just being [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=814.56s)]
*  funny. Of course he knows what hurricane season is. That's just how we do jokes in the Trump [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=820.8s)]
*  White House. Here, play this clip. Kelly. Good afternoon. We're now in hurricane season, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=825.68s)]
*  and obviously there is great concern every year about the potential for that. Can you speak to [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=832.64s)]
*  how the President is planning to have the level of support, should it be needed, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=839.2s)]
*  to be as it has been with a reduction in the workforce? And is he still comfortable with [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=847.12s)]
*  Administrator Richardson, who had talked, whether joking or not, about not being aware of a hurricane [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=851.84s)]
*  season for this country? What is the President's level of briefings on what may be required? If [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=857.28s)]
*  you could give us kind of an overall update on that. Sure. Well, of course we know that we are [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=863.04s)]
*  into hurricane season now, and I know FEMA is taking this seriously, contrary to some of the [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=867.52s)]
*  reporting we have seen based on jokes that were made and leaks from meetings. But Secretary [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=874.24s)]
*  Christine Ohm and the FEMA leadership are all over this. They are committed to ensuring that [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=879.6s)]
*  federal resources and tax dollars are there for Americans in need, and the President continues [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=884.0799999999999s)]
*  to review requests for emergency aid and carefully considering them. However, this President has made [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=889.12s)]
*  it clear we are not going to enable states to make bad decisions with federal tax dollars and [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=894.4s)]
*  then have the federal government later have to bail these states out. We want to see states be [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=898.72s)]
*  responsible with their tax dollars to do as much as they possibly can, and then the President [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=904.0s)]
*  will deeply and thoughtfully consider any requests for federal aid that come to his desk. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=908.48s)]
*  I think some of the media reporting we have seen on this is frankly sloppy and irresponsible. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=915.12s)]
*  There are serious people who are taking this issue seriously, starting with the President himself, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=919.84s)]
*  who as you know on his first domestic trip back in office, visited both North Carolina and California, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=925.0400000000001s)]
*  both of which were of course hit by natural disasters when he wasn't even President, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=931.6s)]
*  but he took ownership of that and visited those places and those people immediately. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=935.6800000000001s)]
*  Is it true that the hurricane season is appropriate now that we are in serious business? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=939.6800000000001s)]
*  It's serious business, Kelly, and I'm not going to engage in such fodder with a question like that. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=945.0400000000001s)]
*  Brian. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=949.28s)]
*  Thank you, Caroline. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=949.76s)]
*  Then naturally the reporter said, so you think jokes about hurricane season from the head of [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=950.72s)]
*  FEMA is supposed to be funny? Play the clip. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=955.92s)]
*  I think about hurricane season appropriate though now that we're, this is serious business [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=957.92s)]
*  as you talked about. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=962.08s)]
*  It's serious business, Kelly, and I'm not going to engage in such fodder with a question like that. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=962.96s)]
*  Brian. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=967.04s)]
*  Then Caroline Levitt is asked if Donald Trump approves of Ukraine striking Russia and that [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=967.28s)]
*  incredible drone strike that got rid of about 31% of Russia's strategic air force fleet. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=973.9200000000001s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=980.24s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=981.2s)]
*  Thank you. Same topic, just to put a finer point on it. Does President Trump approve [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=981.84s)]
*  of Ukraine's decision to strike nuclear-capable bombers in Russia? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=986.88s)]
*  I would like to let the President speak on that himself. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=991.84s)]
*  And just a follow-up, has the President? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=994.1600000000001s)]
*  I would just add to that. The President does not want to see this war prolonged. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=996.72s)]
*  fighting to stop. He wants people to stop dying and he wants this to be solved at the negotiating [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=1001.28s)]
*  table. The reason he is so deeply involved and has spent so much time and effort on this war [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=1006.24s)]
*  is because he hates to see people dying. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=1012.32s)]
*  There you have it. One of the most disastrous press conferences I've seen, unprepared, dangerous, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=1014.5600000000001s)]
*  propaganda. That's what comes to mind when I watch that. Tell me what you think. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4ZEQEGQiM&t=1022.8000000000001s)]
