# Trump LOSES IT as PANIC over FULL COLLAPSE Sets In
**MeidasTouch:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU)
*  When I say that Donald Trump is a felon, a fraud, and a sexual abuser, it's because he's those things. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=0.0s)]
*  He's also a bankruptor. He's a destroyer, not a builder. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=5.12s)]
*  And so when you see Donald Trump make a post like he did last night saying that great progress was made in the trade talks with China, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=10.24s)]
*  we're going to do a total reset in our economic relations with China, this is going to be great. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=17.76s)]
*  Trump is a con artist. Now look, I hope that our economy can do great, but Trump, you wrecked it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=25.84s)]
*  You declared a trade war against the world. You have been saying that tariffs are the greatest thing ever. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  Then why are you negotiating to remove the tariffs? If you're saying the tariffs are the greatest thing ever, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=42.08s)]
*  you have your Treasury Secretary saying this is all part of the, this is a direct quote, crazy Ivan strategy, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=48.64s)]
*  where Donald Trump injects strategic uncertainty into the markets, and then we try to make deals in periods of strategic uncertainty, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=57.36s)]
*  which is no, it's just Donald Trump waking up posting deranged and demented things and screwing over Main Street, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=67.6s)]
*  and then manipulating the markets and helping his billionaire and oligarch friends, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=74.24s)]
*  while we the people don't even know if our small businesses and medium-sized businesses are going to be able to survive, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  because we don't get the special exemptions that Apple and all of Donald and Bezos and all of these people get. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=85.36s)]
*  So here's what Donald Trump posted last night after the first day of discussions between China and the United States [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  over Donald Trump's trade war against China and the world. America has 145% tariffs against China. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=100.8s)]
*  China has similar tariffs against the United States. There's an effective trade embargo. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  Shipments are not coming into our ports anymore. We're about to run out of goods and products that are not going to be on these shelves. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=113.68s)]
*  And so here's what Donald Trump posts. He goes, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=121.36s)]
*  Great progress made! [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=130.72s)]
*  You know, it's almost like the arsonist showing up at the scene of the fire and basically saying, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=142.72s)]
*  look, I'm going to try to put this all out. Let me be the hero. A total reset of the fire that was created. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=149.92s)]
*  You made the mess. And then when Donald Trump uses language like a total reset negotiated, and again, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=156.32s)]
*  Donald, aren't you saying that tariffs are the greatest things? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=164.0s)]
*  So if tariffs are the greatest thing in the world and we're getting super rich with 145% tariffs on China, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=167.2s)]
*  and as you said in press conference after press conference, you think it's a great thing that ships aren't coming into our ports, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=174.56s)]
*  then why are you trying to negotiate deals that are going to remove the tariffs and reset that? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=181.2s)]
*  Shouldn't you be celebrating how rich we are? No, because it's all a scam. It's all a fraud. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=185.76s)]
*  It's to help Donald Trump's rich billionaire oligarch friends. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=191.04s)]
*  And all we should be talking about, whether you're a Democrat or whatever, as human beings, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  what we should be talking about is allowing people who work hard to live in a freaking home, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  to allow people who work hard to just have one job and get wages where they are paid with dignity [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=205.28s)]
*  and they're not living paycheck to paycheck, where they can have health care, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  where they can have a good education, where they're not going to be disrespected and defamed by oligarchs [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  like Elon Musk, who says that I'm firing you because you're not doing a good job for performance reasons [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=222.32s)]
*  when you are working your ass off. I want to make sure we're protecting our veterans who sacrifice [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=228.16s)]
*  for our country, not firing them and treating them like crap. And I don't want to ever see people [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=234.0s)]
*  punch down at marginalized communities and gut essential services that help and keep people alive. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=239.6s)]
*  I can tell a myriad of stories of what the Trump regime is doing. I could give you one example where [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=245.76s)]
*  they're eliminating research in a Cornell that is aimed to help babies who have heart disease, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=251.12s)]
*  you know, right out the womb. And this could save their lives. They're like destroying programs like [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=259.28s)]
*  that. I can tell you how the Trump regime is getting rid of two billion dollars in mental health [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=264.96s)]
*  programs at schools when the MAGA Republicans blame all these school shootings in the United States [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  on mental health issues. I could tell you about how the Trump regime wants to eliminate all [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=278.32s)]
*  Section 8 housing. They're getting rid of what, twenty five billion dollars from HUD and what's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=284.32s)]
*  going to make the homeless problem here worse. And you know, and you're just great progress, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=291.44s)]
*  total reset. You created the problem, you freaking fraud, you felon, you sexual abuser. You created [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=296.88s)]
*  the problem. You know, and his words are so cheap other than to manipulate the markets for his [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=304.08s)]
*  oligarch friend. Remember earlier in the day yesterday when he said, after a long night of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=310.0s)]
*  talks mediated by the United States, I'm pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=315.92s)]
*  to a full and immediate ceasefire. And then like moments later they started attacking each other [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  again. And then people said the United States had nothing to do with this. And now you have [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  Pakistan like, you know, again, you know, looking into like their nuclear committees meeting, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  have, you know, things are escalating. And so, you know, the talk is cheap. The talk is usually [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=339.36s)]
*  fraud from this guy. And they, but they move the markets. They make things volatile. And even if [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=345.6s)]
*  you remove the tariffs, what now corporate media is supposed to praise you and say, oh, this is such [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  a brilliant deal he did. You caused the problem. What are we even talking about here, folks? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=357.44s)]
*  I want you to take a look at this here as well. Just so you see how cheap his words are. He [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=363.12s)]
*  posts this 99% approval is what he's saying his approval rating is. And what he's citing is a [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=369.28s)]
*  CPAC, one of these right-wing convention balls right here. And then you take a look at the Y [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  access where it says that he has a 99% approval. The Y access goes up to 120%. So I don't know, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=381.2s)]
*  I think someone said this. I don't know what's more comical here. Him saying his approval rating [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=389.44s)]
*  is greater than Kim Jong Un's in North Korea, or that the Y access goes to 120%. And just to see [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=393.6s)]
*  the other things that Donald Trump is posting, he's posting attacks on New York Attorney General [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=401.68s)]
*  Letitia James like from hashtag me to crusader to cover up Letitia James silence. I mean, attacking [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=406.8s)]
*  her. Let's go into what the actual facts are to see who actually has the cards in these negotiations [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=413.52s)]
*  between China and the US. China saw the US tariffs coming as Robin Brooks writes. China's trade [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=420.56s)]
*  surplus with the US collapsed in April 2025, but its surplus with other countries began rising in [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=426.56s)]
*  January 2025, which more than up which more than offsets the fall. US tariffs trapped a wall of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=432.56s)]
*  goods in China that need to get out. Those goods are definitely getting out to other places, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=439.92s)]
*  just not getting out to the United States of America. And we were seeing how close we came [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=445.2s)]
*  to having no goods on the shelves. So we'll keep you posted on what's going on with these negotiations, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=450.8s)]
*  but that's where we're at right now. I mean, you also have Donald Trump posting things like this. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=457.44s)]
*  Today I signed an executive order to launch the first ever self deportation program. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=462.48s)]
*  Illegal aliens who stay in America face punishments, including sudden deportation in a place and manner [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  solely of our discretion. And he puts this in caps to all illegal aliens. Book your free flight [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=476.88s)]
*  right now. Let me be very clear. This statement is unlawful for a variety of reasons when he says, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=483.68s)]
*  including sudden deportation in a place and manner solely in our discretion. That's Donald Trump [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=490.0s)]
*  saying basically that he wants to suspend habeas corpus, that there's no due process. If they want [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  to send you to Libya, they'll send you to Libya. If they want to send you to concentration camps in [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=500.8s)]
*  El Salvador, they'll send you to concentration camps in El Salvador. And by the way, to all the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=504.32000000000005s)]
*  Venezuelans for Trump and Cubans for Trump and Latinos for Trump, I thought you said that he was [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=508.8s)]
*  just going to be going after the criminals because it seems here what he's saying is once he revokes [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=513.6s)]
*  your temporary protected status, which he's trying to do, he'll send you wherever the hell [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=518.88s)]
*  he wants to send you. And unless you self deport yourself. Now, I also want to talk about the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=523.36s)]
*  incongruity of news that like the right wing's getting the left wing's getting, because I think [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=529.92s)]
*  this goes to a key point right here. So right now there's something called the Canadian Snowbird Act, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=536.0s)]
*  which has been proposed in the U.S. Congress. It's actually one of the few things that are being [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=543.2s)]
*  proposed on a bipartisan basis. And it's Congress, both Congress members and senators trying to [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=547.68s)]
*  reach out to Canadians in order to get Canadians to stay in the United States longer. We know [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=554.64s)]
*  Canadians have gone elbows up. They're not traveling to the United States anymore. And they're [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=560.88s)]
*  not buying by and large lots of American products. But on a bipartisan basis, people realize that [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=565.5999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump's attack on Canada is not a good thing. But of course, they don't want you to know [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=571.44s)]
*  this on right wing media. So there's not a single right wing media that's reported on that, which I [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=577.6800000000001s)]
*  think is an interesting data point as well. I'll show you what right wing media is reporting on in [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=583.84s)]
*  a second, but it's essential for me to get my research right. And one of the tools that I use [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=588.1600000000001s)]
*  is something called ground news. It's essential nowadays to see through any double standards in [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=594.08s)]
*  the current media ecosphere. Here's what I want you to do. Go to ground.news.mtn or scan the QR [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=599.44s)]
*  code. We're giving our viewers 40% off ground news's top tier vantage plan, which I use to do the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  research I'm doing right now. And it'll get you unlimited access to everything I use and more. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=612.4000000000001s)]
*  Ground news is subscriber funded, so they don't rely on ads that could also introduce bias. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=617.9200000000001s)]
*  Subscribing supports our channel and their independent team working to keep the media [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=622.8000000000001s)]
*  transparent. So go to ground.news.mtn or scan the QR code and get that 40% off ground news's top [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=628.0799999999999s)]
*  tier vantage plan. And what I use there is a feature called blind spot, where I find what are [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=636.4s)]
*  they not talking about in the right wing ecosphere. Now let's talk about what these MAGA Republicans [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=642.88s)]
*  are actually talking about on their right wing echo chambers. They have all these MAGA Republican [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=647.6s)]
*  media people and members of Congress who keep on going to the concentration camps [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=654.24s)]
*  in El Salvador, which by the way, it's a violation of the Geneva Convention to [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=659.6s)]
*  parade yourself in front of a group of prisoners like that in order to use them as props. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=663.76s)]
*  But here you have Matt Gaetz and MAGA Republican Congress member Andy Ogles right there, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=671.6s)]
*  as our editor in chief Ron Filipkowski calls it. Is this like MAGA porn hour? What the hell are they [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=679.2s)]
*  doing there? And then you have Matt Gaetz bragging about the OAN exclusive first look, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=684.56s)]

*  there's something called due process in the United States. You go through the process. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=697.5999999999999s)]

*  simple. If you don't believe in due process, then you don't believe in the United States system. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=707.12s)]
*  That's what this is all about. It should not even be a debate that is taking place. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=712.3199999999999s)]

*  these other nations. Take a look at what Trump's also been posting as well. Attacking wind energy, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=733.28s)]
*  how the global wind power industry is losing steam. On January 20th, Trump's first day in [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=741.28s)]
*  office, he wasted no time delivering a death knell to the offshore wind industry. And again, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=747.8399999999999s)]
*  why would you be celebrating giving a death knell to offshore wind industry or wind in general, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=754.8s)]
*  which is supplying power to lots of places in America, creating lots of jobs. It's good energy, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=761.76s)]

*  well, just so you see what the regime is actually focused on, the Pentagon, Department of Defense [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=786.8s)]

*  service members out of the military. So any transgender people who were sacrificing their [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAjHVchMBU&t=800.56s)]
