# Trump gets RUDE AWAKENING in DISASTER Friday Morning
**MeidasTouch:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU)
*  Wow, Donald Trump is not taking this fight with Elon Musk well at all. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=0.0s)]
*  He's having a truly unhinged morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=6.12s)]
*  This is what he posted. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  The Trump meme coin is a tracker of President's success. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=11.76s)]
*  Almost everyone is talking about the meme coin with a special focus on the big game [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=18.04s)]
*  changer, the Trump meme coin. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=23.2s)]
*  The coin is aptly called dollar sign Trump. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=26.32s)]
*  It's a repost of a Newsmax article, but that's what he's posting. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  We know Donald Trump frequently looks at the New York Post. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=35.28s)]
*  Look at this humiliating front page of the New York Post. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=38.8s)]
*  It says, I hate my ex with a broken heart of Elon Musk and Donald Trump. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=42.56s)]
*  Here's what Trump's telling the media after Elon Musk has called for Donald Trump to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=50.84s)]
*  be impeached after Elon Musk said that Donald Trump is covering up the Epstein files because [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=56.36000000000001s)]
*  Trump's in the files and that mark that post for later will all uncover the truth about [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=62.56s)]
*  Trump and Epstein. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=68.64s)]
*  As Elon Musk is saying that Donald Trump would not have won the 2024 election if it wasn't [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  for Elon Musk. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=77.34s)]
*  Once Donald Trump's response, he goes, I'm going to take the high road. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=79.64s)]
*  I'm not even thinking about Elon. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=84.04s)]
*  He's got a problem. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=86.68s)]
*  The poor guy has got a problem. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=88.24s)]
*  Clearly, Donald Trump does not want to talk about his connection in the Epstein files. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=91.24s)]
*  This is what Donald Trump told ABC. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=97.4s)]
*  You mean the man who's lost his mind? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=99.6s)]
*  You mean the crazy man? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=101.82s)]
*  Oh, I don't want to talk about him right now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=103.08s)]
*  Well, the whole world is talking about this and laughing at Donald Trump and the United [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=107.0s)]
*  States as FedWatch writes, the Musk Trump fight displays a weakening of the power play, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=111.64s)]
*  which is what China will leverage. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=119.84s)]
*  Trump is completely folding to China's demands, making de-escalation a recurring issue. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=122.30000000000001s)]
*  In other words, the day to day weirdo stuff that's going on in the United States makes [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  the US look incredibly weak. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=134.8s)]
*  And the power play here is China going to other countries in Southeast Asia, going [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=137.68s)]
*  to Europe, going to South America, Central America, Mexico, and Africa, and saying, you [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  see what's going on over there in the US? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  They are not a stable country. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=153.36s)]
*  It is a dystopian, bizarre reality show. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=155.96s)]
*  You can't do business with them. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=160.12s)]
*  Come over here. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=162.12s)]
*  Let's have a chat. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=164.11999999999998s)]
*  And while Donald Trump and Musk are involved in all of these just embarrassing public fights, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  here's what Dmitry Novikov, the first deputy chairman in Russia had to say to their state [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=172.92s)]
*  regime media. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=180.6s)]
*  He says, he will not need any political asylum. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=182.92s)]
*  We don't think Musk will need political asylum, but if he did, Russia would be happy to provide [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=186.33999999999997s)]
*  Musk with political asylum. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=192.16s)]
*  They're mocking us. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=194.84s)]
*  They're mocking us here right now. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=196.56s)]
*  And that's the statements coming out of Russia. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=198.44s)]
*  Donald Trump, panic post after panic post like this one over here, and he's attacking [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=201.6s)]
*  the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  And Trump's pretending like we got good job numbers when we didn't get good job numbers. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=210.96s)]
*  Unemployment is ticking up. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=216.32s)]
*  We had a revision of the last two months where we lost 95,000 additional jobs than were previously [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=218.68s)]
*  reported as a result of a downward revision that was made. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=227.12s)]
*  So here's Trump's post this morning. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=230.72s)]
*  Too late at the Fed is a disaster. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=232.96s)]
*  He refers to the chairman of the Federal Reserve as too late. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=235.8s)]
*  Europe has had 10 rate cuts. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=239.8s)]
*  We have had none. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  Despite him, our country is doing great. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  Go for a full point. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=245.44s)]
*  Rocket fuel. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=246.96s)]
*  And then Donald Trump puts this all in caps. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=247.96s)]
*  America is hot. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=250.32000000000002s)]
*  Six months ago, it was cold as ice. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=251.72s)]
*  Border is closed. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=254.08s)]
*  Prices are down. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=255.16s)]
*  Wages are up. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=256.56s)]
*  And I just ask you, when you go into a grocery store, convenience store, department store, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=257.72s)]
*  wherever, do you see the prices down? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=264.8s)]
*  Because they're not. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=267.6s)]
*  The prices are up. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=268.88s)]
*  Housing is less affordable, not more affordable. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=271.76s)]
*  There's no peace in Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=275.2s)]
*  All of Donald Trump's promises are lies. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=279.36s)]
*  And then he lies on top of the lies. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=282.24s)]
*  He says gas is $1.99. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=284.84s)]
*  No, it isn't. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=286.8s)]
*  It isn't. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=288.2s)]
*  It isn't anywhere. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=289.2s)]
*  And he just thinks he'll lie his way and Ponzi scheme his way out of it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=290.84s)]
*  On a rounded basis, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.244% in May from 4.18% in April. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=295.2s)]
*  The high last year was 4.231% in November. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=305.24s)]
*  So right now, currently, while Donald Trump's saying this is hot, everything's hot, he says. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=310.12s)]
*  It's a weird thing to say. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=316.12s)]
*  This is the highest unrounded print unemployment since October of 2021, getting out of COVID. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=318.0s)]
*  It's the worst unemployment number since October 2021. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=328.72s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=332.68s)]
*  And as Heather Long says, this is an abundance of caution economy. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=334.4s)]
*  Companies outside of health care and restaurants are hesitant to hire. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=339.52s)]
*  Temporary help jobs are being slashed. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  Professional and business services aren't hiring. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=347.47999999999996s)]
*  Manufacturing is cutting jobs. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=350.84s)]
*  Even retail is shedding jobs. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=352.56s)]
*  We lost 8,000 manufacturing jobs. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=355.23999999999995s)]
*  Trump's saying, I've made manufacturing better. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=360.88s)]
*  We've lost 8,000 manufacturing jobs. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=364.92s)]
*  So Lori Chavez-Dreamer, Trump's labor secretary, went on Fox. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=369.08s)]
*  And the Fox host said, this isn't good. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=374.28000000000003s)]
*  You've lost 8,000 manufacturing jobs. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=376.92s)]
*  So why are you bragging about that? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=379.32s)]
*  And here's what Lori Chavez-Dreamer says. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=382.8s)]
*  And you'll notice it's just a bunch of word salad. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=386.24s)]
*  What she says here, play this clip. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=390.0s)]
*  Now, 8,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in May. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=392.08s)]
*  That's not what you wanted to see. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=396.68s)]
*  Well, we're certainly holding steady. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=400.68s)]
*  And under the Trump administration, manufacturing jobs are still up over what [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=402.28s)]
*  the last administration under Biden had. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=406.84s)]
*  The focus of my America at Work tour is to increase those manufacturing jobs. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=409.44s)]
*  And we'll continue to stay laser focused on that as the president continues to double down [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=413.88s)]
*  on how important this is to the American economy. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=419.36s)]
*  But how come we're losing 8,000 manufacturing jobs in May? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  And when there's a big push to bring manufacturing jobs back to America, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=425.92s)]
*  how come we're losing those jobs? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=429.64s)]
*  Well, we're certainly holding steady. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=433.08000000000004s)]
*  And as we increase construction jobs, as we increase health care jobs, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=434.6s)]
*  and again, that focus on building those manufacturing plants, it will take some time. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=439.76s)]
*  The president has done a wonderful job in negotiating the level playing field. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, as far as the tariff discussions have gone, but those onshore [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  and of those jobs, we're seeing tens of trillions of dollars being reinvested [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=454.28s)]
*  here in the United States. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=458.12s)]
*  And I'll continue to focus on that skilled workforce as those manufacturing jobs [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=459.32s)]
*  continue to grow. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=463.2s)]
*  You notice how she didn't answer the question and she started talking about health care [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=464.76s)]
*  and she said things are stabilizing under former President Biden. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=468.8s)]
*  We had a manufacturing boom. OK. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=472.84s)]
*  It's very important, I think, that we have and we consume a healthy news diet. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=477.48s)]
*  It's why I'm always looking to see what's the right wing echo chamber saying? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=484.56s)]
*  What are they saying on the left wing? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=488.88s)]
*  What's the so-called center saying? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=490.8s)]
*  Well, what's being reported out there? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=494.04s)]
*  And I'm able to find trends. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=497.4s)]
*  You know, for example, anything that's positive about NATO, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=499.92s)]
*  you'll never see the right wing really talk about at all. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=504.2s)]
*  Which is which is notable, you know, for this video and for all my videos, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=509.48s)]
*  I use a research tool called Blind Spot and it's on ground news. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=514.0s)]
*  Ground news is the overall research tool and blind spot is a feature that I use [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=519.16s)]
*  where I see how many people on the left or right are covering a specific issue. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=523.8s)]
*  And it informs the way I do my takes here. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=529.2s)]
*  For me, ground news is essential [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=533.12s)]
*  to see through any double standards in the current media ecosphere. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=536.2800000000001s)]
*  Go to ground news, M.T.N. or scan the QR code. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=539.9200000000001s)]
*  We're giving our viewers 40 percent off of ground news. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=543.88s)]
*  Top tier vantage plan, which will get you unlimited access [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=547.24s)]
*  to everything I've shown you and more. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  You go to ground news slash M.T.N. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=553.5600000000001s)]
*  Go and check that out and get that 40 percent. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=558.12s)]
*  Get that 40 percent off right now. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=561.48s)]
*  It's a great research tool that I'm using here. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=563.08s)]
*  Let's take a look over here at [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=566.88s)]
*  what are they saying on the right wing about Elon Musk exposing [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=569.76s)]
*  Trump's participation in the Epstein list, or is what Elon said about Trump? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=573.36s)]
*  This is what Newsmax is saying, for example. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=578.52s)]
*  Here, let's play this clip. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=581.2s)]
*  Still love Trump. And I really like Elon. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=582.6s)]
*  This is just a really crappy scenario right now. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=585.32s)]
*  And I really hope these two can patch these things up [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=588.0s)]
*  because I think Elon took a low blow by tweeting that, quote, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=590.4s)]
*  DJT was on the Epstein client list. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=593.48s)]
*  I mean, something that he knows can't be immediately verified. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=595.76s)]
*  Also, if Trump was on that island doing something illegal [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=598.24s)]
*  after all the legal battles that Biden threw at him, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=602.24s)]
*  if he had done something illegal with Jeffrey Epstein, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=605.08s)]
*  you would think they would have thrown that at him. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=607.92s)]
*  No, they pulled out the stops on everything else. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=610.0s)]
*  The only thing we can point to that was a known association [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=613.32s)]
*  with Epstein was that he was at his club once. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=616.0s)]
*  And by the way, Trump kicked him out of that club [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=618.48s)]
*  because of reported bad behavior. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=621.12s)]
*  And also, Elon, if you knew he was on the Epstein client list, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=623.6800000000001s)]
*  why did you let him board Marine One with your son? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=628.08s)]
*  Just asking. But the best thing for Trump to do now [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=631.24s)]
*  is to release the list, something that also our FBI and Pam [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=635.32s)]
*  Bondi have promised us. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=638.28s)]
*  Now, on the right wing, what is Charlie Kirk saying about [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=640.32s)]
*  Elon's fight with Donald Trump? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=644.48s)]
*  Play this clip. Let's talk about the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=646.36s)]
*  the perspective here of where we as a movement go next. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=650.2800000000001s)]
*  Is it best to largely ignore this? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=654.9200000000001s)]
*  I think that's probably best. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=657.0s)]
*  We kind of have the blow up dust up again. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=658.84s)]
*  This alternatively could have been like a two week feud [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=660.6800000000001s)]
*  and it still might be. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=664.44s)]
*  But like, again, when you accuse someone of being in the Epstein files [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=665.44s)]
*  Oh, and they also want to be impeached, right? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=667.7600000000001s)]
*  Is that right? OK. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=669.6800000000001s)]
*  Interestingly, though, he might still be pro JD [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=671.6s)]
*  because he was like, I want Trump replacement JD. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=674.44s)]
*  So whatever. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=677.36s)]
*  And then meanwhile, you have Donald Trump continuing just to post [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=678.44s)]
*  and post away like this, the failing New York Times and the Washington [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=681.6s)]
*  Compost, two papers that have ruthlessly fought me for years, have each done polls [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=685.48s)]
*  or a vast majority of those sampled their Democrats. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=691.24s)]
*  In other words, the polls, just like their writings are rigged. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=694.12s)]
*  It's not possible for a Republican to do well in such a poll. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=697.48s)]
*  They are corrupt as hell. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=701.28s)]
*  The real polls just whiny. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=702.8399999999999s)]
*  It's just whiny, whiny, whiny stuff. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=706.16s)]
*  This came from a mega Republican congresswoman, Mary Miller, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=709.3199999999999s)]
*  tell you what they think about people. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=713.9599999999999s)]
*  She goes, It's deeply troubling that a Sikh was allowed to lead prayer [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=716.04s)]
*  in the House of Representatives this morning. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=720.5999999999999s)]
*  This should have never been allowed to happen. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=723.0s)]
*  America was founded as a Christian nation, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=724.76s)]
*  and I believe our government should reflect that truth, not drift further from it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=727.5999999999999s)]
*  May God have mercy. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=732.88s)]
*  She posted it and then she deleted it. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=734.12s)]
*  One of the things we're also learning this morning as well. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=736.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, we've been reporting about it for a long time, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=739.4799999999999s)]
*  but it was in the Washington Post this morning. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=741.76s)]
*  The Trump administration is very quietly behind the scenes [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=744.3199999999999s)]
*  racing to rehire a lot of people that they fired from government agencies [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=748.52s)]
*  because the government is collapsing and they need these jobs to do the actual work. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=753.3199999999999s)]
*  So they're reaching back out to the people and saying, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=758.92s)]
*  actually, can you please come back? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=760.8s)]
*  We know we fired you and we defamed you, but we need you at the IRS. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=762.68s)]
*  We need you at this agency. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=766.3199999999999s)]
*  We need you at this agency. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=768.1999999999999s)]
*  Maybe we shouldn't have fired you. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=769.56s)]
*  Another point that I think will become a bit. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=772.0s)]
*  I always like to tell you also what I think will become the bigger stories [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=774.0799999999999s)]
*  in the future and what to look for. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=779.76s)]
*  And that's the World Cup and the Olympics in the United States, Canada, Mexico. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=781.88s)]
*  We're hosting the Olympics here and then the World Cup in Canada, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=789.16s)]
*  Mexico and the US, you know, with Trump's travel ban. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=792.24s)]
*  The only exemptions are for the athletes themselves, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=797.16s)]
*  not even their family members and not their fans. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=801.84s)]
*  And US Customs and Border Patrol is going to be the one of the primary agencies [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=805.0799999999999s)]
*  that's going to be providing protection and security at these events. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=810.96s)]
*  The group that will be doing deportations claims that they're going to be doing security. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=816.36s)]
*  And so I think as we get closer to FIFA, as we get closer to all these things, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=821.8s)]
*  I think we're going to start to see that becoming a bigger story. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=827.44s)]
*  And I want you all to start focusing on that, because I think soon enough, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=832.24s)]
*  that's going to be a major issue. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=837.4s)]
*  Will foreign countries be sending their people here to the United States? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=838.68s)]
*  So that's what I got for us this morning. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=843.56s)]
*  We'll keep you posted with more. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IonBb97IpiU&t=846.4399999999999s)]
