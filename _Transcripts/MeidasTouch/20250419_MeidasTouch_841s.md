# Trump has MASSIVE PANIC on Saturday WORRYING CABINET
**MeidasTouch:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4)
*  Donald Trump is panicking on Saturday morning that his actions are going to cause a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=0.0s)]
*  1929 style Great Depression [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=6.0600000000000005s)]
*  There are leaks from his inner circle saying Donald Trump is running around the White House right now [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=8.4s)]
*  fretting about [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=15.88s)]
*  1929 and causing a [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=18.1s)]
*  1929 event now folks when I label the titles of these YouTube videos Trump panics [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  It's because he actually is panicking now [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=27.52s)]
*  Donald Trump may try to project the image of a strong man of an authoritarian [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  But he is not and the rest of the world leaders know how weak and pathetic he is [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=38.04s)]
*  You don't want to believe me take a look at the headline from the New York Times [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  After we've been reporting about this for weeks risk of financial panic [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  tempers Trump on firing Powell [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=56.0s)]
*  President Trump again attacked the chair of the Federal Reserve this week [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=58.96s)]
*  But advisors say the president has turned more cautious on policies that could that could stoke [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  extreme financial volatility again [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=69.76s)]
*  And it goes and if you read the article it says for months mr [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=72.48s)]
*  Trump has privately [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=76.92s)]
*  Fretted about the prospect of a Great Depression scale event happening on his watch a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=78.84s)]
*  scenario he shorthands in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=86.56s)]
*  conversations as [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=89.12s)]
*  1929 Scott am I going to cause a [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=91.36s)]
*  1929 Howard am I going to cause a [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  1929 and so Besant and Howard Lutnick have to try to wall off one of Donald Trump's other [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=99.72s)]
*  Economic advisors Peter Navarro because Navarro wants to push more tariffs and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=108.3s)]
*  Besant and Lutnick try to keep Navarro away [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=114.61999999999999s)]
*  And then this article from the Wall Street Journal talks about how they try to say hey Donald [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=117.74s)]
*  We don't want to cause a 1929 either Donald. We don't want to do [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=123.06s)]
*  1929 so that's why you need to pause the tariffs and listen to us not Navarro [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=127.66s)]
*  This is how the Wall Street Journal reports it [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=133.3s)]
*  So the morning where the tariffs were paused when Navarro was in a different part of the White House [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=135.62s)]
*  Besant and Lutnick made their move they rushed to the Oval Office to propose a pause [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=141.9s)]
*  They stayed until Trump actually typed it out on a truth social post [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=149.02s)]
*  hovering over them as [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=155.06s)]
*  Aaron Sojourner says this is the policy process in a Trump White House [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=156.94s)]
*  rival factions jockey for access to the Oval Office [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=164.02s)]
*  They race to get in front of Trump to run their thing up the flagpole publicly first [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=167.78s)]
*  Before another faction can shoot it down. This is not a healthy policy process [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=174.42s)]
*  It's not a process at all. It is panicking. It is how weak [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=180.66s)]
*  Unqualified people who should never be near positions of power handle things and during the campaign [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=187.1s)]
*  Donald Trump would be on stage and he would be projecting his own fears about [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=193.86s)]
*  1929 1929 this [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=200.70000000000002s)]

*  1929 will avoid it but in reality it was him saying that he is a scared little pathetic human [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=210.58s)]

*  Corruption is matched or exceeded by their incompetence [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=454.38s)]
*  Because here's another major breaking story today [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=458.42s)]
*  Trump officials blame a mistake for setting off the confrontation with Harvard an [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=462.5s)]
*  official on the administration's task force told the university that a letter demand had been sent without [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=468.78000000000003s)]
*  Authorization so this whole fight with Harvard that Harvard's higher top lawyers to fight back where this letter sent by the Trump [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=476.14s)]
*  regime said they wanted to take over the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=483.88s)]
*  Admissions process of Harvard the hiring and firing of faculty at Harvard that the Trump regime wanted to audit the political [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=486.98s)]
*  Viewpoints of students at Harvard. So now the Trump regime after Harvard fought back. They're saying whoa [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=496.14000000000004s)]
*  This was a mistake Harvard. We didn't mean to send this letter. This was like a like a draft [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=503.98s)]
*  We didn't intend to send this letter [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=509.90000000000003s)]
*  We're not sure who sent it but this wasn't actually meant to be the final version sent to you [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=511.58000000000004s)]
*  Not only that but now they're blaming. This is typical abuser personality Trump's an abuser, right? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=516.9s)]
*  He's a sexual predator abuser. He was found liable for sexual assault. He's a malignant narcissist [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=523.82s)]
*  This is what abusive personality people do they say Harvard though, even though the Trump regime made a mistake in sending you this letter [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=529.5s)]
*  It's your fault Harvard you should have known how ridiculous this letter was and not believe that the Trump regime [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=536.82s)]
*  Really meant it so we still blame you Harvard for fighting back [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=544.5s)]
*  You should have just given us a call [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=548.86s)]
*  You should have apologized to Trump and then we could have all sorted through this really [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=551.0200000000001s)]
*  We expect that the regime that's disappearing migrants to concentration camps in El Salvador [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=557.0200000000001s)]
*  without due process [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=563.94s)]
*  Accidentally sent a letter [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=566.0600000000001s)]
*  To Harvard to which Donald Trump thereafter made social media post after social media post [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=568.0600000000001s)]
*  attacking Harvard and its faculty and [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=575.3000000000001s)]
*  Confirming that he agreed with this letter one of the most pathetic things about the Trump regime [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=578.1800000000001s)]
*  honestly is the panic and that they will push these crazy brazen awful policies, right and they'll be so [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=584.1s)]
*  Sure of them and then when it's proven to backfire [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=593.26s)]
*  Because if you follow the science and data and all of the things that the Trump regime hates [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkcMn3OvbB4&t=598.26s)]
