# Trump has DISASTER SUNDAY as his REGIME SCRAMBLES
**MeidasTouch:** [April 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo)
*  On Sunday morning, Donald Trump is posting videos of himself playing golf on his social media account. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=0.0s)]
*  One post, another post of himself landing at a golf course on Marine One, which is a repost, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=7.76s)]
*  and then videos of himself golfing this as the markets are crashing, this as America experienced [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=14.64s)]
*  a day of one of the biggest nationwide protests in the history of the nation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  As Spencer Hakimian also points out, what went down on April 3rd, the stock drop, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=28.56s)]
*  was one of the biggest in the history of the United States. It was basically the same stock drop [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=35.92s)]
*  right after 9-11. And when you add up the crash of Thursday, Friday, and what appears is going to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  on Monday, it may be among the worst ever of all major crashes in the history of the United States. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=51.76s)]
*  While all of that's going on, Donald Trump is posting this. Trump is purposefully crashing [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=60.0s)]
*  the market. He's continuing to repost this bizarre video which claims that he has a plan to crash the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=65.44s)]
*  markets and that that's going to ultimately be good because he's going to lower interest rates [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  and then all the other nations are going to submit and bow down to him. He also falsely claimed in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=78.48s)]
*  that video that he posted that Warren Buffett endorses his plan and says it's a great plan. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=84.0s)]
*  Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway had to immediately put out a statement denying that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  they had anything to do with that and that they totally disagree with everything that he is doing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  I'll share this with you right here just so you can see for yourself. This is literally the video [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=100.64000000000001s)]
*  that Donald Trump posted of himself this morning as we appear to be heading towards [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=104.88s)]
*  another week of horrific stock market crashes. Let's play this clip. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=109.44s)]
*  Donald Trump also is posting this. Hang tough, we can't lose. Donald Trump is sending emails [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=124.32s)]
*  like this to his supporters. Please answer before the poll closes tonight. Would you accept a Doge [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=130.32s)]
*  dividend check signed by Trump? Should Trump give Doge savings back to American citizens via check? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=137.76s)]
*  That's why I always call the Trump regime a Ponzi scheme presidency or a rug pull presidency [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=145.12s)]
*  after they are exposed lying about one thing. There's not going to be lower prices on day one. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=151.2s)]
*  There's not going to be peace in Ukraine in 24 hours. Housing is not going to be more affordable. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=156.72s)]
*  There's not going to be more jobs. You can go down all of them. Inflation is surging. What does [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=162.16s)]
*  Donald Trump do? Well, maybe I'll hand you a check. Maybe if you beg me, I'll give you some bread crumbs. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=167.28s)]
*  That's what he's doing. Also, this morning Trump was posting these very weird videos that appear [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=172.8s)]
*  to be created by the government of Mexico. They're in English and they feature Mexican people and they [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=178.48s)]
*  say you need to be happy. Choose to be happy. Choose to be happy. Don't do drugs. Don't do [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=186.24s)]
*  fentanyl. And then there's an 800 number associated with the government of Mexico [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=192.8s)]
*  and telling Mexican people not to do fentanyl in English. Mexican people in Mexico not to do fentanyl. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=198.96s)]
*  And Donald Trump is reposting that. It's why I say this is also a very demented presidency. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=206.08s)]
*  This is what he's posting. Just think about what he's posting this morning. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=212.4s)]
*  He's posting that he's intentionally crashing the markets and he's lying and saying Warren [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=215.52s)]
*  Buffett says this is a great idea. He's posting more videos of him golfing and he's posting [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  videos by the government of Mexico in English telling Mexican people in Mexico to stop doing [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  fentanyl when there really is not a problem in Mexico there. The scourge of fentanyl consumption [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=232.16s)]
*  is here in the United States. Anyway, take a look at these protests and what they visually looked [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=238.88s)]
*  like across the country. Just keying in on some cities here, but there were a lot of other cities. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=244.64s)]
*  I mean, there were literally thousands of towns and cities where protests like this were taking [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  place. But you can see this visual, Boston, New York, Chicago, Portland, San Francisco, San Diego, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=254.56s)]
*  Idaho, Utah, and Oakland, and so many more. What was so incredible about this is seeing the protests [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=259.12s)]
*  just in local small towns that were even like red-leaning towns. Seeing them in the villages [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=266.0s)]
*  in Florida, seeing them in right-leaning towns in Ohio and in Wisconsin and in Utah and in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=272.24s)]
*  Minnesota. Just across the country we saw some great ones. Thank you everybody for sharing those [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=280.32s)]
*  with us. I mean, just take a look at this image right here of the protest that took place in [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  downtown Chicago. Just take a look at what it looked like. Let's play it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=291.84s)]
*  I mean, look, we've made this the main story on the Midas Touch Network because it is the main [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=308.4s)]
*  story. But the way corporate news has... Don't get me wrong. I've seen corporate news cover it a [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=313.36s)]
*  little. Maybe they showed it. They've always downplayed it. You would think that in normal [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=319.68s)]
*  times you would be embedded with the protesters the way we were and showing the scale and scope. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=325.12s)]
*  This has never happened like this in American history before. And the corporate news like, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=330.08s)]
*  well, a few hundred people should... It was millions of people across the country when you add up all [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=335.44s)]
*  of the towns and cities rising up right now, rising up to crap like this. You have Scott Bessent going [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=340.32s)]
*  on Meet the Press this morning and Kristen Welker says, you said you were going to improve the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=347.44s)]
*  economy. What's your message, let's say, to people retiring right now who have now lost their life [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=352.08s)]
*  savings? To which Scott Bessent, who's worth half a billion dollars, who literally lived in a pink [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=358.32s)]
*  Barbie palace, that's what he called it. It was in Charleston, South Carolina. He goes, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=365.12s)]
*  I think Americans have it all in their savings. He says, I think they have it in their savings. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=369.44s)]
*  I wouldn't worry about that. I think they have it in their savings. Play this clip. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=374.8s)]
*  What is your message to Americans who want to retire right now and who've just seen their [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  lifetime savings drop significantly? Well, Kristen, I think that's a false [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=384.8s)]
*  narrative. Americans who want to retire right now, Americans who have put away for years in [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  their savings accounts, I think they don't look at the day-to-day fluctuations of what's happening. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=394.32s)]

*  deranged, these people. Trump's agriculture secretary, Brooke Collins, is asked by Jake [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=487.76s)]
*  Tapper on CNN, why are you imposing 10% tariffs on penguins? And she's like, oh gosh, he's so smart. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  He's so smart. Play this clip. President Trump laid out with a giant graphic of all the countries [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=502.0s)]
*  where tariffs were going to be, what he called reciprocal tariffs, were going to be [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=507.52s)]
*  imposed. And you're imposing a 10% tariff on the herd and McDonald Islands. The herd and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=510.79999999999995s)]
*  McDonald Islands have zero human inhabitants. They have zero exports. They have zero imports. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=516.48s)]
*  They do have a lot of penguins. Why are you putting import tariffs on islands that are [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=522.48s)]
*  entirely populated by penguins? Well, I mean, that, come on, Jake. Obviously, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  here's the bottom line. We live under a tariff regime from other countries. We have too long [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=537.76s)]
*  seeding the idea that America goes first. I mean, come on, whatever. Listen, the people that are [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  leading this are serious, intentional, patriotic, the smartest people I've ever worked with. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=552.48s)]
*  By the way, when we talk about pink dress lady from North Korea, now the propagandists, the main [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=558.64s)]
*  anger in North Korea, Donald Trump literally has pink dress ladies dressed in pink dresses. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=565.2s)]
*  Then you have Howard Lutnick asked about the destructive nature of these tariffs. And Mr. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=570.0s)]
*  ShamWow, Mr. Fashionist ShamWow goes, it's a shammy. It's why he goes, look. He goes, look, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=574.96s)]
*  Trump has been talking about this his whole life. I'm going to do big accordion hands. Look, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=581.2800000000001s)]
*  look here, everybody. Here, play this clip. ...term that other markets will look to other suppliers [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=586.32s)]
*  instead of dealing with the United States. That is ridiculous. The problem is everyone in the [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=591.52s)]
*  world sells to us. Our economy is the consumer of the world. We are the only one with a trade [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=598.4s)]
*  deficit. The rest of the world has a trade surplus. Why does Europe have a trade surplus? Is there [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=605.04s)]
*  something about Europe that's special? Seriously, are they a different world than we are? Why are [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=612.0s)]
*  they selling 200 billion a year more to us? It's because it's not fair. The rules are made not fair [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=618.16s)]
*  and President Trump is going to fix them and he's doing it for America and he's doing it for your [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  children and mine and our grandchildren. This is the moment that the United States of America takes [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  hold of itself. And Donald Trump's been talking about this his whole life. This is Donald Trump's [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=638.9599999999999s)]
*  agenda and we are all here to help him execute it. And we will. Again, these people are demented. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=644.88s)]
*  Here is Scott Besson, Donald Trump's Treasury Secretary. Lutnick's Commerce Secretary. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=650.64s)]
*  Here's Scott Besson saying, you know, I would tell everybody things are good. I would tell them [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=655.36s)]
*  things are good. What I saw on Friday in the market with the volume, with the trade volume, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=662.08s)]
*  is good. Here, play this clip. The markets lost more than six trillion dollars in value. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=668.56s)]
*  Was this disruption always part of the plan, Mr. Secretary? Look, the markets are organic, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=674.56s)]
*  the animals, and you never know what the reaction is going to be. One thing that I can tell you as [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=682.08s)]
*  the Treasury Secretary, what I've been very impressed with is the market infrastructure [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=687.76s)]
*  that we had record volume on Friday and everything is working very smoothly. So the American people, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=692.96s)]
*  they can be very, take great comfort in that. Oh, and then you have Kevin Hassett, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=700.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's top National Economic Council advisor. Here's what he has to say. Play this clip. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=708.72s)]
*  Why did the President not include Russia on the list of countries who are facing [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=714.48s)]
*  tariffs? There's obviously an ongoing negotiation with Russia and Ukraine, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=719.28s)]
*  and I think the President made the decision not to conflate the two issues. It doesn't mean that [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=725.12s)]
*  Russia, the fullest of time, is going to be treated wildly different than every other country. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=728.8s)]
*  But Russia is one of the only countries, one of the few countries that is not subject to these [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=733.12s)]
*  new tariffs, aren't they? They're in the middle of a negotiation, George, aren't they? And here he is [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=736.56s)]
*  again. Let's play it. The President retweeted a post that said the market drop was part of a deliberate [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=740.72s)]
*  strategy to force the Fed to lower interest rates. Is that the President's strategy? If not, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=744.96s)]
*  why did he post it? Yeah, that, you know, the bottom line is the President has been talking [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=750.8000000000001s)]
*  about tariffs for 40 years and this is like, Ben, absolutely the policy that he's focused on in the [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=755.52s)]
*  campaign and throughout his political career. Oh, then they bring on Pam Bondi, Donald Trump's [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=761.12s)]
*  attorney general, who continues this idea that we may have to look into a third term for Donald [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=765.84s)]
*  Trump. She's asked, so, you know, she goes, maybe he'll just listen to her and hear on words here. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=771.2s)]
*  Another headline, there's chatter about President Trump seeking a third term. He has said, quote, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=778.48s)]
*  there are methods. Is this just one of his epic trolls or does he or do you believe there is a [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=783.6s)]
*  method short of amending the Constitution by which he could seek a third term? President Trump has [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=790.08s)]
*  served one full term. He's on his second full term. He's a very smart man and we, I wish we could have [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=795.36s)]
*  him for 20 years as our president, but I think he's going to be finished probably after this term. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=801.92s)]
*  Probably. Well, the Constitution, we'd have to look at the Constitution. Finally, here is [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=806.96s)]
*  Democratic Senator Adam Schiff. Here's what he's got to say. Let's play. Unfortunately, he's wrecking [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=811.6800000000001s)]
*  our economy. I think people have seen their retirement savings on fire and there he is out [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=816.72s)]
*  on the golf course. That may end up being the most enduring image of the Trump presidency. That is, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=822.72s)]
*  the president out on a golf cart while people's retirement is in flames. The treasury secretary [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=828.1600000000001s)]
*  saying that people aren't looking at where the retirement savings are. Maybe he doesn't have to. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=834.72s)]
*  He's got the wealth. He doesn't have to. Maybe the president with his wealth doesn't have to, but [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=838.8000000000001s)]
*  what I'm hearing from Californians is those that have just retired, those are on the Eva retiring, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=843.52s)]
*  they're terrified of this. I hope and pray we stay out of recession, but if we head into a recession, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=849.2s)]
*  it will be the Trump recession. He will completely own it. This is a completely self-destructive [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=857.84s)]
*  economic act that he's engaged in. Yeah, that's exactly true. Anyway, that's what's happening [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBKUPsCqbo&t=864.32s)]
