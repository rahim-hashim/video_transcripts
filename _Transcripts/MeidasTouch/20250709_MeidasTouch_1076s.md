# FURIOUS Word Leaders RIP Trump TO SHREDS at PALACE
**MeidasTouch:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA)
*  Europeans will never abandon Ukraine, never. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=0.0s)]
*  World leaders are absolutely furious at Donald Trump and his regime. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=3.68s)]
*  That was French President Emmanuel Macron at the Palace of Westminster as part of his [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=11.64s)]
*  state visit to the United Kingdom. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=15.96s)]
*  He was speaking there in front of the British parliament, making a very strong defense of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=17.64s)]
*  Ukraine as the United States looks weaker and more isolated. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=22.52s)]
*  Just by way of example, what's now an average night for Ukraine cities. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=26.8s)]
*  It's midnight last night when this was posted by the Kyiv Insider. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=31.04s)]
*  And currently there was around 220 Russian, Iranian kamikaze drones bearing down on the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=34.8s)]
*  people of Ukraine, their homes, their apartment buildings and civilians. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=40.44s)]
*  And one of the things that Donald Trump did was withhold a massive amount of Patriot missile [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  Ukraine, only for Donald Trump to then claim that he didn't know that his own regime stopped [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=52.6s)]
*  sending those Patriot missiles to Ukraine. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=58.96s)]
*  And then they're blaming it on Pete Hegseth and said Hegseth was the one who did it without [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=61.44s)]
*  the consent or permission from the Trump regime. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=66.08s)]
*  It's absolute chaos in the Trump regime right now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  Let me tell you about more data points, how the United States has made the entire world [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=71.8s)]
*  furious. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  The entire world other than Vladimir Putin, Iran, Kim Jong-un and Xi Jinping of China, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  who are probably delighted to see the United States so, so weak. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=84.63999999999999s)]
*  So Donald Trump announced yesterday just randomly during this disastrous cabinet meeting that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  he will be imposing a 50 percent tariff on copper. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  And he reiterated he will be doing 200 percent tariffs on pharmaceuticals. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=97.96s)]
*  Canada is a major exporter of copper to the United States, exported about nine point three [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=103.16s)]
*  billion dollars worth of copper in 2023, with a majority of that 52 percent going to the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=110.16s)]
*  United States, China and Japan followed with 17 and 12 percent of Canadian exports respectively. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=118.2s)]
*  Now in Canada, they now see the United States as a massive threat, according to a Pew research [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=126.44s)]
*  study that was just released. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=133.72s)]
*  Fifty nine percent of Canadians view the United States as a major risk, according to the study. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=135.48s)]
*  I just want you to think about that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=142.64s)]
*  Fifty nine percent of Canadians view the United States as a major risk and now see the neighboring [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=144.72s)]
*  United States as the greatest threat to their country. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=151.24s)]
*  As this article from Politico says, Never mind Russia, North Korea and Iran, a majority of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=155.4s)]
*  Canadian citizens now see the neighboring United States as the greatest threat to their country. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=161.28s)]
*  Right. Let me bring you back to the Palace of Westminster for this incredible speech by [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=171.96s)]
*  It very much also reminds me of the speech that I previously showed you of Prime Minister [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  Mark Carney of Canada when he talked about the new defense pact between Canada and the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=180.08s)]
*  European Union, where you had Carney saying we are looking away from the United States [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=186.68s)]
*  towards Europe. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Here you have the UK, which in Brexit left the European Union, and you have French President [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=193.72000000000003s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron, obviously a leading force in the European Union. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  And you see that this is all about bridging the gaps right here as America becomes weaker [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=204.84s)]
*  and more isolated. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=210.56s)]
*  Watch this incredible portion of this speech from French President Emmanuel Macron as part [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  of his state visit at the Palace of Westminster. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=216.78s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=219.6s)]
*  It creates necessary conditions for robust and solid lasting peace. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=220.6s)]
*  I want to command your country. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=227.24s)]
*  And even before the first day, you were part of the closest ally of Ukraine, training the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  army, being here the first day to protect President Zelensky, his government, and allowing [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=238.76s)]
*  the forces just to resist, as you did decades ago with my country. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=246.88s)]
*  And together we worked very hard during the past few years in order to stand with the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=254.04s)]
*  Ukrainian people, just helping them to resist. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=259.8s)]
*  We were right and we are right. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=264.16s)]
*  And because every time Vladimir Putin's Russia advances in Ukraine, the threat moves closer [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=267.48s)]
*  to us all. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  We will never accept the theory that might is right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=273.56s)]
*  And I want to be clear. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=277.12s)]
*  This is why together with you, Mr. Prime Minister, we decided to launch last February this coalition [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  of the women you mentioned. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=286.08000000000004s)]
*  And this coalition was just a signal that Europeans will never abandon Ukraine. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=288.18s)]
*  Never. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=294.62s)]
*  And whatever the decisions could be elsewhere, we will fight till the very last minute in [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=295.62s)]
*  order to get the ceasefire, in order to start the negotiations to build this robust and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=323.22s)]
*  sustainable peace. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=330.18s)]
*  Because this is our security and our principles together, which are at stake in Ukraine. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=332.58000000000004s)]
*  This is a possibility of a European peace our generation did enjoy during the past decade, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=339.26000000000005s)]
*  which is at stake in Ukraine. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=346.90000000000003s)]
*  Now, speaking of Canada, I recently had former member of parliament and leader of the resistance [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=348.42s)]
*  Charlie Angus on my program. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=353.2s)]
*  He said, look, one of the things that I think is so important right now is going to be for [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=356.14s)]
*  Canada to start basically buying drones from Ukraine in order to protect its borders from [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=362.14s)]
*  the United States. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=372.65999999999997s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=374.09999999999997s)]
*  But this is a very, very sick and dark exhibition. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  So when we look at this as the people that we're negotiating with, Canadians need to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=379.06s)]
*  be really ready. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=383.64s)]
*  We are upping our investment in military spending significantly. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  We are now procuring from the Europeans, whereas before we would have just gone to the United [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=390.98s)]
*  States as per usual and buy gear. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=395.98s)]
*  We're not buying gear from the United States. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=398.02s)]
*  I don't know what the prime minister is thinking, but if I was him, I'd be inviting over Ukrainians [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=400.0s)]
*  to start setting up factories so that we can set up those hundred dollar drones because [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=405.1s)]
*  it's our border, it's our waterways, our lakes and our harbors that are now seriously under [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=408.82s)]
*  threat because we don't know where Trump is going to go. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=416.14000000000004s)]
*  I know in the media in Canada, they don't want to talk about that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=419.62s)]
*  They don't want to act like they're being hysterical. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=422.94s)]
*  But when you're seeing a president to the United States setting up concentration camps [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  and bragging about people being eaten by alligators, people whose only crime is they got picked [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=429.94s)]
*  up by ice, then the idea that we can trust them at our border is simply not on. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  We have to start getting ourselves ready for what could be the next part of the playbook. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=440.76s)]
*  So if you own a handgun for self-defense the way that I do, your storage likely fits into [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=447.44s)]
*  one of two frustrating categories. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=453.96000000000004s)]
*  It's either locked away safe, but out of reach in an emergency, or it's unsecured, leaving [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=455.96000000000004s)]
*  it vulnerable to anyone. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=461.76s)]
*  Not good. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=463.08000000000004s)]
*  But Stopbox USA, which is what I use, they saw the problem and they designed a groundbreaking [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=463.96s)]
*  solution, the Stopbox Pro. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=470.0s)]
*  So with the Stopbox Pro, you'll never have to choose between security and readiness again. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=472.2s)]

*  It's also battery free, so you never have to worry about your lock not working. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=505.96s)]
*  Traveling with peace of mind is easy because the Stopbox Pro is TSA compliant. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=511.16s)]

*  gun owner, you use a device like Stopbox. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=576.1999999999999s)]
*  Stopbox is what I use. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=579.12s)]
*  Thank you so much and check them out. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=580.12s)]
*  Now here is also another clip from Charlie Angus, former member of parliament and leader [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=581.8399999999999s)]
*  of the resistance. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=586.8199999999999s)]
*  He had a message to Donald Trump as well saying how Donald Trump was bringing Canadians together. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=593.4799999999999s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump, I'm going to say this once and I might never say it again. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=594.4799999999999s)]
*  I want to thank you. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=597.16s)]
*  I want to thank you for bringing Canada together. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=598.8s)]
*  It took such a malignant narcissistic slug like you to make us put aside all of our differences, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=601.68s)]
*  all our regional fights, all of our concerns with each other and realize that we actually [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=609.12s)]
*  had to stand up for something better, which is standing up for the rule of law, standing [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=613.7199999999999s)]
*  up for democracy, standing up for decency. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=617.5799999999999s)]
*  And we know that we're on your border and it freaks you out because you and your in-sale [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=620.9799999999999s)]
*  gang are so freaked out about diversity, equity, inclusion, your DEI nightmare. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=625.04s)]
*  Well, we are your DEI nightmare, Donald, because Canada is always going to be a country of [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  diversity. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=637.24s)]
*  We will always be a country of equity. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=638.24s)]
*  We will always be a country of inclusion and we will defend the rule of law. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=640.1999999999999s)]
*  And if you want to continue fighting with us, you are going to lose at the end of the [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=644.74s)]
*  day. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=648.36s)]
*  I'm not saying it's not going to hurt us, but we are true. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=649.36s)]
*  We are North. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=651.36s)]
*  We are strong. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=652.36s)]
*  We are free and we are ready for this fight, Donald. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  So make up your mind. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=655.84s)]
*  Quit fighting on social media with us. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=657.4s)]
*  Tell us what you're going to do because we're moving on and we're going to stand and hold [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=660.16s)]
*  the line. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=663.92s)]
*  Now, also over the past 24 to 48 hours, the foreign minister of Denmark, Foreign Minister [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=664.92s)]
*  Rasmussen was speaking and he's like, look, if the United States wants to talk about a [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=671.96s)]
*  joint defense, okay. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=677.6800000000001s)]
*  But if they want to talk about their sovereign taking over our sovereignty and conquering [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=680.16s)]
*  Greenland ain't going to happen. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=685.0s)]
*  Important to note that Denmark now is the leadership position in the European Union [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=687.16s)]
*  for this term. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=691.72s)]
*  Here's what the Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen had to say. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=693.52s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=699.0s)]
*  Well, we are still working to figure out what is actually the true American ambition. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=700.0s)]
*  I mean, we realize and I think we share the opinion that the security situation in Arctic [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=705.12s)]
*  has changed and we are ready to and by we, I mean the Kingdom of Denmark, the government [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=710.6s)]
*  in Greenland and Denmark are ready to cooperate with the American government to accommodate [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=716.08s)]
*  that. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=721.36s)]
*  So if it's about security, it's about access to raw materials, about closer business relations, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=722.36s)]
*  people to people contact, et cetera, we are ready to do our part. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=729.04s)]
*  If it's a ideological vision about, you know, enlarging the American territory, there's [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=734.4s)]
*  absolutely no way we can accommodate that, of course. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=739.84s)]
*  Another very powerful moment right here from French President Emmanuel Macron's speech. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=742.84s)]
*  Although we talked about cultural and artistic exchange between the UK and France, it had [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=748.48s)]
*  a very more profound meaning, in my opinion, because they talked about the arts, they talked [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=755.04s)]
*  about culture, they talked about supporting people, basically liberal democracy. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=761.8s)]
*  And to me, it was a message towards Donald Trump as well. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=767.6s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=770.24s)]
*  As the Channel Tunnel is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, let's make a wish here [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=771.24s)]
*  today. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=777.56s)]
*  Let's not allow the channel to grow wider. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=779.3199999999999s)]
*  Although there are 300,000 French people living in the United Kingdom and 150,000 British [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=782.36s)]
*  people living in France, there has been a decrease in movement in recent years when [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=791.2800000000001s)]
*  it comes to school, university, professional and research exchanges. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=796.64s)]
*  And today there is a risk that our societies are growing apart, that our young people do [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=801.96s)]
*  not know each other as well and may end up strangers at a time when international current [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=806.8000000000001s)]
*  events remind us on a daily basis of our common future. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=813.6s)]
*  Let's fix it. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=819.12s)]
*  Let's work together in order to facilitate the exchange of students, researchers, intellectuals, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=820.7199999999999s)]
*  artists. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=828.04s)]
*  This is so important. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=829.04s)]
*  Let's allow our children to have the same opportunities as the one we had. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=831.16s)]
*  Now here was a moment from Donald Trump's disastrous cabinet meeting yesterday when [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=836.76s)]
*  he was asked from Caitlin Collins of CNN, hey, question for you there, Donald. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=843.28s)]
*  So who signed off on stopping the shipments of weapons to Ukraine from the Defense Department? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=848.76s)]
*  Were you aware of this, Donald? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=855.4399999999999s)]
*  And he goes, I don't know. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=857.16s)]
*  You tell me. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=859.2s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=860.2s)]
*  So who ordered the pause last week? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=861.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=862.96s)]
*  What did you tell me? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=863.96s)]
*  I don't think that's a question. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=864.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=866.84s)]
*  You tell me. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=867.96s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=868.96s)]
*  And here Donald Trump is asked the question, you know, hey, Donald, I know you keep saying [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=871.06s)]
*  you're frustrated at Putin, but you said what back first off, you said you would bring peace [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=876.12s)]
*  to Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=882.4399999999999s)]
*  You said you would be able to get Putin to bring peace to Ukraine. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=884.1999999999999s)]
*  So obviously a lie there. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=888.36s)]
*  And then also what back in April, you said in two weeks you would impose sanctions on [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=890.68s)]
*  Putin, which you then lied about two more weeks, two more weeks, two more weeks. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=894.92s)]
*  And then you had a call with Putin last week where right after that call ended, Putin escalated [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=899.04s)]
*  his attacks and killings and genocide of innocent Ukrainians in Kiev. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=904.2800000000001s)]
*  So he's playing you. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=909.6800000000001s)]
*  He thinks you're a weak idiot, Donald. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=910.6800000000001s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=912.72s)]
*  The reporter didn't say weak idiot. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=914.0s)]
*  I said that. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=915.32s)]
*  But the reporter did say it seems like Putin's playing you. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=916.32s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump said. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=919.24s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=920.24s)]
*  He's we're dealing with him now, too. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=921.24s)]
*  We're not happy with him. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=924.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm not happy with him. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=925.8000000000001s)]
*  I can tell you that much right now because he's killing a lot of people and a lot of [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=927.2800000000001s)]
*  them are his soldiers. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=931.86s)]
*  His soldiers and their soldiers mostly. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=933.48s)]
*  And it's now up to seven thousand a week. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=936.48s)]
*  And I'm not happy with Putin. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=938.96s)]
*  OK, any questions? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=940.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=941.76s)]
*  Hi, sir. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=942.76s)]
*  You just said you're not happy with Putin. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=943.76s)]
*  Is there anything that you plan to do to act on that feeling of what happened? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=944.76s)]
*  I wouldn't be telling you. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=949.12s)]
*  Don't we want to have a little surprise? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=950.12s)]
*  You know, one of the things we did with the attack is that you asked that question. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=952.32s)]
*  I was I don't want to. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=958.04s)]
*  I didn't mean to be rude, but I'm going to root because I'm looking at some of these [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=959.04s)]
*  crooked people up here. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=962.0s)]
*  So I'm rude. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=963.78s)]
*  But your question was asked very nicely. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=964.78s)]
*  But one of the things we did is we we went over every fact. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=967.2s)]
*  We want to get every fact straight. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=971.76s)]
*  We want to have the distance straight, the number of pilots straight. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=973.88s)]
*  Everything had to be correct because we want to be. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=977.0s)]
*  This was a very important mission. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=979.72s)]
*  If we failed on this mission, it was beyond the war that, you know, obviously we had with [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=982.28s)]
*  Iran and Israel a lot of hatred, a lot of years and years of hatred, centuries of hatred. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=989.66s)]
*  People have never seen anything like it. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=998.02s)]
*  So we wanted to be correct with all of our facts. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=999.92s)]
*  So you know what I was doing is just asking, it would be great if if the media would be [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=1002.14s)]
*  correct with their facts. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=1008.2199999999999s)]
*  That's all we ask for. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=1009.2199999999999s)]
*  So all of this is taking place. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=1010.2199999999999s)]
*  One of the things that we learned as well is that one of Donald Trump's top advisors [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=1012.56s)]
*  was actually born in the Soviet Union. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9ygTdv1tA&t=1018.38s)]
