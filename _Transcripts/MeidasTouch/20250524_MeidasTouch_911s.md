# DAMNING Video RESURFACES Predicting TRUMP DEMISE
**MeidasTouch:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw)
*  Donald Trump is brutally screwing over his own voters. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=0.0s)]
*  Those in the red states are going to be hit the hardest [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=3.5s)]
*  based on Donald Trump's schemes and scams. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=6.3s)]
*  Don't trust me. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=8.74s)]
*  How about 2017 JD Vance play the clip? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=9.84s)]
*  And as we've been talking about, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=14.08s)]
*  this is not just a policy problem. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=15.92s)]
*  There's obviously a significant issue [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=17.62s)]
*  of folks potentially losing access to their healthcare. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=19.36s)]
*  But if you think of the political problem, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=21.96s)]
*  folks have always asked, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=23.76s)]
*  what is it that's going to drive Donald Trump's voters [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=25.26s)]
*  away from him? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=27.62s)]
*  Well, losing their healthcare may actually be the answer [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=28.8s)]
*  to that question. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=31.3s)]
*  And unfortunately, the Republicans, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=32.44s)]
*  who I think have been very smart and frankly correct [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=34.1s)]
*  in the fact that Obamacare hasn't solved [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=37.04s)]
*  a lot of the core problems [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=39.3s)]
*  of the American healthcare market, now own the problem. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=40.58s)]
*  They're going to learn very quickly, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=43.52s)]
*  unless they craft a better bill, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=45.28s)]
*  that it's not just enough to critique the bill [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=47.22s)]
*  that has failed in the past. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=49.38s)]
*  You have to actually offer a better alternative. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=50.86s)]
*  And we're going to see if the Senate is able [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=53.019999999999996s)]
*  to actually put forward that alternative. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=54.86s)]
*  Democrats have also been. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=56.580000000000005s)]
*  We all know under the new GOP budget scam, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=58.46s)]
*  13, 14 million Americans are going to lose their healthcare. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  They're going to lose access to supplemental nutrition, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=64.8s)]
*  assistance program, food stamps. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=67.66s)]
*  They're going to lose access to programs [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=69.84s)]
*  that provide cost of living and rental assistance. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=72.04s)]
*  But there's no longer regulation on silencers [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=77.04s)]
*  and silencers get tax exemptions. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=80.54s)]
*  So I guess silencers were a big winner also, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=82.38s)]
*  of course, billionaires and oligarchs were a big winner, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=85.24s)]
*  getting trillions of dollars in tax cuts [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=87.82s)]
*  from stealing from the poor. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=89.78s)]
*  Then you've got these like Trump officials like Jeanine Pirro, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=92.78s)]
*  making these like selfie videos of herself, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=96.16s)]
*  like Jeanine Pirro, that yes, the Fox host [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=98.56s)]
*  is now the top federal prosecutor in Washington, DC. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=100.9s)]
*  And she's like making selfie videos, whining over water [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  and that she has to pay $7 for, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=109.25999999999999s)]
*  I don't even know what she's whining about, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=111.24s)]
*  but let them eat cake, huh? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=112.78s)]
*  Let's see here, play this clip. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=114.88s)]
*  Hi, everyone, it's Judge Jeanine. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=116.86s)]
*  I'm at the water cooler in the United States Attorney's Office [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=118.66s)]
*  in Washington, DC. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  And you may recall that the United States [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=123.06s)]
*  gave something like $44 billion a year through USAID [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  for things like dance classes in Wuhan, China [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=130.35999999999999s)]
*  and Sesame Street in Iraq. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=133.7s)]
*  But here in the United States, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=135.88s)]
*  in the United States Attorney's Office [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=137.44s)]
*  where we prosecute crime on behalf of the victims, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=139.32s)]
*  on behalf of the people who are targeted [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=142.42s)]
*  by criminals, the US attorneys, as well as the staff, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=144.8s)]
*  in order to get water, they have to join a water club [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=148.44s)]
*  and they have to pay, it's a dues paying membership. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=151.68s)]
*  And today they asked for our patience, why? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=155.16s)]
*  Because we couldn't get water delivered today. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=158.26s)]
*  Today there was no water delivered to the United States. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=161.68s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=165.68s)]
*  I mean, you just can't make this stuff up. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=167.64s)]
*  And also Donald Trump last Thursday [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=169.96s)]
*  had his meeting with his meme coin wallet holders. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=173.76s)]
*  Most of them are from foreign countries. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  And here Donald Trump's press secretary, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  chief propagandist says, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=184.66s)]
*  you're not gonna get to know who was there [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=186.44s)]
*  because this is his personal time. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=188.44s)]
*  He's on personal time. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=190.32s)]
*  So we don't know the people who have paid millions of dollars [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=192.28s)]
*  to buy access here at Play This Club. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=198.0s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=198.84s)]
*  Garrett, go ahead. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=199.66s)]
*  You guys are very proud of your record on transparency. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=200.5s)]
*  I have two transparency related questions for you. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=203.12s)]
*  On the president's dinner tonight, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=205.76s)]
*  will the White House commit to making a list [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=207.72s)]
*  of the attendees public so people can see [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=209.6s)]
*  who's paying for that kind of access to the president? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, as you know, Garrett, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=214.64s)]
*  this question has been raised with the president. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=215.76s)]
*  I have also addressed the dinner tonight. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=218.2s)]
*  The president is attending it in his personal time. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=219.92s)]
*  It is not a White House dinner. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  It's not taking place here at the White House, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=224.92s)]
*  but certainly I can raise that question [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=226.92s)]
*  and try to get you an answer for it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=229.04s)]
*  Okay, and on the Qatari aircraft, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=230.2s)]
*  the Air Force has said they're gonna classify. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  Let's bring in Molly Jungfest, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=235.28s)]
*  friend of the Midas Touch Network, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=237.52s)]
*  and Molly actually gave the introduction [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=239.18s)]
*  to the Webby Award that we won. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=242.44s)]
*  It was a beautiful introduction. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=244.52s)]
*  Thank you, Molly. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=245.8s)]
*  Molly, you've been a writer. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=246.62s)]
*  You've been covering different administrations. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=248.08s)]
*  What I just showed you, let them eat cake, huh? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=252.36s)]
*  Let them eat cake. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=254.72s)]
*  You know what's so interesting about this administration [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=256.44s)]
*  at every point, they're sort of rediscovering government. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=259.68s)]
*  Like they're learning how government works. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=262.84s)]
*  You know, Judge Pirro, Judge Jeanine, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=265.48s)]
*  Judge Box of Wine, as she's called, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=268.52s)]
*  she has this, you know, here she is, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=272.0s)]
*  learning about government. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=275.88s)]
*  It's not fancy, right? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=277.0s)]
*  There is money that's spent for foreign aid. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=279.08s)]
*  I mean, I thought that was bizarre, very specious, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=281.68s)]
*  that somehow millions of dollars of foreign aid [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=285.72s)]
*  should be sort of spent on government workers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=288.92s)]
*  And the funny thing that government workers' offices, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=291.88000000000005s)]
*  what I think is the funniest part of this whole thing [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=296.20000000000005s)]
*  is that these people actually, they do in fact, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=298.36s)]
*  like they made this whole case to their people [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=304.70000000000005s)]
*  that somehow government workers were making all this money [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=306.88000000000005s)]
*  and government was filled with fraud, waste, and abuse. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=310.20000000000005s)]
*  And here is Judge Pirro going like, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  oh, actually there's not even bottled water here. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=316.12s)]
*  So it turns out the federal government is not as fancy [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=318.8s)]
*  as a Fox News green room. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=322.32s)]
*  You talk about the people who are gonna be hit the hardest [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  from this budget bill, or frankly, everything that Trump does, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=328.56s)]
*  you know, the people who feel, we all are feeling pain, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=334.16s)]
*  but it's often people, even in the red states though, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=337.6s)]
*  who are dependent on Medicaid, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=340.8s)]
*  who are dependent on food stamps, who are dependent, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=343.12s)]
*  not to say it's just unique to that, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=346.56s)]
*  but if you look at it, yet the propaganda, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=348.68s)]
*  whether it's the racism, the propaganda, the hate, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=353.4s)]
*  the lies seem to still kind of permeate. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=357.08s)]
*  Don't get me wrong, we're seeing polls right now [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=359.8s)]
*  showing that Donald Trump's the least popular [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=362.56s)]
*  at this point in presidential history, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=364.76s)]
*  but still his support, depending on poll to poll, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=367.12s)]
*  is 37% to 42%. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=369.52s)]
*  That's still a lot of millions of people [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=372.44s)]
*  who are suffering a vote for this guy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=374.0s)]
*  Well, with the structure, it's a question of the structure. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=376.12s)]
*  So a lot of these blue states have high state taxes. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  When you have a high state tax, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=382.56s)]
*  it means you get more money from the state. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=384.23999999999995s)]
*  If you have a lower state tax, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=386.28s)]
*  you have to get more money from the federal government. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=387.4s)]
*  And those red states are the states [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=389.79999999999995s)]
*  with the lower state taxes. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=391.79999999999995s)]
*  So they get more money from the federal government. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=393.32s)]
*  What does Donald Trump wanna do? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=395.52s)]
*  What does the big, beautiful bill do? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=396.91999999999996s)]
*  It actually cuts federal services for a lot of states, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, cuts federal services broadly across the board, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=404.04s)]
*  but the people are gonna be affected, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=406.52s)]
*  the harshest are gonna be people who live in red states. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=408.2s)]
*  For example, Trump World is obsessed [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=411.0s)]
*  with getting rid of the Department of Education. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=413.52s)]
*  They're doing this because they're sort of obsessed [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=415.12s)]
*  with Carter and Carter created the Department of Education. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=418.64s)]
*  So there's a feeling that if they could just get rid [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=422.28000000000003s)]
*  of the Department of Education, then they can, you know. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=424.48s)]
*  But the things that the Department of Education [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=427.24s)]
*  does not do, right, Pell Grants, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  that's college for kids who can't afford it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=432.44s)]
*  Title I, that's money for schools [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  that don't have any money. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=437.52000000000004s)]
*  These are things that are really helped the poorest of us [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=438.76000000000005s)]
*  and why the federal government sort of exists there, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=443.24s)]
*  the social safety net. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=447.32000000000005s)]
*  And what Trump did in his second term [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=448.8s)]
*  was he was able to get sort of lower information voters [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=451.76000000000005s)]
*  to get out and vote for him. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=455.72s)]
*  And they were, you know, people who didn't necessarily vote. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=457.08s)]
*  They're not even lower information. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  That is true, but they're also these low frequency voters. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  That's why the polling is always so off for Trump [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=465.76s)]
*  is because he gets people who don't vote to vote for him. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=468.32s)]
*  But the problem is a lot of those people who don't vote [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=471.91999999999996s)]
*  tend to be people who really are, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=474.24s)]
*  who benefit from the federal government [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=476.64s)]
*  as well they should, a lot of them. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  One of the most disturbing things [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=480.96s)]
*  about this big, beautiful bill, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=482.88s)]
*  and look, this bill is gonna go to the Senate, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=484.03999999999996s)]
*  it's gonna get totally changed. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=487.12s)]
*  But one of the things that's the most upsetting about it, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=488.20000000000005s)]
*  this really is this bill is set up to make good [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=491.12s)]
*  a lot of Trump's campaign promises, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=494.28000000000003s)]
*  many of which are, I think, pretty undoable, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=496.24s)]
*  like no tax on tips. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=498.84000000000003s)]
*  How are you gonna say what's a tip, what's not a tip? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=500.64000000000004s)]
*  How are you gonna, you know, make it so that people [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=503.04s)]
*  can't just say everything I do is a tip now? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's, I'm not sure how you can structure that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=509.32000000000005s)]
*  But more importantly, what you're seeing now [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=512.44s)]
*  is these, it's just these Republicans [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=516.12s)]
*  are going after the people who put them in office. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=520.08s)]
*  And a great example of this is the SNAP benefit. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  So this will be the largest cut to food assistance, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=525.64s)]
*  you know, in, I think in history, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=532.0s)]
*  I think that I had read it was in history. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=534.72s)]
*  And I mean, it'll be a seismic shift [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=536.96s)]
*  in the way we give money to children. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=539.88s)]
*  It will mean more healthy, more hungry children. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=542.96s)]
*  This cut will mean more hungry children. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=546.32s)]
*  Important to mention that this bill also grows the deficit. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=548.6s)]
*  So it both cuts services for poor children, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=553.0400000000001s)]
*  more hungry children, and also more government debt. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't know how it manages to both do two of the things [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=561.12s)]
*  you don't want in your, you know, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=565.0s)]
*  starve children and also grow the deficit, but it does. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=567.44s)]
*  And look, by the way, the bond market isn't happy. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=571.64s)]
*  You know, the bond market is sort of the last thing [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=573.8000000000001s)]
*  we have putting Trump in check. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=576.44s)]
*  And it's foreign investors saying like, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=578.72s)]
*  is the US credit good or bad? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=580.6800000000001s)]
*  Do we even really wanna be in this thing? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=582.44s)]
*  And the bond market is freaked out by this [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=584.96s)]
*  as well it should be, because this is a budget of sort of, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=586.6800000000001s)]
*  it's just a very, you know, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=591.2s)]
*  it shows a certain lack of responsibility [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=593.76s)]
*  that the Republican party doesn't, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=597.28s)]
*  they are not worried about the deficit [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=599.0s)]
*  and they're also not worried about serving children, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=600.72s)]
*  which these are two things they should be worried about. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=602.5600000000001s)]
*  A lack of responsibility is Trump being Trumpy, right? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=606.12s)]
*  You go back and just look at everything [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=609.28s)]
*  this guy's done in his life. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=610.9200000000001s)]
*  When he went into Atlantic City with daddy's money, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=612.64s)]
*  three casinos he bought right next to each other [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=615.64s)]
*  and everybody's saying the amount of debt you're taking on [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=618.48s)]
*  with three of your own casinos [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=622.52s)]
*  that are gonna compete against each other, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=624.36s)]
*  you're gonna cannibalize your own casinos. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=626.48s)]
*  So you may have this flashy opening with Michael Jackson [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=629.0s)]
*  and fake gold plated this, you're gonna bankrupt it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=632.72s)]
*  What does Trump do? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=635.52s)]
*  Threatens the whistleblowers, they get fired, they sue him. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=636.64s)]
*  He settled at least with one big prominent case. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=639.96s)]
*  The Atlantic City casinos go bankrupt over and over again. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=642.96s)]
*  He makes money, but the contractors there [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=646.68s)]
*  and the workers lost their life savings [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=649.48s)]
*  and Atlantic City was destroyed. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=652.28s)]
*  And we see this with a lot of his endeavors [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=654.4s)]
*  and now he's doing this with the United States of America. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=656.84s)]
*  Now, one of the things that I've talked about [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=660.2s)]
*  to combat all of this is I try to say, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=662.1600000000001s)]
*  let's not get too political and let's focus on the people. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=665.44s)]
*  I said, politics has a way of gamifying humanity and people [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=668.64s)]
*  and sometimes you just have to listen [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=673.24s)]
*  and hear the life stories [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=674.72s)]
*  of just what people are going through. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=676.48s)]
*  And every dot comma period red line of a budget bill [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=678.96s)]
*  is actually impacting families [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=684.96s)]
*  and all families have stories to tell, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=686.88s)]
*  which is why I find it interesting also [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=689.24s)]
*  that your latest book is a personal memoir. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=690.88s)]
*  It's a daughter's memoir where you at this moment [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=693.5600000000001s)]
*  wanna tell a story about just your own family. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=696.2s)]
*  You call it, How to Lose Your Mother, a daughter's memoir. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=699.32s)]
*  It's a great book and I just think that [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=702.88s)]
*  what's important about this is that [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=705.64s)]
*  we have to always reflect on, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=708.0400000000001s)]
*  we all have unique and interesting family details [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=710.36s)]
*  and family dynamics with complexities and drama and love [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=714.48s)]
*  and all of these issues and not to use a cliche, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=719.48s)]
*  but nothing gold can stay. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=725.0s)]
*  We're all here for a fleeting moment of time [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=726.28s)]
*  with our families and we just want what's best for them [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=729.24s)]
*  as we struggle through complex worlds. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=732.12s)]
*  So I wonder if you wrote this book also now [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=734.24s)]
*  because of kind of the uncertainty. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=737.56s)]
*  I guess I should just ask you, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=741.24s)]
*  rather than telling my hypothesis for why you write it, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=742.52s)]
*  why now for a book like this? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=745.56s)]
*  So my generation is, and I think it may also [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=748.36s)]
*  be your generation, we're generation X, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=752.84s)]
*  we're young generation X. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=755.24s)]
*  So like at the very tail end of the generation, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=756.76s)]
*  but we are a generation that has, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=759.88s)]
*  we are the least written about, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=764.28s)]
*  the least, people aren't really interested in us, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=765.92s)]
*  but we are this generation that really does, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=769.6s)]
*  it really does just sort of, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=775.6s)]
*  we have this moment where we have children and parents, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=778.0s)]
*  we're taking care of children and parents. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=781.24s)]
*  And I wanted to write about this experience [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  of being in this sandwich generation and having, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=785.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna, yeah, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=790.64s)]
*  and having to care, here it is, it's very beautiful, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=793.72s)]
*  having to care for your parents and also your children. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=797.92s)]
*  And I was glad that I got to write it. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=803.96s)]
*  And I also wanted to talk about sort of what it's like [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=807.72s)]
*  to have a spouse who has cancer, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=812.32s)]
*  my husband had cancer, though he is fine, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=814.04s)]
*  but I got to write about that. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=816.84s)]
*  And that was really clarifying. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=818.84s)]
*  And it's funny because now, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=822.04s)]
*  Joe Biden just had this terrible metastatic cancer diagnosis. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=824.04s)]
*  And I write, almost a third, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=831.04s)]
*  actually even more than a third of Americans [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=834.52s)]
*  will get diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=837.9599999999999s)]
*  That's a humongous group. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=840.36s)]
*  And so I write a lot about how to be able, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=842.16s)]
*  it's not a political book, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=848.0799999999999s)]
*  but in the fact that science is political [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=849.1999999999999s)]
*  and these things are all political, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=852.4799999999999s)]
*  but it's really about this kind of how to talk [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=854.16s)]
*  to the people around you and take care of them. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULKlXNh2iw&t=859.28s)]
