# Supreme Court TORCHES Trump in MAJOR ORAL ARGUMENT
**MeidasTouch:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E)
*  It certainly did not seem like a majority of the United States Supreme Court was buying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=0.0s)]
*  what Donald Trump and the regime were selling on the issue of birthright citizenship. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=6.0s)]
*  A major oral argument was held today before the United States Supreme Court, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=12.16s)]
*  where the Trump regime was challenging the right of federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=18.0s)]
*  and specifically in the context of nationwide injunctions blocking the regime via executive [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=25.92s)]
*  order to eliminate the constitutional right to birthright citizenship. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=34.32s)]
*  Yep, Donald Trump believes that he could execute an executive order overruling the Constitution [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=39.68s)]
*  and that federal courts can issue nationwide injunctions to block him. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=45.52s)]
*  This case before the Supreme Court was more surgically dealing with the issue of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=51.36s)]
*  nationwide injunctions, but some of the issues between injunctions, meaning a single court [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=57.12s)]
*  being able to block an administration or regime's ability to institute something on a nationwide [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=64.16s)]
*  basis, that was what was mostly addressed. But because it does relate to the merits as well [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=71.52s)]
*  in birthright citizenship, you heard a little bit of the merits argument made there. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=77.84s)]
*  The case was consolidated of multiple cases, Trump versus New Jersey, Trump versus Washington, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=82.16s)]
*  and Trump versus Casa Inc., the Solicitor General for New Jersey. The top law enforcement attorney [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=89.84s)]
*  general, rather, in New Jersey was the person who argued this case for all of the states. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=97.36s)]
*  And for Trump, you had his Solicitor General of the United States, John Sauer, who was previously [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=103.12s)]
*  Donald Trump's personal attorney. So let me go through some of the highlights of what went down. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=110.08s)]
*  Then let's talk more comprehensively about what took place today. Here is Justice Kagan, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=116.64s)]
*  a liberal justice. Here's what she had to say. Play this clip. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=123.44s)]
*  One can expect that there is not going to be a great deal of disagreement among the lower courts. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=133.12s)]
*  I mean, let's assume that you lose in the lower courts pretty uniformly as you have been losing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=138.8s)]
*  on this issue, and that you never take this question to us. I mean, I noticed that you [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=144.72s)]
*  didn't take the substantive question to us. You only took the nationwide injunction question to us. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=150.4s)]
*  I mean, why would you take the substantive question to us? You're losing a bunch of cases, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  this guy over here, this woman over here, you know, they'll have to be treated as citizens, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=163.44s)]
*  but nobody else will. Why would you ever take this case to us? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=168.4s)]
*  Well, in this particular case, we have deliberately not presented the merits to this court on the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=171.92s)]
*  question of the scope of remedies, because of course, that makes it a clean vehicle where [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=177.04s)]
*  the court doesn't have to look at the past. You're ignoring the import of my question. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=182.0s)]
*  I'm suggesting that in a case in which the government is losing constantly, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=185.92s)]
*  there's nobody else who's going to appeal. They're winning. It's up to you to decide whether to take [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=192.48s)]
*  this case to us. If I were in your shoes, there is no way I'd approach the Supreme Court with this [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=198.8s)]
*  case. So you just keep on losing in the lower courts. And what's supposed to happen to prevent [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=204.4s)]
*  that? Again, I respectfully disagree with that forecast of the merits. But in response to the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=210.16s)]
*  question, what I would say is, we have an adversarial system. And if the government is not, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=214.56s)]
*  for example, not respecting circuit precedent on the court's hypothetical in the Second Circuit, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=219.04s)]
*  someone injured in the Second Circuit could take the case up and they could say, look, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=222.88s)]
*  the government is violating circuit precedent on the hypothetical multiple circuits. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=226.0s)]
*  That's the case we're going to take somebody who says, who says, you know, after we've said that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=230.64s)]
*  this all has to be done one by one by one, then we're going to take a case from somebody who [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=238.32s)]
*  objects to proceeding one by one by one. Now, I think this is notable here. You had [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=244.56s)]
*  Justice Barrett, Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, seeming to side with Justice Kagan [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=252.72s)]
*  here and really asking the Trump regime. So you think you're not bound to follow circuit court [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=260.8s)]
*  decisions? You're not going to follow it. You just think generally, wow, that surprises me. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=268.32s)]
*  Play this clip. Opinions and judgments here. Did I understand you correctly to tell Justice Kagan [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=273.68s)]
*  that the government wanted to reserve its right to maybe not follow a Second Circuit precedent, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=279.2s)]
*  say, in New York, because you might disagree with the opinion? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=285.12s)]
*  Our general practice is to respect those precedents. But there are circumstances when [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=288.88s)]
*  it is not a categorical practice. And that is not this administration's practice or the long [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=294.48s)]
*  standing practice of the federal government. And I'm not talking about in the Fourth Circuit. Are [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=299.04s)]
*  you going to respect a Second Circuit? I'm talking about within the Second Circuit. And can you say, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=302.72s)]
*  is that this administration's practice or a long standing one? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=307.36s)]
*  As I understand it, long standing policy of the Department of Justice. Yes, that we generally, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  as it was phrased to me, generally respect circuit president, but not necessarily in every case. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=314.96s)]
*  And certain examples, some examples might be a situation where we're litigating to try and get [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=319.84s)]
*  that circuit president overruled and so forth. Well, OK, so I'm not talking about a situation [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=324.0s)]
*  in which, you know, the Second Circuit has a case from 1955 and you think it's time for it to be [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=329.12s)]
*  challenged. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about in this kind of situation. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=334.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm talking about this week, the Second Circuit holds that the executive order is unconstitutional. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=338.08s)]
*  And then what do you do the next day or the next week? Generally, we follow. So you're still [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=343.2s)]
*  saying generally. Yes. And you still think that it's generally the policy, long standing policy [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=347.44s)]
*  of the federal government to take that approach. That is my understanding. OK, so but it sounds to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=352.24s)]
*  me like you accept a Cooper versus Aaron kind of situation for the Supreme Court, but not for, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=356.56s)]
*  say, the Second Circuit. Where you would respect the opinions and the judgments of the Supreme Court. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=362.16s)]
*  And you're saying you would respect the judgment, but not necessarily the opinion of a lower court. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=368.72s)]
*  And again, and I think in the vast majority of instances, our practice has been to respect the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=373.04s)]
*  opinion as well in the circuits as well. But my understanding is that has not been a categorical [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=376.24s)]
*  practice in the way respect for the precedents and the judgments of the Supreme Court has been. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=380.72s)]
*  So you're not hedging it all with respect to the precedent of this court? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  That is correct. I believe the quotation from our application directly addresses that. And we stand [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=388.64000000000004s)]
*  by that completely. OK. And here is a moment at the Supreme Court where Trump Solicitor General [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=393.68s)]
*  John Sauer admits to Justice Kavanaugh, another Trump appointee, that Trump has no idea how to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=399.76s)]
*  actually enforce his birthright citizenship. Author Max Burns was there reporting. Play this clip. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  On the day after it goes into effect, it's just a very practical question how it's going to work. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=412.8s)]
*  What do hospitals do with a newborn? What do states do with a newborn? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=419.76s)]
*  I don't think they do anything different. What the executive order says in Section 2 is that [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=426.48s)]
*  federal officials do not accept documents that have the wrong designation of citizenship from [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=430.48s)]
*  people who are subject to the executive order. How are they going to know that? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  The states can continue to, the federal officials will have to figure that out. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=438.16s)]
*  How? So you can imagine a number of ways that the federal officials could. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  Such as? Such as they could require a showing of, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=447.76s)]
*  you know, documentation showing legal presence in the country. For a temporary visitor, for example, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=451.12s)]
*  they could see whether they're on a B1 visa, which would exclude kind of the birthright citizenship [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=456.08s)]
*  and that kind of. For all the newborns? Is that how it's going to work? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=460.47999999999996s)]
*  Again, we don't know. When was the last time that you truly [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=464.4s)]
*  trusted seafood you brought home? Now, I used to question everything from nutrition and taste to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=467.44s)]
*  sustainability until I discovered the Wild Alaskan Company. Wild Alaskan Company is the best way to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=472.24s)]
*  get wild caught, perfectly portioned, nutrient dense seafood delivered directly to your door. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=478.32s)]
*  Trust me, you haven't tasted fish this good. I was so excited the first time I received my shipment [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=483.28s)]
*  from the Wild Alaskan Company. I received my Pacific halibut and pan seared it that evening. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  It was delicious. The Wild Alaskan Company is 100% wild caught, never farmed. This means there are [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=494.0s)]
*  no antibiotics, GMOs or additives, just clean, real fish that support healthy oceans and fishing [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=500.88s)]
*  communities. It's nutrient rich and full of flavor. Wild Alaskan fish is frozen off the boat [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=507.04s)]
*  to lock in taste, texture and nutrients like omega-3s. My favorite, it's also sustainably [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=512.88s)]
*  sourced. Wild caught from Alaska, every order supports sustainable harvesting practices [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=518.48s)]

*  Thanks to Wild Alaskan Company for sponsoring this episode. Right now, let's take a look at [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=556.4000000000001s)]
*  what went down inside this hearing as well. We'll give you some of the details directly from [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=561.2s)]
*  Mitis Touch, Mitis Plus right here. Supreme Court torches Trump administration during birthright [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=567.68s)]
*  citizenship argument. In a pivotal moment of Trump's second term, the United States Supreme [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=574.8s)]
*  Court has turned skeptical and at times a blistering eye towards the regime stance on nationwide [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=579.04s)]
*  injunctions. While the central question of the case doesn't address the constitutionality of [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=585.2s)]
*  modifying the 14th Amendment, a long shot goal of Trump, the real issue at stake is just as [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=589.52s)]
*  critical. Can federal judges block executive actions on a national scale? This seemingly [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=595.28s)]
*  procedural question could have massive consequences. If the Trump administration gets its way, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=600.56s)]
*  lower federal courts would no longer be able to issue rulings that halt policies nationwide. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=606.0799999999999s)]
*  Instead, any injunction would only apply to plaintiffs directly involved in a given case. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=611.76s)]
*  As you heard from some of the portions of the oral argument that I played, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=617.6s)]
*  as Justice Kagan says, y'all keep on losing over and over again. What the Trump regime wants to do [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=622.5600000000001s)]
*  is because it knows its cases are losers. If you can enforce a nationwide injunction and it only [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=630.8000000000001s)]
*  applies to the plaintiffs, they can push forward their authoritarian policies until the case goes [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=637.2s)]
*  to the United States Supreme Court. During oral arguments, the justices across ideological lines [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=642.64s)]
*  showed deep reservations about such sweeping restrictions on judicial power. Justice Sonia [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=649.6s)]
*  Sotomayor cut to the heart of the issue with a dramatic hypothetical. If the government were to [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  suddenly order the confiscation of all civilian firearms in direct violation of the Second [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=660.24s)]
*  Amendment under the Trump view, courts couldn't stop it with a nationwide injunction. We couldn't [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=666.16s)]
*  stop that, she asked. Justice Kagan was even more blunt. The government keeps on losing. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=671.52s)]
*  This is happening right now. Every court has ruled against you. That's the clip I played. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=676.56s)]
*  That comment wasn't just rhetorical flourish. It pointed to a pattern of losses the regime has [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=681.36s)]
*  racked up in the lower courts, particularly when rolling out controversial immigration policy. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=687.1999999999999s)]
*  If courts are stripped of the ability to issue broad injunctions, critics argue, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=693.12s)]
*  the executive branch could continue implementing unlawful policies unchecked, avoiding scrutiny of [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=697.44s)]
*  the Supreme Court altogether until the case goes before the Supreme Court. And is that just going [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=703.28s)]
*  to result in more shadow docket decisions of people trying to rush to the Supreme Court or the Trump [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=708.88s)]
*  regime trying to gain the system? Justice Katanji Brown Jackson was especially pointed. She compared [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=714.96s)]
*  the administration's proposal to a catch me if you can approach to governance, one that would allow [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=720.64s)]
*  illegal policies to remain in effect until a perfect plaintiff and a perfect jurisdiction [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=725.76s)]
*  brings a challenge that finally makes its way to the top. Justice Amy Coney Barrett and Justice [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=731.2s)]
*  Neil Gorsuch also appeared critical of the regime's arguments. Barrett echoed Alito's earlier [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=737.2s)]
*  skepticism. What's the point of this? And Gorsuch notably praised Kagan's line of questioning, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=742.64s)]
*  often a signal of alignment during oral arguments. Meanwhile, New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=748.0s)]
*  Feigenbaum argued for a middle ground. Yes, judges should be able to issue nationwide injunctions, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=754.08s)]
*  but only under narrow and specific conditions. That prompted a key question from Chief Justice [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=759.44s)]
*  John Roberts, who seemed to be probing whether a narrow principle limitation could guide the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  court's ruling without fully endorsing the regime's extreme position. The significance of this case [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=770.72s)]
*  cannot be overstated, though frame as a procedural matter, the ability of courts to issue nationwide [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=776.0s)]
*  injunctions has become one of the most potent checks on presidential power in the modern era. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=781.76s)]
*  Strip it away and you open the door to a more aggressive, less accountable executive. As of [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=788.24s)]
*  now, it appears likely that there were at least five votes against the Trump regime position. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=794.4s)]
*  Gorsuch, Jackson, Barrett, Sotomayor, and Kagan. More may join. Chief Justice Roberts remains a [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=798.88s)]
*  wild card, but his pointed questioning suggests he is weighing a compromise approach rather than a [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=804.3199999999999s)]
*  full endorsement of the regime's request. Now, anything is possible is here, so we have to wait [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=810.0s)]
*  until the Supreme Court decides. So when will we know the outcome? The court typically hands down [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=814.96s)]
*  decisions in argued cases by the end of June, and there's no reason to believe this case will be an [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=819.52s)]
*  exception. Depending on how sharply the court wants to signal its stance, we may even see a decision [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=824.96s)]
*  sooner. What's clear, however, is this. The Trump regime walked into the Supreme Court hoping to [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=830.0s)]
*  disarm one of the judiciary's most powerful tools. Instead, it may walk out with a historic [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=835.36s)]
*  rebuke and a precedent that affirms the court's ability to check presidential overreach for years [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=841.04s)]
*  to come. Stay tuned, folks. This one matters. I'm Ben Micellus. This is the Midas Touch Network. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AyU8Jr66E&t=846.8000000000001s)]
