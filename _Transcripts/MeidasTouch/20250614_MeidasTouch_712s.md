**MeidasTouch:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w)
*  That right there was a No Kings protest popping up in Silver Springs, Maryland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=0.0s)]
*  We're seeing these protests spread across the United States today and across the world, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=14.96s)]
*  frankly, we'll be showcasing all of the No Kings protests here on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  You have a war that is now raging in the Middle East between Israel and Iran, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=26.08s)]
*  as you have ICE agents conducting raids here in the United States of factories and restaurants [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=32.72s)]
*  and courthouses, as you have Donald Trump federalizing the National Guard and sending [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  the Marines against people within the United States. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=45.36s)]
*  Donald Trump is holding a dictator parade for himself. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=49.28s)]
*  These are the messages that he's been posting this morning so far. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=54.64s)]
*  A little bit I'll talk about the assassination that took place as well of a lawmaker in Minnesota, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=58.8s)]
*  a horrific assassination in Minnesota. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=68.0s)]
*  I'll talk about that in a moment, but here's what Donald Trump's been posting. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=71.28s)]
*  Happy Flag Day! [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=76.64s)]
*  This is a big day for America. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=79.84s)]
*  Then he puts in all caps. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=83.2s)]
*  Our military parade is on. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=85.76s)]
*  Rain or shine. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=88.72s)]
*  Remember a rainy day parade brings good luck. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=90.64s)]
*  I'll see you all in DC. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=94.4s)]
*  He had to repost that multiple times because he had spelled parade wrong on multiple occasions. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=97.28s)]
*  Let me just share this with you right now. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=104.48s)]

*  No Kings! [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=215.36s)]
*  So while all of this was going on this morning, we learned about the assassination of Minnesota [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=217.36s)]
*  State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  We also learned that there was an attempted murder of the state senator John Hoffman and his wife. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  Fortunately, John Hoffman and his wife, while they were shot, are recovering. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  But state representative Melissa Hortman, who is Speaker Hortman, and her husband were shot and killed by this assassin. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  This is the statement from Akim Jeffries. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=252.56s)]
*  Violence is never acceptable. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=254.56s)]
*  Praying hard for the victims and all who have been affected. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=256.56s)]
*  Just reflecting on what's gone down in the past week. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=260.56s)]
*  Marines were deployed in an American city. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=264.56s)]
*  The president called for a governor, Governor Newsom, to be arrested. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=267.56s)]
*  The Speaker of the House called for that governor to be tarred and feathered. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=271.56s)]
*  A senator from California was pinned and handcuffed. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=276.56s)]
*  Two state legislators have been shot in their homes. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=281.36s)]
*  The details that are still emerging are quite horrific about what happened in Minnesota. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=285.36s)]
*  There was an individual who was impersonating a police officer in a vehicle, SUV I believe, that looks like a police officer's vehicle. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=289.36s)]
*  With the police lights even. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=299.36s)]
*  Showed up dressed as a police officer and engaged in this assassination. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=301.36s)]
*  Here's Minnesota Governor Walz talking about what went down. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=308.16s)]
*  We're here today because an unspeakable tragedy has unfolded in Minnesota. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=312.16s)]
*  My good friend and colleague, Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, were shot and killed early this morning in what appears to be a politically motivated assassination. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=316.16s)]
*  Our state lost a great leader and I lost a dearest of friends. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=326.16s)]
*  Speaker Hortman was someone who served the people of Minnesota with grace, compassion, humor and a sense of service. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  She was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  She woke up every day determined to make this state a better place. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  She is irreplaceable and we've been missed by so many. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  Minnesota's thoughts and prayers are with her family, her loved ones, her children and her parents. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=355.76s)]
*  Here's what the police in Minnesota are saying right now about what went down. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=359.76s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=365.76s)]
*  Can you say it one more time? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=367.76s)]
*  So you were just going to proactively check on the Governor's court and then police there encountered the gunman or someone with a gun and exchanged gunfire. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=369.76s)]
*  Can you just go over that one more time please? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=377.76s)]
*  I can. Good morning. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=379.76s)]
*  Police Chief Mark Rudy, Brooklyn Park Police Department. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=381.76s)]
*  The question is how did we get to Representative Hortman's house and it was proactively or not. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=384.56s)]
*  The circumstances unfolded in Brooklyn Park this morning is that we assisted the Champlain Police Department on a shooting. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=390.56s)]
*  That shooting was made aware by one of our sergeants that it was at Senator Hoffman's home. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=396.56s)]
*  In hearing that, that very intuitive sergeant asked our officers to go check on Melissa Hortman's home, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=400.56s)]
*  a representative that lives in our community, just proactively as due diligence to swing by. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=409.36s)]
*  That police officer and his partner pulled down the street when they arrived at Melissa's house. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=413.36s)]
*  They noticed that there was a police vehicle in the driveway with the lights, emergency lights on and what appeared to be a police officer at the door coming out of the house. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=419.36s)]
*  When our officers confronted them, the individual immediately fired upon the officers who exchanged gunfire and the suspect retreated back into the home. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=427.36s)]
*  Is this an actual police officer or impersonating a police officer? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=438.16s)]
*  Yes, the question is was it a real person or impersonating an impersonating a police officer. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=442.16s)]
*  It was not a real police officer, this is somebody that clearly had been impersonating a police officer. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=448.16s)]
*  Again, using the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=452.16s)]
*  So Chief, you're a natural pair of blood and the person not only was wearing a badge, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=458.16s)]
*  when they approached their victims, they had a car with lights and signs? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes, the question is what kind of vehicle and how were they dressed? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  They did drive a vehicle that looked exactly like an SUV squad car. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  It was equipped with lights, emergency lights that looked exactly like a police vehicle. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes, they were wearing a vest with taser and other equipment that would, a badge very similar to mine. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=483.76s)]
*  No question if they were in this room, you would assume that they are a police officer. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=491.76s)]
*  Although Donald Trump hasn't made any posts from his own personal account about this, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=495.76s)]
*  Caroline Levitt released the statement from Trump saying, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=500.76s)]
*  I've been briefed on the terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=506.56s)]
*  which appears to be a targeted attack against state lawmakers. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=508.56s)]
*  Our Attorney General, Pam Bondi and the FBI are investigating the situation [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=512.56s)]
*  and they will be prosecuting anyone involved to the fullest extent of the law. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=517.56s)]
*  Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=521.56s)]
*  God bless the great people of Minnesota. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=525.56s)]
*  A truly great place! [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=527.56s)]
*  That has not been posted on his personal account as of yet. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=531.3599999999999s)]
*  We're seeing signs like this go up all across the United States right now. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=536.3599999999999s)]
*  People who are being abducted by ICE here in the United States, missing grandmother, missing sons, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=542.3599999999999s)]
*  induced community extinction, more missing mothers, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=549.3599999999999s)]
*  different people going missing as a result of the ICE raids [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=553.3599999999999s)]
*  and people can't find family members here in the United States right now. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=558.16s)]
*  The Middle East is on fire. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=562.16s)]
*  I'll tell you what Israel is saying, I'll tell you what Iran is saying. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=564.16s)]
*  A senior Israeli intelligence official tonight told Fox, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=567.16s)]
*  we have more surprises coming up for Iran following the initial wave of strikes [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=571.16s)]
*  during Operation Rising Lion. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ZbqXGeK1w&t=575.16s)]
