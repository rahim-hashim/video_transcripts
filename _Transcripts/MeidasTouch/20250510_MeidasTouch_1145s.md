# Republicans Caught ALTERING EVIDENCE at MAJOR HEARING
**MeidasTouch:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk)
*  Mago Republicans are at it again altering evidence during congressional hearings [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=0.0s)]
*  To try to attack witnesses as part of whatever their agenda is [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=6.26s)]
*  So here's what went down this past week the Mago Republicans held a Doge committee hearing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=11.4s)]
*  Where they subpoenaed the head of United States fencing like the sport fencing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=16.98s)]
*  Because the Mago Republicans saw some story on Fox about a transgender [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=22.84s)]
*  Fencer so they wanted to go and attack the head of USA fencing even though they received zero federal funding [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=28.02s)]
*  So here's what went down the Mago Republicans were trying to pretend that the head of USA fencing who received all of these death [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=35.86s)]
*  Threats as a result of the doxing from Fox and the Mago Republicans that he was giving the middle finger in a selfie like [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=43.739999999999995s)]
*  F you America and he was actually holding up two fingers [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=51.06s)]
*  But what the Mago Republicans did in the photo was they cropped out one finger to make it look like he was giving the middle finger [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=54.88s)]
*  To the American people now fortunately [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=63.22s)]
*  Democratic Congresswoman [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=66.34s)]
*  Stansberry had the actual photo she was ready to go and she showed what the Mago Republicans were doing here [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=68.26s)]
*  to lie deceive and defame [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=75.82s)]
*  This witness the head of USA fencing is like what why am I even here? What why are you? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=79.18s)]
*  Attacking me here play this clip. I had already spent the money on competition fees and new equipment and spent hours training [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=84.38000000000001s)]
*  I felt trapped. I had been defrauded of a women's tournament and sold a lie by USA fencing [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=90.5s)]
*  Now one big fight Martha has been over a picture of the chairman [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=97.30000000000001s)]
*  Chairman Marjorie Taylor Greene actually brought it up during the hearing and Democrats [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=102.06s)]
*  Said this was a big misrepresentation [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=107.10000000000001s)]
*  representation watch this [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=109.38000000000001s)]
*  Mr. LaFelt came in here today [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=111.58s)]
*  Saying that this is game day. You're right. Mr. LaFelt. This is game day [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=114.38000000000001s)]
*  The document that you have up behind you is a misrepresentation of the actual post [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=119.62s)]
*  It appears that you're trying to misrepresent a witness here one other thing that we should note about [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=124.54s)]
*  This guy who runs USA fencing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=130.94s)]
*  He's received a ton of death threats because of things that I just showed you there the altering of the evidence and the MAGA Republicans [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=133.9s)]
*  Would be like look he's trying to pursue a woke transgender agenda and fencing and so he set his [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=141.01999999999998s)]
*  He set his social media accounts to private because he was getting all of these death threats [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  Then after doxxing and defaming him with altered evidence the MAGA Republicans then attack him [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=154.7s)]
*  For making his social media private as a result of death threats watch this right here for transparency [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=161.7s)]
*  Let's go. Did you recently change your social media profile from public to private? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=168.7s)]
*  I did sir. Okay, was that before or after you got when that you might end up being here today? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=175.06s)]
*  That was around the time that I was receiving death threats and anti-semitic messages [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=180.94s)]
*  Right after you found out that you might be here, correct? I can't recall sir [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=185.38s)]
*  When I was April 14th and he did it after so I'm gonna give you another f2 counts for transparency [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=190.6s)]
*  Now this is part of a broader pattern that we've been covering here at the Midas Touch Network about MAGA's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  Manipulating evidence you'll recall when the MAGA's were so focused on trying to impeach Joe Biden and they were doing Joe Biden [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=204.28s)]
*  Crime family and all of that crap [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=211.32s)]
*  They don't care at all that Donald Trump's actually doing all of the things they lied about with former President Biden [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=213.56s)]
*  They would do things like this right here. They would take like [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  portions of text messages between [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=223.68s)]
*  Like Jim Biden and Joe's brother and Hunter Biden and they would show like a portion but not the full context [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=226.56s)]
*  Like here was a text message that they showed from Jim Biden which says this can work. You need a safe barber [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=234.12s)]
*  I can work with you father alone. We as usual just need several months of his help for this to work [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=240.88s)]
*  Let's talk about it. It makes perfect sense to me. This is difficult to fully vet without talking [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=246.92s)]
*  Will you please call me we can develop a plan together. It can work. I'm going to try to call you again [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=251.82s)]
*  Please answer I can and I will crisis with Caroline same problem with P and New York Post dealing with it as we speak [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=257.44s)]
*  She is okay. I believe I have it under control. I'll get back to you ASAP [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=263.9s)]
*  But now when you look at the actual message that was sent with Jim Biden [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=268.92s)]
*  What it actually says is the following I can work when I'm in New York City all day every day for the next three months [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=273.47999999999996s)]
*  from 8 to 12, but I can't pay alimony without dad or tuitions or [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=280.32s)]
*  For food and gas really it's all gone. I can go make it up in 15 to 20 days [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=285.4s)]
*  I'm sure but he's basically made it clear that he's not paying alimony because mom made clear that she won't do it [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=290.88s)]
*  Haley won't allow me to be at the house or lend me or pay me back any money [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=296.91999999999996s)]
*  Ashley moves into mom mom's house after I told that that I would move in there that night [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=300.76000000000005s)]
*  I told that I want to probably stay in the area and specifically [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=305.58000000000004s)]
*  I wanted to live by you and teach my course at Penn and maybe develop a another one [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=308.48s)]
*  So if you can see right there you can compare where they chopped it off [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=314.16s)]
*  They made it seem like they were engaged in something nefarious where it's actually [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=318.24s)]
*  Hunter Biden at a very vulnerable moment saying that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=322.88s)]
*  You know his dad Joe Biden who wasn't the president then this was in 20 this was in December 29th of 2018 [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=326.79999999999995s)]
*  It was when Trump was in office was basically saying hunter. I can't help you with a lot of things [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=334.35999999999996s)]
*  I can help you with some things to live because [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  Hunter was a drug addict at that time and they were just trying to come up with a plan [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=342.55999999999995s)]
*  For a dad to help his son live. There was nothing nefarious going on how they showed the full context [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=347.52s)]
*  Then [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  You know wouldn't have seemed nefarious [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=354.16s)]
*  And they went from like chopping things off these MAGA Republicans in the prior congressional session to then doing this like they just straight up [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=356.36s)]
*  Used fake text messages like completely bogus false images that hunter never even sent and they tried to make this like [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=363.88s)]
*  The centerpiece of what they were saying and so like if you actually go through it the screen grab images that were posted by the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=371.08000000000004s)]
*  Republicans are not real and containing myriad of issues both include a photo of mr. Biden not from 2017 [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=379.44s)]
*  But from the White House Easter egg roll in April 2022 [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=385.88s)]
*  Long after the purported messages were sent both images portray the message in a blue bubble when whatsapp messages are in green one image [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  Superimposed the Chinese flag for the contact ID when surely that was not how a text or contact was kept and one message purport to be [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=397.0s)]
*  Screenshot with ellipsis of someone composing a text as in the Apple's iMessage when that does not happen in whatsapp in short [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=404.76s)]
*  The images you circulated online are complete fakes many media articles confirm the data [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=412.04s)]
*  Purported to have come from the devices has been altered and manipulated you or someone else did that again [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=417.32s)]
*  I mean if you did this in court you would lose your bar license [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=422.76s)]
*  But because that the MAGA Republicans keep doing this stuff in Congress they claim oh we get speech or debate clause immunity [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=426.64s)]
*  watch as [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=434.2s)]
*  AOC in the last congressional session called them out for doing it here play this clip earlier today [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=436.2s)]
*  One of our colleagues a gentleman from Florida presented up on this screen [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=442.28000000000003s)]
*  something that looked appeared to be a [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=446.88s)]
*  screenshot of a text message containing or insinuating an explosive allegation [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=450.44s)]
*  that screenshot of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=456.08s)]
*  What appeared to be a text message was a fabricated image? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=458.36s)]
*  It was a fabricated image. I don't know where it came from [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't know if it was the staff of the committee [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=468.6s)]
*  But it was not the actual direct screenshot from that phone and in fact I would like to submit [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=470.8s)]
*  to [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=476.92s)]
*  the committee the actual full [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=478.2s)]
*  context [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=481.96s)]
*  from as it from the Ziegler affid affidavit number one exhibit 402 of the full [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=483.24s)]
*  Text of that exchange do I have permission from the chair? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=490.32s)]
*  Importantly [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=495.04s)]
*  What was brought out from from that fabricated image excluded critical context that changed the underlying [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=497.76s)]
*  Meaning and allegation that was presented up on that screen by this committee and by by members of this committee [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=505.4s)]
*  Now they are well within their right to do that [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=513.72s)]
*  Because they are covered by the speech and debate clause [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=517.4s)]
*  This was not submitted by a material or fact witness under oath [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=520.56s)]
*  That was not submitted by material or fact witness under oath. Are you ready to jumpstart your health in 2025? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=525.2399999999999s)]

*  Well, what we do with this bill is we prevent that from from happening, but what we don't [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=714.0s)]
*  Take out what can you name a school where it has been confirmed that students are using litter boxes [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=721.62s)]
*  This was at the top of your press release. This was mentioned when you introduced this bill [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=727.38s)]
*  Created quite a stir. So I'm asking can you name a school where it's been confirmed that there are litter boxes being provided to students [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=732.3199999999999s)]
*  For this purpose. I know I cannot your tweet about this bill was flagged by the app itself under their community notes and [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=741.12s)]

*  What is it community notes? Okay. I [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=764.64s)]
*  Find it concerning that these types of [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=767.96s)]
*  debunked conspiracy theories are being used [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=771.12s)]
*  By politicians at the highest levels of our government including in this legislature [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=773.96s)]
*  Who know that they're incorrect? Are you aware that governor Abbott said quote kids go to school dressed up as cats with litter [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=779.28s)]
*  boxes in their classrooms [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=786.76s)]
*  Sure [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=789.76s)]
*  Are you also aware that when the governor was asked by the Dallas Morning News to name a single school where this happened? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=792.12s)]
*  he couldn't and [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=797.3199999999999s)]
*  PolitiFact called this a pants-on-fire false claim started by online rumors [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=799.52s)]
*  Okay, do you think it's a good use of our time to write laws based on debunked internet conspiracy theories? Well, this isn't [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=805.48s)]
*  this [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=813.96s)]
*  piece of legislation before us [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=815.04s)]
*  Covers that among other things that [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=817.7199999999999s)]
*  Are true and then you have James Tallarico again [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=823.88s)]
*  cross-examining this guy who put forward the legislation and basically showing that like [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=829.3199999999999s)]
*  Don't you have better things to do than like just make up fake things and try to criminalize like licking your fingers and you're saying people [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=834.56s)]
*  Are becoming cats like what the hell are you doing here? You're play this clip [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=841.28s)]
*  I want to ask you a few questions about the language of the bill. So your bill provides [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=845.0s)]
*  Includes language that prohibits students from engaging in certain types of quote non-human behavior [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=852.2s)]
*  Which is defined as including quote licking oneself or others [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=858.5600000000001s)]
*  End quote. Is that correct? That's correct [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=864.24s)]
*  I [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=867.64s)]
*  Am worried that there are developmentally normal behaviors things that any child might do that could be punished under the language because it's [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=869.0799999999999s)]
*  So broad and unclear [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=876.48s)]
*  So let's just use this example because there are actual monetary fines [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=879.4s)]
*  Along with your bills. This is not just a humorous thing [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=885.12s)]
*  There are real consequences if a student eats Cheetos and then licks the cheese dust off their fingers [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=887.68s)]
*  Would that be considered licking oneself? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=894.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=896.7199999999999s)]
*  That's good. That's not a non-human behavior if you're licking your fingers as you got food on them [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=897.8s)]
*  That's kind of in line with a normal [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=903.12s)]
*  Behavior, but you're defining non-human behavior as licking oneself or others [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=905.64s)]
*  If it's in this non-human behavior [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=909.96s)]
*  realm the intent of the belt is if for [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=913.88s)]
*  Licking oneself for the grooming purposes like a cat. So who decides whether the licking is [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=917.96s)]
*  Non-human behavior is that the Attorney General's job if your bill becomes law the local school districts come up with their plan [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=926.1600000000001s)]
*  But all there needs to be is one complaint and the Attorney General the top cop in the second largest state in the Union [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=932.6s)]
*  Is now tasked with investigating that behavior. I mean, I would just hope that the Attorney General has better things to do than investigating [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=939.6800000000001s)]
*  lip [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=947.6400000000001s)]
*  Licking or or [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=951.0400000000001s)]
*  That kind of behavior among kids, you know [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=953.3199999999999s)]
*  But then you have the situation like when cash Patel testified in Congress this past week where he got mad at Senator [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=955.48s)]
*  Patty Murray after he didn't even show up with his actual [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=962.7199999999999s)]
*  Budget which you're supposed to show up and actually do your homework [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=966.48s)]
*  But then he like yells at the questioning when they get cornered when they know they're caught lying. What do they do? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=969.52s)]
*  They go. I'm just not gonna tolerate you anymore. I'm not gonna tolerate you here play this clip placed on leave FBI employees [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=975.76s)]
*  Responsible for the investigation of January 6th. That sounds political to me [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=983.7199999999999s)]
*  I have not placed anyone on leave who has not violated their ethical obligation or their oath to the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=988.0999999999999s)]
*  They were investigating January 6th. You believe they were violating an ethic of nope [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=995.0s)]
*  I think the common theme here is you putting words in my mouth and I'm not gonna tolerate it [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=999.8s)]
*  No, will the men and women of the FBI? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1003.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, you did place on leave an analyst responsible for investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 election [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1006.1999999999999s)]
*  Is that politicization is that retribution? No, not if she broke the law or the ethical guidelines [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1012.44s)]
*  I don't know which case you're talking about [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1018.04s)]
*  But that's the standard and we will hold ourselves inwardly accountable and we will not be [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1019.36s)]
*  Strayed from our mission because people think we are politicizing the bureau [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1024.48s)]
*  If you want to talk about someone who was attacked by a weaponized bureau [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1027.8s)]
*  You're looking at him and now he's the director of the FBI and he's cleaning it up [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1030.92s)]
*  And finally the messaging from Fox though, and this is what I think is important to tie this all together [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1034.48s)]
*  The messaging from state regime media known as Fox is basically who cares about evidence [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1040.2199999999998s)]
*  It doesn't matter like just if you think people are bad [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1046.58s)]
*  They don't need due process just throw whoever you want to throw in jail if you're the regime here watch this with all due respect [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1050.62s)]
*  This whole argument about these Venezuelan gang members or people who say they aren't in a gang [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1057.06s)]
*  But they've got MS 13 and code on their knuckles [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1062.06s)]
*  And argued against using tattoos to say if someone's a member of MS 13 [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1069.86s)]
*  So anyone who has a tie to MS 13 or the government suspects of it if you tell me that they deserve due process [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1073.82s)]
*  I'll tell you that I know Lake and Riley's dad and I would go out and kick every one of them off this cut out of [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1080.1399999999999s)]
*  This country just because of Lake and Riley [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1085.6599999999999s)]
*  So when Frederica Wilson says something like there are more people are getting rolled up because of Lake and Riley you're damn right [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1087.6999999999998s)]
*  They are because this whole country saw what happened to Lake and Riley and we said hell no [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEv1nrdkLk&t=1093.4199999999998s)]
