# Latino Trump Voters REVOLT as HE SCREWS THEM
**MeidasTouch:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0)
*  Trump voters are getting a rude awakening, it seems, every single day, whether it's Donald Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=0.0s)]
*  posting about reopening Alcatraz or AI images of himself as the Pope, as the world is grieving the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=5.44s)]
*  passing of Pope Francis, whether it's Donald Trump's trade wars against the world, or Donald Trump [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=13.52s)]
*  saying he doesn't know if he needs to follow the Constitution and saying that he doesn't believe [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  immigrants should get due process and that they shouldn't get trials at all. When we're looking [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=25.6s)]
*  at the polling data, we're seeing some of the biggest drop-off as well among Trump voters, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=30.96s)]
*  Latino voters for Trump now overwhelmingly disapprove of Donald Trump. And you remember [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=36.96s)]
*  we were showing you videos like this leading up to the election and even thereafter. Let's play [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  this clip right here. If they let in hundreds or thousands of people who already have criminal [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=50.16s)]
*  records, if deporting them creates a mass deportation, I'm all for it. But what if [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=55.36s)]
*  rounded up in all of that are people who work on a farm? They're doing the jobs that Americans [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  don't want to do. Does that worry you? That wouldn't be fair. Of course, you know, they need to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=65.36s)]
*  make sure that they don't throw away, they don't kick out, they don't deport people that are [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=69.84s)]
*  family-oriented. That are family-oriented. Let's bring in Arizona Senator Ruben [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=74.0s)]
*  Gallego. Senator Gallego, you were warning leading up to the 2024 election about Latino defections, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=79.12s)]
*  and that was one of the things that we saw. So tell us what are you seeing now? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=87.44s)]
*  Well, I certainly have seen a reversal mostly among Latino men. And I would say it started about [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=92.64s)]
*  three to four weeks ago. So it's a combination really of the fact that they're deporting people [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=99.12s)]
*  that aren't criminals, that they're separating families, all these things that either A, a lot [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=106.0s)]
*  of these voters lied to themselves and said that that wasn't going to happen, or, you know, let's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=111.28s)]
*  be clear, Trump at different points in time will actually say the same thing. And he just said it [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  two weeks ago, like we shouldn't be deporting anybody that's here working, right? And he'll kind [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=119.92s)]
*  of drop these nuggets here and there to kind of give hope to some of these people that some firm, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=124.0s)]
*  some reason would want to believe them. But the economy is the other thing that kind of has really [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=128.08s)]
*  pushed these guys back out of at least not being big, big supporters of Donald Trump. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  You know, Latinos are, you know, much like, especially Latino men, I'm sorry, just like [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  black men, they're the first to fire and the last to hire. You know, when wages get stagnant, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  they're the ones that feel it right away. It's all these things that they are more sensitive when [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  things start going bad. And I guarantee you that if the economy, which it is, is slowing down, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=154.16s)]
*  they're the ones that are feeling it right now. And I think that's why you're seeing these numbers [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=158.88s)]
*  kind of change. Let's talk about the economy because, you know, the markets are very volatile. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=162.0s)]
*  It seems one day Trump or Scott Bessent, his Treasury Secretary, will talk about, oh, there [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=169.04s)]
*  may be a deal, there may be that. And so the market has these massive fluctuations. But I think [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=175.12s)]
*  systemically when you take a step back and you're looking at the shrinkage in the GDP, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=180.48s)]
*  you're looking at freight volumes and trucking volumes, another story's emerging. Can you speak [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=185.04s)]
*  to what you're seeing, Senator? Yeah. So these Latinos men and women aren't basing their feelings [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=189.6s)]
*  on the stock market. Not that some of them don't invest in the stock market, some of them that, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  I'm sure, half 401k IRAs are, you know, aren't invested themselves. What they're responding to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=202.64s)]
*  is the slowdown in the economy, right? These are the men and women that are your truck drivers, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=208.56s)]
*  your delivery, you know, short haul delivery people. They're the ones that work at factories, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=213.84s)]
*  they're the ones that do hourly work. And when they feel the contraction in the economy, they're [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=219.28s)]
*  the first ones that feel it, right? They're the waiters. So like if they start seeing tips being, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=224.16s)]
*  less tips coming in, you know, they're the ones that are working at factories, the ones that are [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=230.16s)]
*  working on construction sites. And so if there's any slowdown, they're the first ones to feel it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=234.08s)]
*  And that is what they're responding to. So Besant and the president can come and say whatever they [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  want to kind of ease the markets. If these men and women feel that they are unstable, uncertain [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  about their future, they're getting fired, or they're getting their hours reduced, they're going to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=253.52s)]
*  be unhappy. It doesn't matter what the stock market is doing. And, you know, if you look at what [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  happened in the first quarter, you know, GDP contracted by 0.3%. And that's, you know, not [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=262.32s)]
*  that's even before terrorists are fully get queued in, wait to see what happens second term. So this [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=268.8s)]
*  is something that is going to negatively give an opinion. They're just not going to, you know, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=274.96s)]
*  right now, they're not going to trust Republicans when it comes to the economy and immigration, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=280.56s)]
*  which are the two things that a lot of them did trust last time going around. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=284.32s)]
*  Well, how could they trust your Republican colleagues when you try to show objective data [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=287.76s)]
*  to them about the economy? What do they say? But have you read the art of the deal? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=292.96s)]
*  Have you read the art of the deal? It's a book, everybody. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=297.76s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I never talk, I never try to talk to anybody about like, bring objective data to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=300.56s)]
*  to the conversation. You know, I try to keep it extremely as close to reality as possible. And [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  like, you know, what they understand and which would help not just the team is very understands, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=311.52s)]
*  like, you know, are your wages going higher? Have prices gone down? And normally they just tell me, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=316.8s)]
*  no, that's not the case. And, you know, if you do that enough, they'll figure it out. And, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=323.44s)]
*  you know, the I think there's going to be a lot of spinning that's going to happen [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=329.68s)]
*  from the right from Donald Trump. At the end of the day, you know, inflation still high, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  you still can't buy a house in Arizona rent still high, you can't buy a vehicle cheaply anymore. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=339.52s)]
*  And now there's a really good chance that you're going to be losing your job. So everything that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=346.64s)]
*  that that any trust that they've had for this president is now quickly, quickly eroding. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=351.12s)]
*  You're a veteran, you were in the Marines. I want to ask you your view about how [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=358.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's been handling the military, Pete Hegseth's careless handling of classified [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=362.56s)]
*  information, cutting of the VA. What have you made of all of their moves there? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=369.2s)]
*  Yeah, let me let's start with two separate things. Number one, this administration is the most [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=375.36s)]
*  anti veteran administration in the history of this country. And I'm not even close, right? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=379.20000000000005s)]
*  You know, today we had the VA secretary at our committee hearing, and he could not pinpoint why [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=385.68s)]
*  and where he came about that he wanted to cut the workforce of the VA by 15%. There's no logical [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=392.48s)]
*  reason to it. There's no study. There's nothing. They just came up with this number, some Doge [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=397.04s)]
*  boy out of San Jose, California, who has zero experience with the VA came up with this number [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=401.12s)]
*  and now they're executing it. Recently, they tried to float the idea of changing Veterans Day to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=406.96s)]
*  World War Two Day, World War One Day. Like, how stupid are you to even think about that? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=413.36s)]
*  There's veterans that are starting to see the effects of some of these cuts, where you were [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=419.2s)]
*  hearing about therapists that have to have some of their sessions in open air cubicles, which is [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=423.44s)]
*  horrible for privacy matters. It is all, all bad. And it doesn't surprise me again, this man has [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=429.12s)]
*  zero concept of selflessness, self-service or service to the country. And, you know, he thinks [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=436.48s)]
*  if he just acts tough, that the veterans would be happy with him in the end. And that's not the case [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=442.8s)]
*  on the military side. You know, the lack of leadership from Hegseth, as well as just the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=448.08s)]
*  fact that they're entirely eroding our world alliances and making the world more unstable [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=456.16s)]
*  is what I think also pisses off a lot of veterans. We feel that, you know, the he's the president's [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  pissing away years and years of a stable relationship with a stable and reliable alliance [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=467.44s)]
*  with our European partners. They're making us weaker versus China. All these things that, you know, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  some of these veterans and people that were military men did not think would happen are now [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=480.48s)]
*  happening. In addition to just, you know, again, the hypocrisy of something like Hegseth talking [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=485.04s)]
*  about, you know, the security, operational security that, you know, we need and then engaging [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=492.40000000000003s)]
*  such really, really risky information sharing that would have gotten me thrown in jail when I was in [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=498.48s)]
*  the Marines. Talk about your trip. You're going to Bucks County. I understand as soon. What's the, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=504.24s)]
*  they're calling it, the press is calling it shadow primaries. What are you calling it? Why are you [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=512.72s)]
*  getting there? Well, we're going there because we got invited to go and we've gotten invites to a [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=519.28s)]
*  lot of places to speak about Medicaid and Democrats. And this is something that I've done [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  before being a senator traveling the country. You know, even in Arizona, this last couple months, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=529.52s)]
*  I've been traveling to red parts of Arizona to talk about the cuts they want to do to Medicaid, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=535.6s)]
*  how people are going to get kicked off healthcare, how hospitals are going to shut down, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=539.84s)]
*  maternity wards are going to shut down all because these guys want to give a massive, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=543.36s)]
*  massive tax cuts to billionaires that don't need it and won't even notice it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=547.2s)]
*  The one, the Bucks County actually works within my schedule. I have a pretty busy schedule largely [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=550.96s)]
*  because I have two kids and I have a third one coming June 12th. But again, I look forward to [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  talking to the people in Bucks County. They're much like the swing voters in Arizona. They want [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=560.5600000000001s)]
*  to hear the straight truth. They want to know that the government's looking out for them. And they [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=564.88s)]
*  certainly don't want to be seeing really critical programs like food stamps, like Medicaid being [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=569.28s)]
*  cut just to help the mega, mega rich. I want to talk about this crypto bill. It's not getting [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=575.28s)]
*  a lot of attention. You posted about it recently as well. I think this began as a bipartisan effort [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=580.56s)]
*  in theory to put guard rails on these stable coins, build an ethic system around it and saying, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  hey, this is the wild, wild west. Let's rein it in a little bit. So this started with great [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=595.84s)]
*  intentions. But as you just posted the other day, well, Politico wrote Democrats reverse course to [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=602.96s)]
*  oppose the Senate crypto bill. But you wrote, this isn't like a reversal out of nowhere by Dems. The [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=608.48s)]
*  fact of the matter is Dems, including me and my team, were trying to negotiate with Republicans [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=613.44s)]
*  for weeks. The bill that was introduced for floor consideration backpedaled on a lot of progress we [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=617.84s)]
*  made and did not include other improvements we sought. It seems they want us to suck it up and [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=622.64s)]
*  vote for this bill without our input. That's not what we expected during this negotiation and not [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  how I operate. Our statement makes clear we won't let them jam us. Looking forward to continuing to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=631.36s)]
*  get this bill in a better place. Let's talk about this one first. But then I think it goes to this [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=636.4s)]
*  broader systemic issue where here you are trying to engage people who are difficult to engage with. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=642.4s)]
*  And then they kind of go sideways on you and trying to change the deal and then make it [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=648.96s)]
*  something that's less palatable. So talk about this bill first. Is it a big deal? What's happening? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=653.52s)]
*  Well, it is a big deal. Like, you know, we need to we do need to get some legislation through [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=658.32s)]
*  and reason why because every other country now has some level of stable coin legislation. And we [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=662.4s)]
*  want to also have that industry, that economy here. But we also want consumer protections. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=666.96s)]
*  We want national security protections, anti-money laundering protections. And these are things that [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=673.36s)]
*  are fairly reasonable. And I had been working with Republicans and five Democrats on the [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=678.16s)]
*  committee who had worked in actually passed. And we we said when we passed, like, there's more to do. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=684.0s)]
*  But we want to continue in a spirit of bipartisan to work on this. And all of a sudden, the language [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=688.0799999999999s)]
*  changed. They backtracked on some of the stuff we had already approved. They weren't, you know, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=693.4399999999999s)]
*  even moving forward with further legislation. And then they announced the date of the first vote. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=698.16s)]
*  And I think the purpose of that was really to put Democrats in a bad position and try to [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  force us to vote for it. And, you know, as the ranking member on the on the committee, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=707.92s)]
*  I just cannot allow them to just jam us and pass bad legislation that has, you know, open loopholes [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=714.88s)]
*  that will create, you know, really bad situations for consumers, for investors, all these kinds of [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=721.8399999999999s)]
*  things, especially when we're here, we're here to work, we're here to speak and try to come up with [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=727.92s)]
*  a good bipartisan bill. But don't try to fuck us on it. Like, that's not going to happen. Right. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=734.16s)]
*  And they're trying to do these threats where like, oh, if you do this, you know, the crypto [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=739.52s)]
*  industry is going to say that you're anti crypto, we're all going to label you guys as anti crypto. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=743.76s)]
*  And that only makes me even more intensely mad at them, because now you're just doing more and more [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=748.4s)]
*  threats. We can get a good bill, we could get a good bill that protects consumers, protects investors, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=753.1999999999999s)]
*  brings back a lot of this innovation back to the United States. And we have the time to do it. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=759.12s)]
*  But you can't throw us in the corner, you can't try to fuck us and then say like, hey, you know, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=763.6s)]
*  deal with it like that's just not going to work, especially when you still need our votes, no matter [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=768.8000000000001s)]
*  what. You know, I read I read the bill assignment dork like that. And one of the things that I saw [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=772.8000000000001s)]
*  in that they were trying to jam through seemed to me in my reading of it was some exemption for [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=778.16s)]
*  the presidency that like Donald Trump is not he gets to do deals with Abu Dhabi and whoever he [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=784.24s)]
*  wants to do it with. It doesn't apply to him. It applies to every was that in there? Or was I was [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=790.16s)]
*  I reading that writer? So we have had an understanding that there was going to be this is not a Trump [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=794.64s)]
*  focused thing that there's going to be a general understanding of what you would do with any type [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=800.24s)]
*  of industry currency altogether. And that means that the president, the vice president and members [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=805.36s)]
*  the executive cannot engage in this because it is essentially self dealing, right? Same with senators, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=810.88s)]
*  by the way, and same with members of Congress, they should not be able to issue their own stable [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=817.04s)]
*  coin, issue their own coin in general, anything like that, you should not be able to do it. So [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=821.28s)]
*  that was our understanding. And again, this isn't a Trump focused thing, he is going to be able to [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=827.12s)]
*  do his meme coins all he wants. That's a totally different subject matter. But no one is going to [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=831.5999999999999s)]
*  have an exemption at all on this. And that's not the biggest hang up on this at all. It's the fact [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=837.28s)]
*  that they're backsliding on their word and again, trying to basically force our hands. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=842.32s)]
*  And that's my opinion, I think that's going to work. Senators, are there any other issues? I [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=847.44s)]
*  always like to ask this when I have senators on here or governors, because there's things that I'm [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=852.8000000000001s)]
*  not seeing. And you probably don't get asked some of these questions because the reporters have, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=857.84s)]
*  they go in with a series of questions. Are there any other areas that you think is not getting [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=863.5200000000001s)]
*  enough attention that you want people to know about in front of this, in front of the huge [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=868.24s)]
*  audience that we have here that you think, look, we need to be spending more time on this or that, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=872.72s)]
*  or here's what I'm focused on right now? Well, look, I'm focused on a couple of things. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=878.16s)]
*  Housing, we just need to figure out how to get as much housing online as fast as possible. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=883.28s)]
*  You know, when we talk about it, like everyone thinks about it in the way, like, yes, it's [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=891.6s)]
*  important for us to ask for people to be housed, right? We don't want homeless people, but it's [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=894.48s)]
*  also important for a couple reasons. Number one, financial stability. You know, people that have [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=898.4s)]
*  homes are more likely to, are less likely to end up below the poverty line, are more likely to have [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  better healthcare outcomes. Children, when are raised in a stable housing environment, end up [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=910.4s)]
*  also having better healthcare and educational and societal outcomes, right? The fact is right now, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=917.2s)]
*  people in their mid thirties are not going to be able to buy homes for quite a while. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=923.52s)]
*  There's just not enough market that, not bringing about to the market. And when you're, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=927.8399999999999s)]
*  even when it is there, it's extremely expensive and interest rates are so high. And then you're [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=932.64s)]
*  not also creating generational wealth. And then also like at some point, it's just damn depressing, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=937.68s)]
*  right? Like I was lucky enough, I used the VA home bill at 26 to buy my first condo. But, you know, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=943.76s)]
*  there are men and women that are at home with their parents leading up into their forties. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=951.68s)]
*  But like, no matter what we say, that's just not good for society, right? You want people to be [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=956.3199999999999s)]
*  happy, proud of themselves, be able to start families or not start families, but living on [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=960.56s)]
*  their own independent lives. And we need to make sure that governance is focused on figuring out [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=964.3199999999999s)]
*  how does that look like? And it could be a combination of things like making sure we have [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=968.2399999999999s)]
*  housing subsidies, low income housing, affordable mortgages. We need to make sure that cities don't [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=971.68s)]
*  overregulate and underzone those areas. That's step one of those areas that we should be working [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=979.04s)]
*  on intensely as Democrats. And the other area is energy. If you're on your phone and you're [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=984.56s)]
*  doing anything with your phone, with computers, AI or anything else like that, you are causing a [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=991.68s)]
*  lot of energy. And the United States is going to have a big problem in about 10 years if we don't [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=995.5999999999999s)]
*  upgrade our energy, energy grids, as well as trying to bring more energy on. And of course, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=1000.88s)]
*  a lot of that will be renewables, but I also do believe that we have to really look at nuclear. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=1006.56s)]
*  And I think that's something that Democrats don't usually engage in. But in order for us to make [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=1012.16s)]
*  sure that working class people are going to be able to have affordable energy and still keep the [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=1016.0s)]
*  lights on and still be able to have the kind of high tech jobs we want, we're going to have to do [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=1020.2399999999999s)]
*  a massive investment in nuclear, which by the way, will also keep our carbon footprint down. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=1024.48s)]
*  And it's one of the things I'm working on right now actively is trying to figure out how we can [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=1029.9199999999998s)]
*  get more nuclear energy deployed across the country. Senator Ruben Gallego, thank you so much. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=1033.68s)]
*  There you go. You didn't see that one coming, did you? I did not see that one coming. But I'm glad [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=1039.6000000000001s)]
*  we had you on. We'd love to have you back on as well. And thanks for all you do. Yeah, please do. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_6HIoUE8B0&t=1044.16s)]
