# YIKES! Trump DESTROYS LIVES of his OWN DOJ Lawyers
**MeidasTouch:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E)
*  Over and over again, Donald Trump keeps throwing his DOJ lawyers under the bus. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=0.0s)]
*  They may find themselves being held in criminal contempt soon, potentially even losing their [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=7.08s)]
*  legal license, their bar license, or being put in prison for violating court orders. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=13.36s)]
*  When Donald Trump is asked, why are you violating the Supreme Court's 9-0 order, saying, Donald, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=19.96s)]
*  you've got to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia, who your regime disappeared to a concentration [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=27.12s)]
*  camp in El Salvador without due process. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=33.72s)]
*  You need to facilitate his return to the United States, provide him with due process, and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=36.88s)]
*  then you can go from there. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=41.6s)]
*  Why aren't you following the Supreme Court's order? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=43.02s)]
*  Donald Trump consistently says, because my own DOJ lawyers said that I won in front of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=45.72s)]
*  this Supreme Court and that I don't need to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=51.72s)]
*  And most recently, in this disastrous interview that Donald Trump gave with ABC on his 100 [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=56.96s)]
*  days in office, the most disastrous 100 days in the history of the presidency, Donald Trump [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=63.08s)]
*  said, my lawyers are telling me that I don't need to do anything. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=68.56s)]
*  In fact, what Donald Trump said is, if I wanted to, Trump says, I could facilitate the return [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=72.4s)]
*  of Abrego Garcia. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=80.04s)]
*  Donald Trump says, yeah, I have the ability and power to pick up the phone and give a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=81.68s)]
*  phone call to the leader of El Salvador, Naib Buccelli, and ask for the return. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=87.04s)]
*  And yeah, he would return Abrego Garcia, I'm sure, if I ask him. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=92.28s)]
*  But Donald Trump said, my lawyers say I don't need to do that, so I'm not going to do that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  We all know what the Supreme Court order says. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=102.72s)]
*  It says you need to facilitate the return and take steps to do that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=105.04s)]
*  So if Donald Trump's lawyers are really saying that to Donald Trump, then they're going to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=108.64s)]
*  be in big trouble before the various federal courts, not just the one in Maryland involving [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=114.36s)]
*  the Abrego Garcia case, but there are federal courts throughout the country now where we're [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=122.12s)]
*  also seeing these types of orders where Donald Trump disappeared migrants to El Salvador. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=126.76s)]
*  I want to show you what Donald Trump said. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=132.08s)]
*  I want to go through the specific language with you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=133.84s)]
*  But I think it's notable that the federal judge in Maryland, Judge Zinnis, in the case [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=136.56s)]
*  of Abrego Garcia, while there was a temporary pause that took place in that case on the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=141.4s)]
*  expedited discovery that Judge Zinnis had ordered regarding why Abrego Garcia was sent [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=148.72s)]
*  to El Salvador, the steps that are being taken for his return, this pause in discovery has [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=156.96s)]
*  now ended. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=162.8s)]
*  I think that pause was because there were representations made to the court confidentially [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=163.88000000000002s)]
*  that there were steps being taken to try to facilitate the return, which was then not [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=169.12s)]
*  carried out. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  And now the judge, Judge Zinnis, has ordered, let's go, expedited discovery. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=175.4s)]
*  I want it all done by May 9th. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=180.24s)]
*  And I think Judge Zinnis is teeing this all up to make a contempt finding, a criminal [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  contempt finding. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=187.84s)]
*  And this is a no-nonsense judge that I think is pissed at the violations of her court order [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=189.56s)]
*  and what the Supreme Court ruled, which is facilitate the return forthwith. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=195.0s)]
*  So here's what Donald Trump said in his interview with ABC this past week. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=200.6s)]
*  Donald Trump's talking about Abrego Garcia and Terry Moran. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=205.36s)]
*  The ABC reporter says, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=209.04s)]
*  Terry Moran says, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=220.56s)]
*  Donald Trump says, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=225.72s)]
*  Terry Moran says, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=227.48s)]
*  And Terry Moran says, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=232.08s)]
*  Donald Trump says, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=240.6s)]
*  But then Donald Trump blames his lawyers. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=242.6s)]
*  And he says, well, I followed the law, Trump says, and my lawyers say, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=245.04s)]
*  I don't need to do that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=249.6s)]
*  Let me play this clip for you. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=251.04s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=252.48s)]
*  And now the Supreme Court has upheld an order that you must return him to facilitate his [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=279.56s)]
*  return to the United States. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=285.52s)]
*  What are you doing to comply? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=286.88s)]
*  Well, the lawyer that said it was a mistake was here a long time, was not appointed by [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=287.88s)]
*  us, should not have said that, should not have said that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=292.8s)]
*  And to say, you understand, the person that you're talking about, you know, you're making [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=296.56s)]
*  this person sound, this is a MS-13 gang member, a tough cookie, been in lots of skirmishes, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=300.12s)]
*  beat the hell out of his wife. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=307.72s)]
*  And the wife was petrified to even talk about him, okay? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=309.64s)]
*  This is not an innocent, wonderful gentleman from Maryland. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=312.8s)]
*  I'm not saying he's a good guy. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=315.76s)]
*  It's about the rule of law. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=317.12s)]
*  The order from the Supreme Court stands, sir. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=318.12s)]
*  You came into our country illegally. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=320.2s)]
*  You could get him back. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=322.04s)]
*  There's a phone on this desk. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=323.04s)]
*  I could. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  You could pick it up and like all the power of the presidency, you could call up the president [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  of El Salvador and say, send him back right now. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=328.44s)]
*  And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=330.72s)]
*  But the court has ordered you to facilitate that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm not the one making this decision. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  We have lawyers that don't want to do this. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=338.8s)]
*  But the buck stops in his office. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=343.04s)]
*  I follow the law. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=344.04s)]
*  You want me to follow the law? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  If I were the president that just wanted to do anything, I'd probably keep him right where [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=346.52000000000004s)]
*  he is. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  The Supreme Court says what the law is. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  There's another instance in that interview as well, where the reporter, Terry Moran, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  says, look, Donald, the law requires that every single person get due process, that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=358.68s)]
*  there is a process that is provided to them. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  And Trump says, that's not what my lawyers have told me. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=370.76s)]
*  Here, including terrorists, by the way. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=371.76s)]
*  Now, but we give them a hearing when they came in. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, the law requires that every single person who is going to be deported gets a hearing [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=377.16s)]
*  first. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=382.6s)]
*  Well, I'll have to ask the lawyers about that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=383.6s)]
*  All I can say is this. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=386.72s)]
*  If you're going to have 21 million people and we have to get a lot of them out because [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=388.36s)]
*  they're criminals, we're going to have to act fast. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=392.12s)]
*  We can't. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=395.20000000000005s)]
*  Do you think we can give 21 million trials? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=396.20000000000005s)]
*  Let's say each trial takes two weeks. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=400.0s)]
*  Is that what you want us to do? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=402.36s)]
*  The law is the law, sir. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=403.36s)]
*  The law is the law. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  The law doesn't say anything about trials. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=405.96000000000004s)]
*  No, not trials. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=407.96000000000004s)]
*  Hearings. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  These people came in. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=409.96000000000004s)]
*  They're not citizens. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  They came in illegally. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=411.96000000000004s)]
*  They came into a country illegally. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  We have to get them out. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=414.20000000000005s)]
*  There's a legal process for that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  I can't be sure. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=416.84000000000003s)]
*  And we follow the legal process. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=417.84000000000003s)]
*  I can't. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=419.2s)]
*  I can't have a trial, a major trial for every person that came in illegally. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=420.2s)]
*  If you go through Donald Trump's Time magazine interview from last week and you see what [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=425.84s)]
*  Donald Trump said, you'll see that he consistently throws his lawyers under the bus as well. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=430.0s)]
*  By the way, all of this is going to be used in these federal court proceedings. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=435.32s)]
*  So this was the Time magazine interview. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=439.96s)]
*  Donald, you committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=441.64s)]
*  Trump says yes. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=445.2s)]
*  The interview and I last spoke April. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=446.2s)]
*  Are you still committed to complying with the Supreme Court orders? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=447.68s)]
*  Trump goes, sure. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=451.0s)]
*  I believe in the court system. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=452.0s)]
*  The reporter goes, well, the Supreme Court ruled nine to zero that you have to bring [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=453.53999999999996s)]
*  back Abrego Garcia. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=457.56s)]
*  You haven't done so. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  Are you disobeying the Supreme Court? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=460.32s)]
*  Trump goes, well, that's not what my people told me. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=462.96s)]
*  They didn't say it was. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=465.44s)]
*  They said it was the nine to nothing was something entirely different. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=466.68s)]
*  Then the reporter goes, well, let me quote from the ruling, quote, the order properly [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=470.88s)]
*  requires the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=474.84s)]
*  Are you facilitating the release? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=480.23999999999995s)]
*  Trump goes, I leave that to my lawyers. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=482.52s)]
*  I give them no instructions. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=484.28s)]
*  They feel that the order said something very much different from what you're saying, but [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=486.35999999999996s)]
*  I leave that to my lawyers. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=490.35999999999996s)]
*  If they want, and that would be the attorney general of the United States and the people [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=491.9s)]
*  that represent the country, I don't make that decision. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  Maybe, but Mr. President, whatever he might have done, Abrego, whoever he might be affiliated [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=500.44s)]
*  with, doesn't he deserve his day in court? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=506.48s)]
*  And Trump goes, I really just give that to my lawyers to determine. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=509.0s)]
*  That's why I have them. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=512.8000000000001s)]
*  That's not my determination. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=514.6s)]
*  It's something that frankly bringing him back and retrying him wouldn't bother me, but I [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=516.84s)]
*  leave that up to my lawyer. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=521.48s)]
*  You could bring him back and retry him. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=523.8000000000001s)]
*  To which the reporter goes, that's exactly right. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=526.2s)]
*  You could fix this simply by bringing him back and going through a legal process. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=528.68s)]
*  To which Trump says one more time, but I leave that decision to the lawyers. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=533.56s)]
*  At this moment, they, the lawyers, just don't want to do that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=538.2399999999999s)]
*  They say that we're in total compliance with the Supreme Court. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=543.1999999999999s)]
*  And Trump goes on to say that over and over again. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=548.28s)]
*  Just one other point I want to bring up here as well. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=552.12s)]
*  Remember in the earlier clip I showed you, Donald Trump said that Abrego Garcia's wife [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=554.48s)]
*  doesn't want to talk to him or hates him or words to that effect. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=560.6s)]
*  Just so I can fact check everything that Donald Trump is saying, this is the wife of Abrego [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=565.12s)]
*  Garcia. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=570.24s)]
*  This is from April 15th. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=571.24s)]
*  I'm only going to show you a short portion of this clip, but she makes a heartfelt plea [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=573.24s)]
*  to Donald Trump. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=577.32s)]
*  I want my husband back. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=578.6s)]
*  He's the father of our children. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=580.08s)]
*  Abrego Garcia's wife lives in Maryland. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=582.28s)]
*  She and Abrego have three kids together. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=586.36s)]
*  The kids are American citizens. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=588.64s)]
*  Abrego Garcia has no criminal history at all. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=590.8s)]
*  He was given a work permit by the Trump administration in 2019. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=595.56s)]
*  There was a withholding order in 2019 as well saying you can't send him to El Salvador. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=601.68s)]
*  And he's been showing up. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=607.72s)]
*  He works in a union. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=608.88s)]
*  He's been showing up to ICE every year. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=610.68s)]
*  He's a member of the community there. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=612.56s)]
*  I know the Trump regime wants to act like this guy is like Bin Laden, but it would be [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=614.3599999999999s)]
*  like if that's the case. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=618.1999999999999s)]
*  So then you in 2019 Trump gave Bin Laden a work permit and he works at the union and [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=619.8s)]
*  he just shows up and checks in with ICE voluntarily. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=625.12s)]
*  I mean, that's what you're arguing with no criminal history here in the United States. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=629.3199999999999s)]
*  But just so you can hear what Abrego Garcia's wife says here, play this clip. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=633.56s)]
*  Of after his disappearance and I stand before you filled with spirit that refuses to bring [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=637.76s)]
*  down. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=646.8s)]
*  I will not stop fighting until I see my husband alive. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=649.8s)]
*  Kilmer, if you can hear me, stay strong. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=658.56s)]
*  God hasn't forgotten about you. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=664.72s)]
*  Our children are asking when would you come home? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=668.6s)]
*  And I pray for the day I tell them the time and date that you'll return. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=674.1600000000001s)]
*  It seems like you hear about a new round of layoffs every day. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=678.5600000000001s)]
*  So what's the best way to dodge the next round? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=681.34s)]

*  You know, then there's this other aspect too from that interview on ABC where Donald Trump claims [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=780.6800000000001s)]
*  that the MS-13 that that on Abrego's knuckles, it says MS-13 and it doesn't. I mean, Abrego has [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=786.9200000000001s)]
*  tattoos in that area, but then Photoshopped on his hand was the letters MS and the numbers 13. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=796.76s)]
*  That's not actually on his hand, but Donald Trump is saying what he's been told, what he's been [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=805.88s)]
*  given ostensibly by lawyers, he claims is that it says, actually it says MS-13. By the way, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=811.56s)]
*  even if it said MS-13 on it, then you Trump administration one gave this guy a work permit, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=818.28s)]
*  he would still be entitled to due process. And then ultimately, if he was found to be a bad guy, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=824.76s)]
*  then there could be accountability for it. I'm not sure the accountability should be sending [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=829.8s)]
*  a human being to a concentration camp in El Salvador, but we definitely want to see gang [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=834.36s)]
*  members off the street. They can be held accountable and there should be full and complete law and [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=838.52s)]
*  order handled. But just Trump saying that this is what his lawyers told him here. Play this clip [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=842.92s)]
*  right here. He wasn't a member of a gang and then they looked and on his knuckles he had MS-13. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=847.64s)]
*  There's a dispute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. He had MS-13 on his knuckles tattoo. He had some [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=854.2s)]
*  tattoos that are interpreted that way, but let's move on. Wait a minute. I will. Hey, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=859.96s)]
*  Terry, Terry, Terry. He did not have the letter MS-13. It says MS-13. That was Photoshop. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=863.08s)]
*  So let me just- That was Photoshop. Terry, you can't do that. Hey, they're giving you the big [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=870.12s)]
*  break of a lifetime. You're doing the interview. I picked you because frankly, I never heard of [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=874.2s)]
*  you, but that's okay. I picked you, Terry, but you're not being very nice. He had MS-13 tattoo. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=878.6s)]
*  We'll agree to disagree. I want to move on to something else. Terry, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=884.9200000000001s)]
*  do you want me to show you the picture? I saw the picture. We'll agree to disagree. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=887.08s)]
*  And you think it was Photoshop? Here we go. Here we go. Don't Photoshop it. Don't look at his hand. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=891.56s)]
*  He had MS-13. He did have tattoos that can be interpreted that way. I'm not an expert on them. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=895.48s)]
*  I want to turn to Ukraine. No, no. Terry, Terry. I want to get to Ukraine. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=899.48s)]
*  No, no. He had MS as clear as you can be, not interpreted. This is why people no longer believe [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=901.72s)]
*  the news because it's fake news. When he was photographed in El Salvador, they aren't there. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=909.96s)]
*  But let's just go. They aren't there when he's in. Oh, they want to get there now, right? No, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=915.24s)]
*  they're in your picture. Terry, you cranked, sir. He's got MS-13 on his knuckles. Okay. We'll take [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=921.08s)]
*  a look. It's such a disservice. We'll take a look. Why are you just saying yes, he does. And, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=927.64s)]
*  you know, go into something else. He's contested. So now Trump's lawyers have to go in front of [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=933.0s)]
*  these federal judge, the federal judge in Maryland, Judge Zinus. There's a Trump appointed federal [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=939.24s)]
*  judge in Maryland as well in another case involving a 20-year-old Venezuelan who this [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=944.36s)]
*  Trump appointed judge ordered be returned and the same way Abrego Garcia has got to be returned, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=950.84s)]
*  consistent with the Supreme Court's nine to zero order. There's a Trump appointed judge in Louisiana [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=956.76s)]
*  who's saying that the Trump administration sent a two-year-old from a two-year-old United States [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=963.72s)]
*  citizen to Honduras and deported United States citizens. So I guess Trump's plan is to engage [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1Do7wAA_E&t=970.6s)]
