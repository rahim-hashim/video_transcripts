# OMG! MAGA Mike THROWN UNDER BUS in Public by GOP
**MeidasTouch:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w)
*  Uh-oh, not a good day for Speaker MAGA Mike Johnson, who was just thrown under the bus [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=0.0s)]
*  by his own party in a very public letter. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=5.36s)]
*  In contrast, a very good day for House Democrats, who just named a new ranking member to the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=8.44s)]
*  Oversight Committee, who is ready to start aggressively pursuing investigations into [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=14.64s)]
*  Trump and MAGA crimes. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=20.84s)]
*  Let me show you what went down earlier today as MAGA Republicans in the House who claim [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=22.56s)]
*  to be moderate, but we know they're not all that moderate, sent a letter to MAGA Mike [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=28.0s)]
*  Johnson. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=32.440000000000005s)]
*  They then leaked the letter publicly where they excoriate MAGA Mike Johnson and the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=33.440000000000005s)]
*  majority leader in the Senate, Majority Leader Thune, a MAGA Republican, for making the disastrous [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=38.88s)]
*  budget bill even a bigger disaster and having this murder bill kill even more people. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  And we already know the murder bill, which they call a big, beautiful bill. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  They say murder bill is deeply, deeply unpopular among the American people. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=56.32s)]
*  So here's what's being reported. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=61.72s)]
*  Sixteen House Republicans write a letter rebelling against the Senate bill's Medicaid spending [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=63.28s)]
*  cuts. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  But this was all part of MAGA Mike Johnson's plan. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  It's all part of his and Donald Trump's fraud. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=72.4s)]
*  Convince the so-called moderate MAGA Republicans in the House to support the budget bill, then [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=75.12s)]
*  send it over to the Senate to make it even a worse budget bill and then call upon Donald [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=81.6s)]
*  Trump to threaten and extort the MAGA House members to support it at the last minute under [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=87.08s)]
*  the threat that they're going to be primaried. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=93.08s)]
*  Let's keep reading this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=96.32s)]
*  The cuts to Medicaid by the Senate version of the disastrous budget bill are, quote, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=98.24s)]
*  more aggressive than the House bill. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=103.96s)]
*  And by more aggressive, that means kills more people. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=106.08s)]
*  Cuts to emergency Medicaid funding. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=109.76s)]
*  Let's take a look at this letter that was sent by these 16 House Republicans to Senate [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=116.76s)]
*  Majority Leader Thune and to MAGA Mike Johnson. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=122.28s)]
*  They write the following. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  As members of Congress who help secure a Republican majority, we believe that it is essential [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  that the final reconciliation bill, that's referring to the disastrous budget bill, reflect [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=132.16s)]
*  the priorities of our constituents. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=137.16s)]
*  Most importantly, the critical need to protect Medicaid and the hospitals that serve our [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=139.44s)]
*  communities throughout the budget process. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=144.76s)]
*  We have consistently affirmed our commitment to ensuring that reductions in federal spending [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=147.04s)]
*  do not come at the expense of our most vulnerable constituents. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  We write to reiterate that commitment to those we represent here in Washington. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=156.64s)]
*  Oh, so you want to leak this publicly to pretend that you care about your constituents that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=161.12s)]
*  you're killing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=166.4s)]
*  The letter goes on to say, from these MAGA Republicans to MAGA Mike Johnson and the MAGA [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=167.88s)]
*  Republican leader of the Senate Thune, it goes on to say, we support the Medicaid reforms [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=172.16s)]
*  in H.R.1, that's the House version, which strengthen the program's ability to serve [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=177.72s)]
*  children, pregnant women, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=183.12s)]
*  The proposal released by the Senate Finance Committee on June 16 includes provisions that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=187.38s)]
*  go beyond H.R.1. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=192.36s)]
*  The House approach reflects a more pragmatic and compassionate standard, and we urge that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=194.68s)]
*  it be retained in the final bill. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=199.6s)]
*  The Senate proposal also undermines the balanced approach taken to craft the Medicaid provisions [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=201.8s)]
*  in H.R.1, particularly regarding provider taxes and state-directed payments. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=206.44s)]
*  The Senate version treats expansion and non-expansion states unfairly, fails to preserve existing [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  state programs, and imposes stricter limits that do not give hospitals sufficient time [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  to adjust to new budgetary constraints or identify alternative funding sources. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  In other words, hospitals lose funding and people die immediately. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  That's what that word salad meant right there. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  This letter from the MAGA Republicans to MAGA Mike Johnson and Senate leader Thune say the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=235.3s)]
*  following, we are also concerned about rushed implementation of timelines, penalties for [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  expansion states, changes to the community engagement requirements for adults with dependents, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=245.28s)]
*  and cuts to emergency Medicaid funding. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=251.52s)]
*  These changes would place additional burdens on hospitals already stretched thin by legal [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=254.56s)]
*  and moral obligations to provide care. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=260.44s)]
*  Folks, that's why we call this disastrous budget bill a murder bill, because it kills [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=263.28s)]
*  people. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=269.28s)]
*  The Senate version does even a worse job than the House budget bill does with even more [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=270.28s)]
*  people getting killed. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=276.91999999999996s)]
*  So here's MAGA Mike Johnson, though, after getting that letter, and MAGA Mike Johnson [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=278.96s)]
*  brazenly lies and he goes, no, we're not cutting Medicaid. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=283.2s)]
*  The president says. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=287.23999999999995s)]
*  The president says that we're not. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=288.4s)]
*  Yeah, maybe when you start a sentence with the president says and you're referring to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=289.84s)]
*  Donald Trump, unfortunately, we know it's going to be a lie. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  The guy is a fraud. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=296.94s)]
*  The guy is a felon. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=298.28s)]
*  The guy is a sexual abuser. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=299.52s)]
*  The guy is a bankrupt or how do you know Donald Trump is lying? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=301.28s)]
*  He opens up his mouth. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=304.4s)]
*  All this guy does is fraud and lie and fraud and lie. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=305.96s)]
*  Here's what MAGA Mike Johnson says, though, play this clip. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=310.38s)]
*  You've got a number of provisions. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=312.88s)]
*  We want to make sure that we hold by our commitment that we are not cutting Medicaid. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=314.76s)]
*  President has said that and I've said that we've all said that we are strengthening the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=319.78s)]
*  program for the people who are the most vulnerable populations who really rely upon that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  You're talking about the disabled, the elderly, young pregnant women, for example. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=327.08s)]
*  Those resources won't be available for those people who desperately needed and deserve [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=331.84s)]
*  it if young able bodied men, for example, are on the program and not working. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=336.28s)]
*  So we introduced a work requirement on the House side. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=340.56s)]
*  It's wildly popular with the people because it follows common sense. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=343.08s)]
*  If you're going to be on the public wagon and you're able, you should try to help pull [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=346.32s)]
*  it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=349.52s)]
*  And all we did was put in there, as you all know, a 20 hour work requirement per week, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=350.52s)]
*  20 hours. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=354.24s)]
*  You guys work 80 hours, I'm sure. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=355.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  They're complaining about that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  You either have to be working. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  You have to be looking for a job and a job training program or volunteering in a community [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  for heaven's sakes. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=365.0s)]
*  Do something constructive. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=366.0s)]
*  That is that is something that everybody nods their head in agreement at a town hall and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=367.88s)]
*  says, yes, do that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=371.48s)]
*  Why didn't we do it already? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=372.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=373.48s)]
*  So what we've done strengthen the program. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=374.48s)]
*  I hope and believe I pray that the Senate will follow that same theme and not do anything [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=376.2s)]
*  that we couldn't pass on the other side over here. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=381.22s)]
*  And how do you trust a word that Maga Mike Johnson says? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=384.12s)]
*  Who's just Donald Trump's stooge? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=387.44s)]
*  And Maga Mike Johnson doesn't even believe that the Congress should have any role at [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=389.48s)]
*  all, that he believes it should just be a puppet of the regime. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=395.68s)]
*  That's what they view. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  Listen to him say right here. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  Maga Mike Johnson is arguing that constitutional experts say that the House of Representatives [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=402.2s)]
*  should have nothing at all to do in the Congress in general, should have nothing to do with [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=409.48s)]
*  war powers. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=415.6s)]
*  It's literally Article 1, Section 8. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  It's literally it's there. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=420.36s)]
*  It is your authority. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=421.68s)]
*  But Maga Mike goes, no, no, no. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=423.26s)]
*  Why why should we have any say over the war powers? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=424.68s)]
*  That's for dictator Donald. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=427.34000000000003s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  It also requires that the president inform Congress within 48 hours of use of military [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=430.0s)]
*  force. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=434.12s)]
*  Obviously, President Trump did that. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=435.12s)]
*  Obviously, in the modern era with the 24 hour news cycle and social media, nothing goes [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=436.96s)]
*  by unnoticed. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=440.76s)]
*  This might have made some sense in 1973, but I'm not even sure it was constitutional. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=443.0s)]
*  And I'll tell you about that as well. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=446.76s)]
*  Many respected constitutional experts argue that the War Powers Act is itself unconstitutional. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=448.96s)]
*  I'm persuaded by that argument. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=456.32s)]
*  They think it's a violation of the Article 2 powers of the Commander in Chief. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=458.1s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=461.38s)]
*  If you look back at the founders intent, you read the Federalist Papers, you read the records [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=462.44s)]
*  of the Constitutional Convention. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=465.58s)]
*  I think that is right. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=468.53999999999996s)]
*  And many more scholars believe the president is correct to use this executive authority [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=470.41999999999996s)]
*  in exactly the manner that he did over the weekend. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=474.53999999999996s)]
*  I am a jealous guardian of Congress's Article 1 authority. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=478.06s)]
*  We are the defenders of it here, and we take it seriously. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=482.26s)]
*  And I always will be. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=485.14s)]
*  But exercising the authority to declare war isn't something we've done since World War [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=486.91999999999996s)]
*  II. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=491.26s)]
*  And everybody in this room knows since then we've had more than 125 military operations [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=492.38s)]
*  from Korea and Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=498.21999999999997s)]
*  They have occurred without a declaration of war by Congress. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=501.58s)]
*  Presidents of both parties have exercised that authority frequently. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=505.86s)]
*  And then after Donald Trump claiming that he obliterated, obliterated all of the nuclear [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=511.26s)]
*  Iran, Mike Johnson goes on Fox and says, we're under no illusions that you can just kill [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=518.72s)]
*  all nuclear ambitions overnight. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=525.24s)]
*  Wasn't that the claim here? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=528.8000000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=529.8000000000001s)]
*  After we crash them, I just tell you that right now, Mr. Speaker, Reuters is reporting Iran's [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=530.8000000000001s)]
*  nuclear chief says we're going to immediately start reconstituting our nuclear program. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=537.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's how you negotiate. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=542.12s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=544.1600000000001s)]
*  This madness. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=547.28s)]
*  I mean, we're under no illusion that you can just kill all their nuclear ambition overnight. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=548.28s)]
*  But I think reality has set in over there. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=552.76s)]
*  We have decimated the upper echelon of their military command as well as their nuclear [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=554.86s)]
*  scientists. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=559.72s)]
*  I mean, there's not much left for them to rebuild upon. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=560.72s)]
*  But the idea that they would put out a statement like that at this fragile moment is very frustrating [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  and straight off the post victory win, the ranking member of the House of the Oversight [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=568.72s)]
*  Committee. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=575.44s)]
*  Congressman Robert Garcia, Democrat, Congressman Garcia, first off, congratulations on the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=576.44s)]
*  victory. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=582.12s)]
*  Now, the ranking member of the Oversight Committee for the Democrats. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=583.12s)]
*  I was just showing a bunch of clips right there before about Maga Mike Johnson and what [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=587.36s)]
*  he's trying to pull. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=592.36s)]
*  But let's talk more about what the Democrats are doing for moving the agenda forward and [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=593.6400000000001s)]
*  specifically what you're going to be doing now as the ranking member of the Oversight [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=597.96s)]
*  Committee. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=602.98s)]
*  Still in the minority, but what are you going to do? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=604.14s)]
*  Well, look, first, I'm very grateful, of course, to the House Democratic Caucus just winning [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=607.4200000000001s)]
*  the election. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=612.14s)]
*  As you all know, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is at the heart of keeping [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=613.14s)]
*  Congress working for the American public. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=618.7s)]
*  It's about investigations. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=621.34s)]
*  It's about taking on corruption. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=622.34s)]
*  It's about investigating those that are in power that are trying to damage the public [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=624.38s)]
*  and our institutions. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=629.0600000000001s)]
*  At the same time, it's about government reform. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=630.0600000000001s)]
*  How do we make government actually work for the public? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=632.58s)]
*  How do we actually make it more efficient? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=635.74s)]
*  How do we actually transform government to support the workforce? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=637.14s)]
*  That's what oversight is. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=640.86s)]
*  As we know, oversight has always been that committee that is investigating corruption. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=641.9000000000001s)]
*  And so it's been an honor to work with Jerry Connolly. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=648.7800000000001s)]
*  Obviously, Jamie Raskin was one of my heroes coming into Congress. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=651.62s)]
*  And to be able to take on this role as the lead Democrat in this committee, we are going [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=655.38s)]
*  to hold Donald Trump and his administration accountable. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=660.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm grateful for the support and I'm happy to be here with you. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=663.82s)]
*  I think a lot of people saw how the MAGA Republicans turned the Oversight Committee, which as you [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=667.86s)]
*  just noted is incredibly important to root out corruption. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=673.4200000000001s)]
*  They used it as the source of corruption and as an enabler of corruption. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=678.3000000000001s)]
*  And we've seen what people like James Comer and other people have done, how they've literally [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=683.86s)]
*  used fake whistleblowers, how they've basically just been a tool of the Trump regime to go [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=689.1s)]
*  after Trump's political enemy. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=694.6999999999999s)]
*  So how do you right now with the Democrats still not controlling the House, how do you [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=696.54s)]
*  push back on that at this stage? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=702.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, first, we've got to call out their lies and their corruption every single day. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=704.02s)]
*  Remember, this is a committee that has Marjorie Taylor Greene and Nancy Mace and James Comer [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=709.5s)]
*  and Jim Jordan and Lauren Boebert. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=715.3s)]
*  And so many of the MAGA extremists that are lying to the American public and doing nothing [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=718.6999999999999s)]
*  to address the concerns of the American people. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=724.26s)]
*  And so it's really important for us as a committee to get together, lay out an agenda and not [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=727.86s)]
*  only at the end of the day, push back on the lies, but also do our own investigative work. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=732.98s)]
*  We've got to investigate the corruption of the government, take on and push back on Doge, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=738.98s)]
*  ensure that Elon Musk has held accountable for everything that he did to try to harm [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=742.8199999999999s)]
*  the American public and the government and the large corporations that are trying to [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=746.82s)]
*  rip off the American taxpayer and do nothing to lower the cost of goods. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=750.34s)]
*  That also has to be addressed. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=754.82s)]
*  And while we do all that, we're going to work with our partners and people across this country [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=756.6600000000001s)]
*  to look at our agencies, to actually see how we can make them work better for the American [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=761.3000000000001s)]
*  people. And so I'm really excited about this opportunity. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=766.58s)]
*  And I'm grateful. Look, as you know, I'm in my 30 year in Congress and to be elected to be [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=769.38s)]
*  a ranking member this early and being in Congress, I know is unique typically in Congress, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=774.9s)]
*  but I'm just grateful that they were able to see that we had not just the experience, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=781.86s)]
*  particularly serving as mayor of a big city, but that we're able to expand the tent, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=785.78s)]
*  bring some more folks in, bring newer voices, new generation of Democrats to be a part of [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=790.42s)]
*  the solution, be a part of winning the House back. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=795.4599999999999s)]
*  And we're going to do everything we can to take on Donald Trump. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=797.86s)]
*  And I'm really excited about it. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=800.74s)]
*  You know, that's what I'm hearing from all of our viewers here at the MidasTouch Network. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=802.34s)]
*  They were so happy to hear that you won because it also represents, you know, I think a shift [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=807.1400000000001s)]
*  right now as well to younger generation, you know, of people rolling up their sleeves, you know, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=812.98s)]
*  fighting fire with fire and really kind of pushing back. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=820.34s)]
*  I think people are just done of seeing, you know, Donald Trump, you know, and the Magna machine just [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=823.94s)]
*  throw everything against the wall and kind of sees what sticks while, you know, Democrats are [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=830.74s)]
*  playing, you know, you know, polite. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=836.5s)]
*  Oh, maybe we try to look, maybe we try to do that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=838.66s)]
*  Let's listen to that. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=840.98s)]
*  And so how do we fight right now? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=841.86s)]
*  I mean, how do we looking forward, what are going to be some of the biggest priorities? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=844.1800000000001s)]
*  How do we fight and push back? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=847.94s)]
*  Well, look, I try to be fearless in the work. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=849.38s)]
*  We know that this is a moment where our country is in danger, our democracy is under attack, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=852.02s)]
*  and we've got to fight like hell. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=855.86s)]
*  Our constituents, the country is not only demanding it, it's necessary to protect our democracy. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=858.26s)]
*  You all know that, you know, we pushed back. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=864.66s)]
*  In fact, I had Donald Trump, as you know, try to investigate me for criticizing Elon Musk just a [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=867.22s)]
*  few months ago. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=871.86s)]
*  We've taken on Marjorie Taylor Greene and Nancy Mace and their lives in this committee. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=873.62s)]
*  And we've a talented group of House Democrats that are on the Oversight Committee. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=877.6999999999999s)]
*  This is a committee, of course, that that Alexandra Costa Cortez and Katie Porter and [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=882.66s)]
*  so many others are used to take on corruption. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=887.38s)]
*  And I think that I look at the new members that are on this committee, the freshmen, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=890.58s)]
*  the senior members that have so much wisdom and mentorship to get to the rest of us. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=894.74s)]
*  And we've got an all star team. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=898.26s)]
*  This is the team that is going to ensure that we hold the administration accountable. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=899.7s)]
*  This is the team that's going to ensure that we make government work better for the American [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=905.06s)]
*  people. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=909.14s)]
*  And so I'm going to be going across, not just in the committee room, but we'll go across [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=909.78s)]
*  the country. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=914.34s)]
*  We're going to have field hearings. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=914.82s)]
*  We're going to do all sorts of ways to reach out to the public and remind folks that we've [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=915.86s)]
*  got a country worth fighting for and that Donald Trump is the worst person to ever serve [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=920.5s)]
*  as president. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=925.22s)]
*  And we remind the American public of that. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=925.94s)]
*  You feel reason for hope right now. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=928.5s)]
*  We saw the Big No Kings protests, it seems. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=930.42s)]
*  I mean, and you and I have been speaking since you got into Congress, but we've we've had [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=933.54s)]
*  our highs, we've had our lows. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=937.7s)]
*  And there was that moment after Trump was elected where I think a lot of people were [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=939.46s)]
*  down. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=944.34s)]
*  We weren't sure how it was going to go. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=945.14s)]
*  You and others kept on fighting. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=946.58s)]
*  We tried to do our part here. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=948.02s)]
*  How do you feel right now? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=949.62s)]
*  June 24th, 2025? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=951.54s)]
*  I do feel hopeful. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=954.18s)]
*  I mean, look, let's be let's be clear. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=955.3s)]
*  I mean, this is a very difficult time for the country and the world. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=957.06s)]
*  A lot of horrible things are happening, but there is, I think, a fire burning within the [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=960.74s)]
*  American public. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=965.3s)]
*  They're pushing back against Donald Trump. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=966.5s)]
*  They're pushing back against Elon Musk. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=968.1s)]
*  They're organizing. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=970.1s)]
*  They're peacefully protesting. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=971.46s)]
*  They're out on the streets demanding a better country and better actions from our government. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=972.74s)]
*  And when I see those those recent rallies and then the No Kings marches and activities [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=977.78s)]
*  all across the country, it does give you hope. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=983.7s)]
*  And I think we're going to continue to see that happening in the weeks and months ahead. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=986.74s)]
*  And then the American public have to sustain that energy because as we know, Donald Trump [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=991.38s)]
*  is right now working on enriching himself and his family. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=996.82s)]
*  He's accepting 400 million dollar planes. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=1000.02s)]
*  He's creating mean coins so he can essentially funnel foreign money into his family's pockets. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=1002.1s)]
*  He's opening up hotels across the world in countries where we should be doing diplomacy. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=1006.26s)]
*  These are not just illegal. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=1012.02s)]
*  They're against the Constitution. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=1014.34s)]
*  And so we've got to make sure that we hold him and his family accountable for the crimes [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=1016.1800000000001s)]
*  that they are committing and remind the American public what they're actually doing. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=1021.14s)]
*  That's going to be our job on the Oversight Committee. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=1025.22s)]
*  And your viewers, the American public, can rest assured that we're going to work every [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=1028.1s)]
*  single day to hold these folks accountable and to make their lives better. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=1032.66s)]
*  Congressman Robert Garcia, we're grateful for you picking independent media and the [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvfu1Cgn1w&t=1038.18s)]
