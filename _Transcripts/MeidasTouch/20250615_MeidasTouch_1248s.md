# Trump’s DARK PAST is EXPOSED by Protestors WHO REMEMBER
**MeidasTouch:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM)
*  Donald Trump and his regime can try every distraction that they want, but it ain't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=0.0s)]
*  working on the people. At the No Kings protest, I saw a lot of signs of people asking the right [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=5.28s)]
*  types of questions right now and putting this issue front and center. Donald Trump's disgusting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=12.72s)]
*  predatory past. Donald Trump the sexual abuser. Donald Trump the felon. Donald Trump the bankruptor. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=19.6s)]
*  Donald Trump Epstein's close friend who said Epstein was a great guy. Signs like this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=27.6s)]
*  Stand by your man. A photo of Donald Trump clubbing and partying with Epstein. A sign like this. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=34.56s)]
*  Trump killed Epstein. You're next. That's what that sign says. That's not what I'm saying, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  but that's what that sign says. Or how about Daniel who goes, do you like my protest sign? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=47.6s)]
*  It says, Gulf of Donald J. Trump was friends with Jeffrey Epstein for 25 years. I like that sign, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=54.24s)]
*  Daniel. How about this sign right here? Trump partying with Epstein. Sick, simple, tyrant. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=62.24s)]
*  Or this sign. Release the Epstein files. Phase two. Just release the files. Remember what they [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=70.48s)]
*  said phase one where they had all those right-wing influencers, what, four months ago at this point, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=77.44s)]
*  hold up the binders and said, we got it. Here are the files. And it was actually just Epstein's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=83.28s)]
*  call list. And Donald Trump's name was actually on it. And that was released several years ago. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=91.68s)]
*  We know Donald Trump's name is on the Epstein files and the list based on the files and the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=99.44s)]
*  lists that had been previously released in other court cases. But we want to see the whole files [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=104.48s)]
*  because Donald Trump is Doe 172 in that. I want to see what Doe 172 was up to. Don't you? I want [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=112.24s)]
*  to see what was going down at Mar-a-Lago because we know Virginia Joufray, for example, who [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=121.36s)]
*  unalived herself recently. She died by suicide in Australia. She was an underage girl. She was [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  previously homeless, somehow got a job at Mar-a-Lago, and she was recruited there by Epstein [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=137.2s)]
*  through Ghislaine Maxwell, who went there, brought her to Epstein from Mar-a-Lago. And then Donald [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  Trump at the sex trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell wished her well at that same sex trafficking [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  criminal trial. A woman, someone who's now a woman at the time, was an underage girl, was 14 years [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=156.16s)]
*  old, said that she was introduced to Trump by Epstein when she was a 14 year old girl. Release [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=164.16s)]
*  the damn files. Donald Trump is all over Epstein's flight log based on what's been released, all over [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=172.64s)]
*  deposition transcripts of what's been released. Epstein was on Trump's plane before. We know that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=178.56s)]
*  Release the damn files. Here's another sign right here. Give no cover to convicts. Trump [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=185.28s)]
*  partying with Epstein. More signs. Release the Epstein list. I saw a ton of signs like this when [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=192.64s)]
*  I was at the protest here in Pasadena. What's really interesting and really telling as well [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=199.2s)]
*  are those right-wing podcasters who Donald Trump has now made the head of his FBI, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=205.76s)]
*  and the deputy FBI director, Cash Patel and Dan Bongino respectively. They were like some of the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=212.72s)]
*  top purveyors of the release the Epstein list. We're going to get the Epstein list. So interesting [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=220.56s)]
*  that the people who were saying release the list, that we need to get this out there, were made by [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=226.4s)]
*  Donald Trump to be the freaking head of the FBI. And when they were positioned there, they're now [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=233.28s)]
*  saying that they're not going to release it, or it's just going to take some time and it's not [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=242.08s)]
*  being released. They want to distract us and they think this is just going to go away, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=247.6s)]
*  or they're trying to redact and hide information. The New York Times finally did a story on it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=253.04s)]
*  Once champions of fringe causes, just say it, Trump's friendship with Epstein and more than that, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=259.28s)]
*  now in a trap of their own making, the top leaders at the Justice Department and FBI [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=265.6s)]
*  are struggling to fulfill Trump campaign promises often rooted in misinformation and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=271.44s)]
*  conspiracy theories. It's a weird way of framing it. Just release the freaking Epstein files. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=276.72s)]
*  You said you were going to release it. So remember what? It's the end of last week or middle of last [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=280.88000000000005s)]
*  week when you had Cash Patel go on Joe Rogan and said, you know what, there's not a lot of footage [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  actually on the Epstein Island, not a lot of footage. And then he tries to act like we don't [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=294.56s)]
*  want to release this stuff because we don't want to re-victimize the people. That's why we don't [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=300.16s)]
*  want to release it. Here's what he says here. Play this clip. The narrative has always been [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=305.12s)]
*  that there's video, but what about the video from the island? Again, we're going to give you [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=309.92s)]
*  everything we can and people have to remember we're not going to re-victimize [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  women. We're not going to put that shit back out there. It's not happening because then he wins, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=321.76s)]
*  not doing it. You want to hate me for it? Fine. Again, logical play out. If there was a video [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=325.92s)]
*  of some guy or gal committing felonies on an island and I'm in charge, don't you think you'd [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=333.28s)]
*  see it? Right. If you have it. Right. But you can't say that you have it. No, we're giving you [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=341.52s)]
*  everything we have. And is there video from the island? Not of what you want. So this narrative [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  might not be accurate that there's video of these guys doing this. Exactly. Have you guys reviewed [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=355.68s)]
*  everything that you have? Almost. I mean, yes, we have and now we're figuring out how to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=361.6s)]
*  right. Put it out. But is there footage? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=369.12s)]
*  If there was ever, if there was footage of anyone doing anything else, we would have opened a case. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=375.04s)]
*  There are tens of thousands of videos. Yeah. And it's all but little hints. If there was a video [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=379.92s)]
*  of some guy or gal committing felonies on an island and I'm in charge, don't you think you'd [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  see it? But remember when Donald Trump about a year ago regarding the Epstein files, Trump said [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=395.28s)]
*  a year ago that he would not release them. So remember what he said during this interview here, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  play this clip. Would you declassify the Epstein files? Yeah. Yeah, I would. All right. Yes, I would. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=408.64s)]
*  I think that less so because, you know, you don't know. You don't want to affect people's lives if [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=414.96s)]
*  it's phony stuff in there because there's a lot of phony stuff with that whole world. But I think I [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  would or at least. Do you think that would restore trust? Help restore trust? I don't know about [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=425.35999999999996s)]
*  Epstein so much as I do the others. Certainly about the way he died. It would be interesting [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=429.35999999999996s)]
*  to find out what happened there because that was a weird situation and the cameras didn't happen to [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=433.35999999999996s)]
*  be working, et cetera, et cetera. But you had to go a long way toward that one. The other stuff I [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=437.44s)]
*  would now. Annapolina Luna, who literally she's like as mag as you get, she's as trumped up as [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=442.08s)]
*  you get. She has a whole task force in Congress of release the Epstein files. That's like her [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=448.96s)]
*  subcommittee. She's like the Epstein subcommittee. Here's what she had to say on April 8th. Play this [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=456.32s)]
*  clip. The one thing I've been very frustrated with, Matt, is that I have tried very hard to [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=461.68s)]
*  obtain the Jeffrey Epstein files. I have been contacting the Department of Justice. I've even [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=466.0s)]
*  chased down the FBI and I keep getting the same thing. We are reviewing documents. I don't believe [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=470.72s)]
*  that the process has been as good as the JFK rollout and the MLK and RFK rollout will be. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=477.36s)]
*  And so I'm going to continue to put pressure on the DOJ to release that information. Look, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=483.68s)]
*  there's bad people that are haven't been charged for doing really horrible things with underage [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=487.92s)]
*  people. And frankly, as the DOJ given you any timeline on that, Ana? No. In fact, I haven't [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=492.08000000000004s)]
*  really gotten any communication from the DOJ. And here's what she had to say on March 1st, 2025. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=498.4s)]
*  Play this clip. What's going on with the Epstein files, Congresswoman? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=503.28s)]
*  Well, you know, I'm really actually happy that you asked that question. So I was tasked with the task [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=508.64s)]
*  force on declassification to look forward and investigate the files once they are released from [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=514.24s)]
*  the attorney general's office. Now I want to be clear about something. What we found in the last [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=519.84s)]
*  couple of weeks and what's definitely apparent is there's absolutely a war taking place in the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=524.72s)]
*  intelligence agencies, right? We saw the CIA was reporting that they're worried about their own [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  people leaking secrets to foreign countries. And we were also notified last week that there was a [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=533.76s)]
*  whistleblower that came forward stating that there was evidence being destroyed at the FBI. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=538.4s)]
*  As soon as the FBI found out President Trump won the election, they started their deep state nonsense. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=543.0400000000001s)]
*  And so I have full faith in Kash Patel and AG Bondi to deliver those files. But I want to be [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=547.2s)]
*  very clear about something. The American people want the truth. We don't want redactions. And [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=553.04s)]
*  although we are same team, I'm going to continue to press for that transparency because that is [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=557.68s)]
*  exactly what the American people asked for when they elected President Trump. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=562.0s)]
*  Good. This episode is brought to you by IQ Bar, our exclusive snack sponsor. IQ Bar is the better [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=565.52s)]

*  influencers kind of make the excuses for Donald Trump. Like here's what Hannity said. Let's play. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=660.72s)]
*  Today the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, released phase one of the Epstein files. That's transparency. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=665.84s)]
*  There are a lot of names in there. And Epstein was obviously a star chaser who wanted to hang out [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=671.52s)]
*  with people that are famous, people with money. So let me be very clear at the start here. And I said [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=677.84s)]
*  this on my radio show today. People, because they're in the Rolodex, they're on the list, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=682.1600000000001s)]
*  does not mean they did anything wrong. On this show, and we have done it over and over again, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=686.48s)]
*  we don't rush to judgment. We believe in the presumption of innocence. And I am appealing to [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=692.32s)]
*  people not to rush to judgment. Even though these names are now public information, there are names [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=698.16s)]
*  that I'm certain were not involved or knowledgeable. I could be certain of it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=703.6800000000001s)]
*  Among the documents are flight logs in which President Donald Trump is named several times. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  According to the records, Trump flew on Epstein's private jets repeatedly back in the 1990s. Now, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=712.64s)]
*  this isn't new information as it had previously been made public. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=718.8s)]
*  And here's what Charlie Kirk had to say. Let's play it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=725.5999999999999s)]
*  Now, 10 years later, we're supposed to believe there's going to be a smoking gun [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=728.0799999999999s)]
*  of something in the Epstein files. But what is in the Epstein files is yes, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=731.8399999999999s)]
*  President Donald Trump is probably mentioned. He was mentioned in the Epstein file dump back [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=736.4s)]
*  in February. You know why he lived in Palm Beach? There's probably thousands of names in the Epstein [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=740.3199999999999s)]
*  files. Was he part of the Epstein client list? Absolutely not. That is complete nonsense. But [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=746.08s)]
*  to say that Donald Trump is not releasing the Epstein files because he's in them in some [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=752.0s)]
*  incriminating way. Yes, it's very clear that if you live in Palm Beach, you might have been [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=758.4000000000001s)]
*  mentioned and caught up in some sort of conversation with Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=764.64s)]
*  Let's go back to last year, Democratic lawmakers, Ted Lieu, Democratic Congress member Ted Lieu. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=769.0400000000001s)]
*  Here's what he said last year. Play the clip. So like Chairman Aguilar said, we hear a lot [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=777.44s)]
*  from our constituents on different issues. But something I've heard that doesn't seem to be [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=784.1600000000001s)]
*  being covered are the Epstein files. These files were released. And like Donald Trump sort of all [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=788.0s)]
*  over this, right? There are pictures of him with Jeffrey Epstein. He's taken multiple plane flights [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=794.56s)]
*  with Epstein with young girls on board. He is on call logs with Epstein. One of the highest [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=798.9599999999999s)]
*  training hashtags on Twitter right now is about Trump and Epstein. I'm not going to repeat the [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=804.88s)]
*  hashtag because we're in a dignified setting. But yeah, y'all might want to look at that because [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=808.9599999999999s)]
*  that's highly disturbing. And again, it shows that Donald Trump is unfit for office. And by the way, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=813.4399999999999s)]
*  he was convicted in a civilian court for sexual assault, convicted in a separate court of 34 [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=818.4799999999999s)]
*  felonies. Donald Trump should drop out of the race. Here's what Democratic Congress member [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=824.16s)]
*  Moskowitz said last year. Let's play that clip. And so again, because the gentle lady from from [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=829.52s)]
*  the gentle lady from Georgia, I know is such an advocate for women's rights, as she mentioned, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=837.12s)]
*  and is so concerned about grooming. And apparently we don't have any standards here anymore. Again, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=845.1999999999999s)]
*  I just want to remind, remind my colleagues, because, you know, I don't want them to forget [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=851.84s)]
*  about hypocrisy. Okay, I don't want them to forget about hypocrisy. But you know, Donald Trump was [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=858.48s)]
*  asked about Jeffrey Epstein. And when he was asked, he said, you know, Jeffrey likes him young. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=865.52s)]
*  How did the president know that? How did he know that Jeffrey Epstein likes him young? Perhaps some [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=870.4s)]
*  people are saying he was there since you're so concerned, right? But again, again, I bring this [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=877.36s)]
*  up not, not to make jest, I bring it up. I bring it up. I thought we weren't gonna interrupt. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=885.36s)]
*  We're gonna stop the clock. We did this with Miss Green. State your point. Yeah, I'm just curious [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=892.8000000000001s)]
*  about the impugning of the former president's character that we don't have to do that. He does [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=898.0s)]
*  that himself. Have we basically thrown that rule out? I'm just curious. Or are we gonna follow that? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=903.36s)]
*  Would you accept a pornographic photo? Of Bill Clinton? Yeah, we suspended the rule to [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=911.04s)]
*  the current president, but we didn't suspend it to the former president. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=918.08s)]
*  By the way, please, so you're making the point that we can disparage Joe Biden, but not Donald Trump. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=922.8000000000001s)]
*  Please make that point to the American people. Please. Bill Clinton's not running for office. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=926.72s)]
*  That's my point. And look, this is the footage. I mean, here's Donald Trump partying with Epstein. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=937.28s)]
*  I mean, we know they partied together, like, and more than that. Here, play this clip. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=941.44s)]
*  You're gonna get great ratings on your show. Trump is surrounded by women as music glares in the [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=946.0s)]
*  background. After a while, Trump goes to greet three new guests, among them the financier Jeffrey [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=951.36s)]
*  Epstein. More than a decade before his guilty plea on state prostitution charges. Later in the footage, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=958.9599999999999s)]
*  Trump is seen talking to Epstein and another man as women are dancing in front of them. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=966.64s)]
*  Trump alternates between dancing and pointing out women to Epstein and the other men [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=971.8399999999999s)]
*  and telling Epstein about the cameras. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=976.88s)]
*  Though exactly what they say is difficult to understand as they discuss the women [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=980.88s)]
*  and their appearances, Trump gestures to one and appears to say to Epstein, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=985.5999999999999s)]
*  look at her back there. She's hot. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=991.3599999999999s)]
*  And then Trump says something else into Epstein's ear that makes him double over with laughter. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=996.3199999999999s)]
*  But as the president says now, he never liked Epstein. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1003.4399999999999s)]
*  Our friend, congress member, Eric Swalwell makes a great point right here. He goes, Trump's the most [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1008.16s)]
*  litigious guy. He sues everyone for everything, but he doesn't sue Elon Musk for saying that he's on [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1012.96s)]
*  the Epstein list. He doesn't sue Elon for that or go after Elon for that. Trump just takes it. Here, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1021.04s)]
*  play this clip. Elon's been making a lot of vile threats against Trump. Some he's deleted, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1027.68s)]
*  some he hasn't. He's talked whimsically about maybe sorting out a new party. But say for argument [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1032.24s)]
*  sake, he wanted to come back to the Democrats where he originally was a supporter of the [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1038.64s)]
*  Democrats. And all the people that seem to hate Musk most in America right now used to love him. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1042.88s)]
*  Would you welcome him back with open arms, Elon Musk, if he decided to go back to where he was [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1048.8s)]
*  originally politically? What I welcome right now, and I encourage others to welcome, is his honest [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1055.44s)]
*  criticism of Donald Trump. We were right to oppose Doge cuts that fired cancer scientists or reduced [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1060.88s)]
*  air traffic controllers. But it's wrong if anybody wants to shut him down as he is honestly bringing [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1069.5200000000002s)]
*  to light some of the corruption he saw at the White House. In fact, there's probably no one in [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1075.3600000000001s)]
*  the world who lost more money in a single day than Elon Musk for what he said about Donald Trump. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1081.0400000000002s)]
*  And what I say to the Epstein allegation that he made is Donald Trump is the most litigious person [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1087.28s)]
*  who's ever walked the search. If Elon Musk tweeted at me and said that I was in the Epstein files, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1092.0s)]
*  he would have a lawsuit on his desk within an hour. The fact that Donald Trump, the most litigious [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1097.3600000000001s)]
*  person in the world, has not yet sued Elon Musk for defamation is very, very telling and very alarming [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1103.1200000000001s)]
*  and a signal to Democrats that we need to understand at the Department of Justice what exactly has [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1110.56s)]
*  Donald Trump ordered them to conceal from the American people. But then Annapallina Luna, who's [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1115.36s)]
*  on the Epstein task force, she posts the following. This is what she posted yesterday. Happy birthday [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1120.8799999999999s)]
*  to the greatest president of my lifetime. America's lucky and blessed to have this man leading [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1127.36s)]
*  our great nation. And then she tries to spread a conspiracy that Vance Bolter, the assassin who [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1132.8799999999999s)]
*  killed the Democratic state representative and tried to kill the Democratic state senator, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1141.04s)]
*  and had a list where he tried to kill all these Democratic politicians and all these pro-choice [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1149.52s)]
*  people and all these Democratic people and had a no-kings sign because he was going to try to [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1156.72s)]
*  potentially kill people at the no-kings protest. Annapallina Luna acts like this guy's a Democrat [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1161.68s)]
*  and she tries to spread that, that this guy was out there and, oh, he's Governor Tim Walz's friend. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1168.4s)]
*  All the misinformation that came from the right wing because this guy was on a holdover, this [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1177.6000000000001s)]
*  Vance, this murdering guy, this murderer assassin, Vance Bolter, he was on a committee that was [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1182.72s)]
*  previously in the Republican administration with dozens of people on it that just rolled over into [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1189.8400000000001s)]
*  the Walz administration. They tried to act like, oh, this was like Walz's friend when that's not [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1195.52s)]
*  the case at all. It was a radicalized far right-wing extremist Trump supporter [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1200.24s)]
*  type of person who, and we know he's a Trump supporter because his roommate talked about [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1208.24s)]
*  that he's a Trump supporter. His views were like Timothy McVeigh style views. But Annapallina Luna [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1212.6399999999999s)]
*  is now on that conspiracy and she's moved away of talking about Epstein because, well, well, well, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1220.8s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't want that to be the topic. But the people know, hence the signs. Tell me [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6iFc72tgAM&t=1229.28s)]
