# Trump Witnesses UNRAVEL under CROSS EXAM at Hearing
**MeidasTouch:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk)
*  Let's take a look at this cross-examination by Democratic senators of Donald Trump's cabinet and Donald Trump's administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=0.0s)]
*  Right here. You have a Democratic senator Merkley cross-examining [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=8.84s)]
*  FBI director cash Patel about whether or not he intends to launch an investigation of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  reported violations of due process of several hundred individuals who were put in concentration camps in El Salvador [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=21.28s)]
*  Let's watch it. It is your job to investigate crimes. Yes. I agree with the Fifth Amendment [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=28.56s)]
*  I agree with the entire Constitution and the men and women at the FBI [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=33.32s)]
*  Decide so are you going to launch an investigation of the reported violation of the due process of several hundred individuals? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=36.72s)]
*  Again senator, it's not for me to call the balls and strikes on it the men and women at the FBI who are trained to open [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=44.28s)]
*  Investigations will make those calls [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  So you have no influence over where there an investigation is is [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  Opened I have influence over it, but you're asking me a constitutional question [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=56.800000000000004s)]
*  I'm not a constitutional scholars actually not a con. It's a it's a question also of law [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=60.74s)]
*  Your position is that every one of those individuals is by constitutional right afforded due process? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=64.92s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that. I'm telling you you haven't you haven't read the Constitution. I've got us all persons [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=70.72s)]
*  I've got it right here [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=75.92s)]
*  But what you're saying is that every single one of the illegals that was sent down to a Salvador's is supposed to be given due process [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=76.92s)]
*  That's what the Constitution says [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  It does say no person. Yeah, I'll encourage you to read it because it's also been a firm by the Supreme Court [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  Repeatedly on the case of Miranda versus, Arizona held the right of all individuals regardless of citizenship status [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=95.04s)]
*  The Supreme Court in Reno versus Flores [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=102.92s)]
*  I mean, but it's the plain language of the Constitution [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  It concerns me that you're not familiar with the core concept of due process applying to all persons as written in black and white in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=108.11999999999999s)]
*  the Constitution next up we have [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=114.78s)]
*  Democratic Senator Murray cross-examining FBI director cross-examining FBI director cash Patel [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=116.84s)]
*  About why he has not even produced what his FBI? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Budget is going to be when coming before a Senate committee about to that budget [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=128.0s)]
*  You'll see cash Patel looks like a like a little kid who hasn't done their homework [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=132.8s)]
*  It's just so incompetent play this clip. It was due last week by law. I [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  understand and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=142.28s)]
*  Your answer is you just understand you're not gonna follow the law [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  My answer is that I am following the law and I'm working with my interagency partners to do this and get you the budget [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=146.92s)]
*  That you are required to have and you have no timeline [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=153.17999999999998s)]
*  No [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=157.04s)]
*  Hmm well we also need a full budget request not a single paragraph full of wild talking points that we saw with the skinny [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=159.04s)]
*  budget proposal [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=166.04s)]
*  We're now having a budget hearing without a budget request. So director Patel. Where is the FY 2026 budget request for the FBI? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=167.56s)]
*  It's being worked on them. Have you reviewed it? Have you approved it? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=176.64s)]
*  Not yet. When will we get it as soon as I can get it for my interagency partner [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  I can get it from my interagency partners and get it approved [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=186.96s)]
*  Six months from now. I don't know ma'am [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, how do we as Congress do our budget in our work without that request without the spend plan? Well, ma'am [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=193.44s)]
*  I'm here. I'm doing the best I can I can't make up answers [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm gonna commit to you to work on getting you the information you need that that is insufficient and deeply disturbing [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=202.4s)]
*  No response I've given my response [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=211.12s)]
*  And then of course cash Patel gets way too emotional these Trump MAGA guys can't control their emotions at all [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=217.0s)]
*  So cash Patel got angry that he didn't do his homework and didn't even submit the basic budget documents [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=224.68s)]
*  So here he gets mad at Senator Murray and says he's not going to tolerate her here play this clip placed on leave FBI employees [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=230.3s)]
*  Responsible for the investigation of January 6th. That sounds political to me [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=239.12s)]
*  I have not placed anyone on leave who has not violated their ethical obligation or their oath to the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=243.52s)]
*  They were investigating January 6 you believe they were violating an ethic of no [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  I think the common theme here is you putting words in my mouth and I'm not going to tolerate it [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=255.18s)]
*  No, really men and women of the FBI [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=259.12s)]
*  Well, you did place on leave an analyst responsible for investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 election [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=261.6s)]
*  Is that politicization is that retribution? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  No, not if she broke the law or the ethical guidelines [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=270.71999999999997s)]

*  But that's the standard and we will hold ourselves inwardly accountable and we will not be [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=274.78s)]
*  Strayed from our mission because people think we are politicizing the bureau [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  If you want to talk about someone who was attacked by a weaponized bureau [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=283.24s)]
*  You're looking at him and now he's the director of the FBI and he's cleaning it up [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=286.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's what we call a sociopath right there. They all have that Trump sociopath [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=289.91999999999996s)]

*  The ruling and that is that is that is readily chilling the balance of powers in a democracy that relies on the executive [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=435.52000000000004s)]

*  I don't make decisions on legal status here in the United States [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=459.2s)]
*  The Department of State does that and I would say that as they've gone through an evaluation of who gets a visa [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=463.4s)]
*  Who gets legal status green cards? They've been evaluating and discussing how that applies [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=469.64s)]
*  Well, I acknowledge that you don't I acknowledge you don't make right but if someone is a legal permanent resident of the United States [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=476.52s)]
*  I'm not talking about an h1b or a student visa holder [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=484.08s)]
*  I'm talking about a legal permanent resident if you are a legal permanent resident [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  Do you have the right to detain or deport that person simply for expressing their political opinion? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=491.12s)]
*  the Department of State makes those decisions and the Department of Homeland Security [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=497.04s)]
*  You make that you make that decision about who you have the right to detain or deport [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=501.88s)]
*  So do you you are involved in that? Did you believe the United States? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=507.04s)]
*  Do you believe the law allows the Department of Homeland Security under the Trump administration is [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=510.64s)]
*  Enforcing the law following the constitutional rights of folks who are here as citizens [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=515.72s)]
*  Those who are here legally and those who are here illegally. So a legal permanent resident is by definition here legally. Do you believe I? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=520.88s)]
*  Mean, I think this is really troubling if you can't answer this simple question. Do you believe? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=529.0s)]
*  That the US government can detain and deport a legal permanent resident for expressing a [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  Political opinion that the department that the administration disagrees with the determination you're asking for is based on [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK5-90n4IDk&t=541.4399999999999s)]
