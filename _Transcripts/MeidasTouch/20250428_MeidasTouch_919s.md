# PANICKED Trump FREAKS OUT in AM as IT ALL GOES WRONG
**MeidasTouch:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs)
*  Donald Trump is panic posting on Monday morning. He's attacking pollsters since Donald Trump's polls are the lowest in modern presidential history [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=0.0s)]
*  They're actually the lowest going back probably about 80 years [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=9.36s)]
*  He refers to pollsters whose polls he doesn't like as this is a direct quote [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=13.44s)]
*  negative [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=19.82s)]
*  Criminals, he then calls them frauds [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=21.02s)]
*  He says they are sick and that they are truly the enemy of the people and implies that they need to be [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=23.76s)]
*  Imprisoned so as Donald Trump's first post this morning. He then interferes with Canada's election today and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  Asserts that Canada should be the 51st state again [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=40.040000000000006s)]
*  He talks about annexing and conquering Canada and he says that he should be Canada's leader implying that they should vote for him [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=42.900000000000006s)]
*  I mean, this is the most despicable election interference imaginable and it's just embarrassing and humiliating [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=50.92s)]
*  Donald Trump trying to make Canada's election all about himself today [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=57.6s)]
*  Donald Trump posts the following good luck to the great people of Canada [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=63.28s)]
*  Elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=67.72s)]
*  Increase your military power for free to the highest level in the world [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=73.0s)]
*  Have your car steel aluminum lumber energy and all other businesses [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=77.63999999999999s)]
*  Quadruple in size with zero tariffs or taxes if Canada becomes the cherished 51st state of the United States of America [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=82.96s)]
*  No more artificially drawn line for many years ago [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=90.16s)]
*  Look how beautiful this landmass would be free access with no border all positives with no negatives [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=93.6s)]
*  It was meant to be exclamation point [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  America can no longer subsidize Canada with the hundreds of billions of dollars a year that we have been spending in the past [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  It makes no sense unless Canada is a state [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=110.0s)]
*  I'm sorry Canada [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=115.4s)]
*  I mean, this is some of the most despicable behavior imaginable right here and it just goes to show you just again how [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=116.84s)]
*  immature Donald Trump is as well and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=124.92s)]
*  How violent dangerous he is and of course everything he's saying here is false and fraudulent [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=128.08s)]
*  I mean [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=133.6s)]
*  Donald Trump has taken a wrecking ball to the United States and Donald Trump wants to see Canada destroyed and the fact that Donald Trump wants [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=134.52s)]
*  To make Canada's election about himself is just again. There's really no words for it other than it's just it's humiliating for the United States [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=142.16s)]
*  So then Donald Trump sends out his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for this interview on Fox [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=150.08s)]
*  Brian Kilmeade this morning asks Scott Bessent Donald Trump's Treasury Secretary if he's worried about empty shelves [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  in stores since shipping from China has essentially come to a halt and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=165.48s)]
*  Since products are not reaching the United States of America [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=170.92s)]
*  Listen to what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says and his typical arrogant and smug way play this clip [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=174.44s)]
*  currently right now [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=181.72s)]
*  When you are you worried about empty shelves because they say that a lot of these [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  Supply lines and the cargo ships are being held up a lot of people are saying turn it around with the taps this high [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=188.11999999999998s)]
*  I don't want the product. Are you worried about empty shelves? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=193.11999999999998s)]
*  Not a present. We have some great retailers. I assume they pre-ordered [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=196.83999999999997s)]
*  I think we'll see some elasticities and think we'll see [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=201.48s)]
*  Replacements and then we will see they how quickly the Chinese wanted to escalate tomorrow [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=204.88s)]
*  Did you hear what he said right there? He goes I'm not worried about it at the present at the present [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=211.48s)]
*  I'm not worried about are you gonna be worried about it in the future? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  Are you gonna be worried about it in the next few weeks? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  When products are not on our shelves when there's a summer of scarcity [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=221.92s)]
*  When someone's air conditioning breaks down and they can't fix it when kids can't get school supplies [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  When people can't buy gifts for people for Christmas at what point? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  Scott Besson are you going to be a little bit worried about it because it seems that your job as the Treasury Secretary [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=237.4s)]
*  should be not to engage in trade wars that destroy the United States of America's economy and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=243.8s)]
*  strengthen the rest of the world by the way and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  So here Brian Kilmeade asks Treasury Secretary Besson some more questions about China and you see Scott Besson goes [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=253.36s)]
*  Maybe maybe they'll call me someday China [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=261.36s)]
*  Maybe they'll give me a call here play this clip plan a call on your counterpart [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=264.11999999999995s)]
*  We will see what happens with China [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=268.47999999999996s)]
*  That it's [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=273.2s)]
*  It's important. I think it's unsustainable from the Chinese side. So [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=275.0s)]
*  Maybe they'll call me one day. Yeah, the WTO says be a trade could dip [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=280.76s)]
*  80% between the US and China if something doesn't happen quickly. Do you see it that way? Well, look [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  It that's why I believe it's unsustainable [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=292.52s)]
*  Again the level of arrogance here how kind of nonchalant he is about this [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=294.52s)]
*  While America's economy is suffering and we can see again trucking volumes and freight volumes coming to an absolute halt [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=300.35999999999996s)]
*  You know a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson overnight said the following. Let me make it clear one more time [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  China and the US are not engaged in any [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=317.08s)]
*  consultation or [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=323.0s)]
*  negotiation on [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=324.64s)]
*  Tariffs China's been making it clear over and over again despite Donald Trump over the weekend once more [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=326.2s)]
*  Lying and saying that he's been involved in direct [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=333.24s)]
*  negotiations with [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=336.64s)]
*  China's president Xi Jinping and that there are all these conversations taking place and deals are imminent China saying there's no [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  Conversations taking place. Let us be very very clear [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  And by the way, how do we know that's accurate because we can see trucking volumes [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=349.18s)]
*  We can see freight volumes we can see that there's no movement at all on any of the on any of the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  Trade war issues. So then the White House held a press conference early in the morning [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=362.68s)]
*  They brought in their border czar. They call him Tom Homan in front of the White House [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=368.2s)]
*  They had placards of [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=373.97999999999996s)]
*  Mugshots of migrants set up in the area where reporters do their media hits [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=376.58s)]
*  You can see him right there these placards in the mugshot. So the whole [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=381.94s)]
*  White House lawn had these mugshot placards on him. So what were they talking about at the press briefing earlier this morning? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=386.94s)]
*  Caroline Levitt [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=395.06s)]
*  the chief propagandist [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=396.74s)]

*  The Colorado College quarterback Shador Sanders [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=400.94s)]
*  Getting picked in the draft [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=406.66s)]
*  Four rounds after Donald Trump made a post about Shador Sanders saying he needs to be drafted now [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=409.02s)]
*  Four rounds after tell me you know nothing about sports without telling me, you know nothing about sports [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=417.06s)]
*  And why are you talking about this here play this clip? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=423.15999999999997s)]
*  After the president's truth social post the Browns finally took Shador Sanders [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=426.02s)]
*  Does the president think he deserves credit for Sanders getting picked and does he think going to the Browns is better than being undrafted? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=432.46s)]
*  All I will say is the president put out a statement and a few rounds later he was drafted [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=442.65999999999997s)]
*  So I think the facts speak for themselves on that one fear [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroTfzoUxcs&t=447.32s)]
