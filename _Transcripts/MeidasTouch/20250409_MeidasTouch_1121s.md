# WHOA! Bernie BRINGS THE HOUSE DOWN at Town Hall
**MeidasTouch:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI)
*  This is how it's done, folks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders sat for a town hall with Anderson Cooper on CNN, but Bernie Sanders [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1.76s)]
*  was not afraid to call out corporate news directly to Anderson Cooper's face. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=8.66s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders was not afraid to call out the cowardly law firms submitting and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=14.32s)]
*  making deals with Donald Trump, turning their back against the Constitution. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=19.86s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders was not afraid to call out American universities for turning on their [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=24.46s)]
*  students. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=30.94s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders was not afraid to call out the United States health care system and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=31.94s)]
*  the United States government for not providing health care services as a guarantee to its [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=38.02s)]
*  citizens and to the people of this country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=44.06s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders standing up for workers, showing it how it's done. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=46.82s)]
*  Let's take a look at what he said here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=52.14s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders said, I sure hope that when other people come into power, when this [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=53.62s)]
*  Trump regime error is done, we remember who the cowards were, who the people who turned [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=59.26s)]
*  against the Constitution are. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=65.02s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=66.5s)]
*  They ashamed of themselves. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=67.5s)]
*  And when Trump is out of office and others gain power, I hope we do not forget the cowardice [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=70.02s)]
*  not only of these law firms, but by the way, you've got major universities like Harvard [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=75.68s)]
*  and Columbia. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=81.22s)]
*  You've got some of the great universities in the world. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=82.22s)]
*  And yet, out of fear of losing their grants, and I understand that they got a lot of money [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=85.5s)]
*  there, they are willing to change their curriculum to bow down before Trump. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=91.38s)]
*  You add all of that together, the attack on the attack on law firms. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=97.5s)]
*  You have Trump for the first time in history saying to a judge, oh, you ruled against me. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=105.1s)]
*  I don't like the decision you rendered. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=111.18s)]
*  We're going to impeach you. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=113.58000000000001s)]
*  That's not America. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=114.58000000000001s)]
*  What our Constitution is about is a separation of power, executive, judiciary, legislative, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  and independent judiciary. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=124.86000000000001s)]
*  You don't threaten and intimidate judges because they rule against you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=126.58000000000001s)]
*  That is a movement toward authoritarianism. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=130.98000000000002s)]
*  And I would hope very much that not only Democrats and independents, but my Republican colleagues, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=133.82s)]
*  we could disagree on all the issues. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=140.06s)]
*  But for God's sake, let us not become an authoritarian country where one guy, one guy assumes all [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=142.26s)]
*  of the power. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=148.22s)]
*  That is not what people fought and died to create in this country. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=149.26s)]
*  If somebody gets next, Senator Bernie Sanders goes after the law firms who have bent the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=152.4s)]
*  knee and submitted to Trump, play this clip. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=157.26s)]
*  The idea that the president of the United States would threaten and harass attorneys [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=160.38s)]
*  and law firms that defended people he did not like is a major step forward toward authoritarianism. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=168.01999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, some of these big law firms, was it Paul Weiss is one of them? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=178.26s)]
*  One of the biggest. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=183.73999999999998s)]
*  Caved in. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=184.74s)]
*  We looked at these law firms who have hundreds of well-paid lawyers to defend the Constitution, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=186.38s)]
*  to defend the rule of law. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=192.12s)]
*  And these guys, big law firms, who often, by the way, defended Democrats, they were [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=193.76s)]
*  more interested in getting millions of dollars from their lobbying or whatever the hell they [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=199.44s)]
*  do in Washington, D.C., making huge amounts of money than standing tall and defending [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=203.88s)]
*  the Constitution. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=209.04s)]
*  They should be ashamed of themselves. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=210.04s)]
*  Next Senator Bernie Sanders looks at the crowd and says, raise your hand if you think the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=212.48s)]
*  American health care system is broken. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=217.16s)]
*  Everybody raises their hand and Anderson Cooper tries to say, okay, it looks like the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=219.76s)]
*  majority and Sanders is like, nope, everybody just raised their hand. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=224.0s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  What I love about Senator Bernie Sanders here is that he's not just going along with the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  corporate news narrative. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=233.78s)]
*  He's saying, here's what's going down. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=236.56s)]
*  Raise your hand if you think the American health care system is broken. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=237.56s)]
*  Raise your hand. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  Majority. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=241.95999999999998s)]
*  Not a majority. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  Pretty much. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  I can see behind that guy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  And that is our question again. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=249.52s)]
*  How many nations, wealthy nations in the world, do not guarantee health care to all people [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=252.52s)]
*  is the human right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=257.04s)]
*  Anybody know the answer? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=258.56s)]
*  Which country? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  United States. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=261.40000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  Now, you're not going to hear much about that on corporate television. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  You're not going to hear much about that in the United States Congress. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=267.64s)]
*  We are the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=272.64s)]
*  85 million of us are uninsured or underinsured. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=277.72s)]
*  60,000 die each year because we can't get to a doctor on time. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=280.72s)]
*  That's the bad news. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=285.56s)]
*  You know what the good news is? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=286.56s)]
*  The insurance companies are making tens of billions of dollars every year denying you [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=287.56s)]
*  coverage. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=290.72s)]
*  The drug companies charge us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=291.72s)]
*  So how does it happen that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we're [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=296.38000000000005s)]
*  spending twice as much per capita as the people in other countries, and yet we have one of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=300.16s)]
*  the worst health care outcomes of any country on earth? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=304.48s)]
*  And it gets back to money in politics and the domination of big money, in this case [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=308.12s)]
*  insurance companies, drug companies, over the Republican and Democratic. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=313.02000000000004s)]
*  I want to try to get some more of our audience questions. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  I know you do, but I want to talk about... [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=318.72s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=320.76s)]
*  No, I want to... [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=321.76s)]
*  You know, sometimes these issues about health care, about income and wealth inequality are [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=322.76s)]
*  not talked about in the corporate media. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  And it's time that we did talk about them. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=332.32s)]
*  That's why the question at the moment is why are people losing faith in the American system? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=335.08s)]
*  We don't talk about it on CNN. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=338.84s)]
*  We don't talk about it in Congress. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=340.28s)]
*  It's because they understand that a handful of billionaires exert enormous influence. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=342.0s)]
*  And that has got to change. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders talks about the broader implications that if Elon Musk can do this [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=349.24s)]
*  to the federal government, think about your jobs and what he's going to do to everybody [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=353.2s)]
*  as AI gets more advanced as well. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=357.28s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  Many people are saying, wow, that's outrageous. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=361.20000000000005s)]
*  I really feel for these federal employees thrown out on the street. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=362.92s)]
*  But I want you to think about this. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=366.20000000000005s)]
*  If Musk can do this to federal employees, some of whom are in unions, some of whom will [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=368.20000000000005s)]
*  work for years, what do you think he's going to be doing when artificial intelligence and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=373.72s)]
*  robotics comes for your job? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=379.92s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=382.56s)]
*  The job you have today ain't going to be here in 10 or 15 years. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=383.56s)]
*  And you think Musk and his friends are saying, oh, my goodness, how do we protect American [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=386.88s)]
*  workers from the explosion in technology that we're seeing? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=391.56s)]
*  They don't give a damn about you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=395.76s)]
*  If this is what they could do to federal employees, think about what they could do to people in [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=397.68s)]
*  the private sector. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=401.52s)]
*  So bottom line there is I am not a Luddite. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=403.02s)]
*  I think technology has many positive things to say. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=406.88s)]
*  But we have got to understand that new technology, AI, robotics, has got to work for working [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=410.46s)]
*  people, not just for the billionaires and Mr. Musk. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=415.97999999999996s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders next talks about the United States having the highest rate of childhood [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=420.62s)]
*  poverty of almost any major country. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=426.58s)]
*  And that apparently that this is something that corporate news doesn't want to talk about. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=430.09999999999997s)]
*  I love how no matter what the questions Anderson Cooper was trying to frame in the framework [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=434.29999999999995s)]
*  of corporate news, Bernie Sanders brought it right back to the central issues that are [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=440.26s)]

*  So I'm running around the country with Alexandria and other people. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=448.18s)]
*  What we are trying to do is demand that working class people begin to stand up and fight for [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=451.26s)]
*  their rights. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=456.78s)]
*  There is no reason we should be the only major country not to have health care, not to have [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=457.78s)]
*  paid family and medical leave, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=461.65999999999997s)]
*  Why we have the highest rate of childhood poverty almost any major country. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=465.18s)]
*  Twenty percent of our seniors living on fifteen thousand dollars a year. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=468.78s)]
*  Anybody here think that makes sense? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=472.74s)]
*  All right, it doesn't. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=474.74s)]
*  But you've got to get CNN to talk about these issues. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=476.78000000000003s)]
*  You've got to get your members of Congress to talk about these issues. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=480.06s)]
*  We're literally talking about it right now. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=488.3s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm forcing you to talk about it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=489.86s)]

*  But for some reason, liver health doesn't always get the attention that it deserves. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=501.54s)]
*  Dose for your liver was formulated to cleanse your liver of unwanted elements, aid digestion [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=505.54s)]
*  and maintain your body's filter. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=510.46000000000004s)]
*  Why does this matter? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=512.58s)]
*  Well, your liver is the second largest organ in your body and is responsible for over 500 [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=513.58s)]
*  functions in your body. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=519.3000000000001s)]
*  It acts as your body's filter, flushing out unwanted elements and breaking down what you [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=520.74s)]
*  consume into essential nutrients. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=524.9200000000001s)]
*  The liver produces and regulates cholesterol, stores vitamins and minerals and impacts [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=528.44s)]

*  Dose's science-backed formula promotes liver function, aids digestion, eases bloating and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=536.0s)]
*  even boosts energy levels. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=540.48s)]
*  Clinical results. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=542.6s)]
*  In a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, dose for your liver lowered liver enzyme [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=543.6s)]
*  levels by 50% in over 86% of participants. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=548.5200000000001s)]
*  Stick with dose and feel the incredible benefits. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=553.24s)]
*  Over time, with more energy, better digestion, reduced bloating, healthier liver enzyme function, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=556.08s)]
*  reduction of brain fog and better sleep, one dose for your liver shot is equivalent to [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=561.36s)]

*  coming days, so keep checking back on our YouTube channel that I think what Trump's [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=595.4399999999999s)]

*  Here, play this clip. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=612.76s)]
*  You've talked about concerns about ecliptocracy in the United States. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=613.76s)]
*  This morning, President Trump posted on social media that it was, quote, a great time to [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=617.4799999999999s)]
*  buy stocks. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=621.04s)]
*  A few hours later, he announced a pause on tariffs, which sent the market skyrocketing. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=622.04s)]
*  Your colleague, Senator Adam Schiff, says Congress should investigate whether Trump [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=626.0s)]
*  and his inner circle engage in insider trading. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=630.24s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=632.36s)]
*  I noticed that. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=633.36s)]
*  And that's just one of another outrageous thing. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=634.36s)]
*  Do I have? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=637.4399999999999s)]
*  No, I don't know for a fact. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=638.4399999999999s)]
*  But would I be surprised if there were people who hours before knew exactly what Trump was [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=640.0799999999999s)]
*  going to do in rescinding his tariff proposals, understanding that the stock market would [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=645.3599999999999s)]
*  soar and you make huge amounts of money? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=650.5999999999999s)]
*  Would I be shocked if we learned about that in the days to come? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=652.4799999999999s)]
*  No, I would not. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=655.4s)]
*  Does that announcement that he gave, gave cover to anybody who did buy stocks? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=656.4s)]
*  Well, what it does do, look, if you know two hours earlier that the stock market's going [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=659.8s)]
*  to go, what are you going to do? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=665.0799999999999s)]
*  Buy a hell of a lot of stock. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=666.12s)]
*  You can invest in the stock market. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=667.12s)]
*  But it's not only that. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=669.2s)]
*  I mean, you've got a president of the United States who is now working to give government [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=670.2s)]
*  cover to crypto and who now whose family is involved in crypto makes money by selling [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=674.6s)]
*  coins, crypto coins. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=682.0400000000001s)]
*  Anybody can contribute, which is a direct line to the president. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=685.32s)]
*  So I have serious problems about all that. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=688.32s)]
*  This is yeah. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=691.2800000000001s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders says, look, if you use tariffs the right way, there are ways [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=692.48s)]
*  that tariffs could potentially work. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=696.9599999999999s)]
*  However, if you're applying some cockamamie formula and applying tariffs against the world [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=699.68s)]
*  and your allies and rolling it out in such a disorganized fashion, it's a mess. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=705.6s)]
*  It's dangerous and it's economy crashing. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=713.68s)]
*  It's a question. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=714.68s)]
*  Look, what I think is. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=715.68s)]
*  Tariffs used selectively are a good idea if they're going to protect American jobs, but [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=719.52s)]
*  to arbitrarily out of nowhere come up with a tariff that they can't even justify or explain [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=725.04s)]
*  to virtually every country on earth is absolutely counterproductive. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=731.52s)]
*  Those tariffs are aimed at part. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=735.2399999999999s)]
*  The president talks about bringing manufacturing jobs to America. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=737.28s)]
*  The White House talked about iPhones being made here in America. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=740.5999999999999s)]
*  Economists have said that it would cost thousands of extra dollars to buy an iPhone. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=744.68s)]
*  Is that realistic? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=748.76s)]
*  I think I don't know the answer to that. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=749.9599999999999s)]
*  But what I do know is the immediate harm is going to be very significant. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=752.1999999999999s)]
*  And it is going to. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=757.12s)]
*  I was just in Target the other day buying something and I looked around there. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=758.8399999999999s)]
*  Virtually all of those products sold in stores like Target are going to see significant increases [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=763.0799999999999s)]
*  in prices if Trump gets his way with tariffs. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=769.16s)]
*  That's going to hurt working people a whole lot. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=771.28s)]
*  And then let me show you how this all kind of started off here where Anderson Cooper [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=774.0400000000001s)]
*  wanted to direct the conversation in one area and then Senator Bernie Sanders is like, OK, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=778.5600000000001s)]
*  Anderson, relax. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=784.4000000000001s)]
*  Let me let me make the point that I want to make here. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=785.4000000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=787.88s)]
*  We got a lot of questions on tariffs and I'm going to get to one from the audience in just [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=788.88s)]
*  a moment. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=792.5600000000001s)]
*  But I do want to start off. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=793.5600000000001s)]
*  President Trump just put a 90 day pause on a new round of sweeping tariffs. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=794.5600000000001s)]
*  He's keeping. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=799.2800000000001s)]
*  OK, before we get to that. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=800.2800000000001s)]
*  As I know, tariffs are everybody's mind. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=802.5600000000001s)]
*  I think we all want this to be a serious discussion about some of the most important issues facing [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=805.44s)]
*  America. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=810.0400000000001s)]
*  And as you indicated, I've been running all over the country. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=811.0400000000001s)]
*  And what I hope we can do tonight is do something pretty radical. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=814.36s)]
*  That is tell the truth. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=818.4s)]
*  It's a radical idea here in Washington, D.C. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=820.4s)]
*  And that is to really take a look together, all of us together, no matter what your political [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=823.0s)]
*  point of view may be about what is in fact going on in this country today. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=826.64s)]
*  And as you indicated, I have been running all over the country. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=831.76s)]
*  And I got to tell you that there is a lot of anxiety out there. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=834.84s)]
*  There's a lot of fear. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=837.6s)]
*  People in the richest country in the history of the world are wondering why 60 percent [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=840.44s)]
*  of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=845.8000000000001s)]
*  All of you guys know what paycheck to paycheck is? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=848.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=851.56s)]
*  You know, I grew up in a family that was living paycheck to paycheck. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=852.56s)]
*  And one of the manifestations of living paycheck to paycheck is working class people in America [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=856.84s)]
*  now live six years shorter lives than the rich. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=862.56s)]
*  Anyone have an idea why that is? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=868.48s)]
*  Poverty and what else? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=873.4s)]
*  Stress. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=875.84s)]
*  When you are living paycheck to paycheck and you're wondering whether you can pay the rent, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=877.76s)]
*  whether you can provide get your kid to a doctor when you need to, that eats away at [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=883.08s)]
*  your mind that it eats away at your body and you die younger. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=888.08s)]
*  And what I have seen, Anderson, all over this country is people living under incredible [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=892.0s)]
*  stress, wondering why in the richest country in the world they can't afford health care, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=896.92s)]
*  why they can't afford child care, why the cost of housing is soaring. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=902.96s)]
*  And in the midst of all of that, while 60 percent of our people are living paycheck [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=907.96s)]
*  to paycheck, why is it that three people on top now own more wealth than the bottom half [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=912.4000000000001s)]
*  of American society? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=918.0s)]
*  And you got some zillionaire named Mr. Musk going all over Washington, D.C., dismantling [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=919.2s)]
*  Social Security and the Veterans Administration. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=925.6s)]
*  So those are some of the issues. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=928.2800000000001s)]
*  We got a lot of questions. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=929.2800000000001s)]
*  We got a lot of questions. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=930.2800000000001s)]
*  You know what, as a bonus, let me just share with you a short portion of when I did the [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=931.88s)]
*  interview with Senator Bernie Sanders, what he had to say. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=935.8000000000001s)]
*  This is what he said to me. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=939.0400000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=940.4s)]
*  And here is the reality, which is not talked about very much. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=941.4s)]
*  The reality is that in America today, our life expectancy is about four years less than [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=948.64s)]
*  other wealthy countries. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=956.12s)]
*  But even worse is the fact that if you're working class in America, on average, you [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=958.52s)]
*  live seven to eight years shorter life than people who are wealthy. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=965.52s)]
*  Now, why is that? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=970.32s)]
*  And the answer is not just health care, which is important. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=971.84s)]
*  Working class people, low income people do not have access to the kind of health care [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=975.5600000000001s)]
*  that the rich do. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=979.12s)]
*  But it is the stress, the day to day stress that working class people live under. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=980.64s)]
*  And I grew up in a working class home. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=987.12s)]
*  I know a little bit about what it's like to have a family living paycheck to paycheck. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=990.72s)]
*  And what I did, that was in Altoona, Wisconsin. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=995.6800000000001s)]
*  I said, OK, all right, tell me what it's like to live under economic stress. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=998.5600000000001s)]
*  And people just stood up. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1004.76s)]
*  And one woman says, you know, it's a question of whether I buy shoes for myself or my kids, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1006.5600000000001s)]
*  whether I can afford eyeglasses, whether I can afford to go to the doctor, whether, you [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1011.6s)]
*  know, I'm going to have the money to prepare a decent meal for my kids, that I live every [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1016.56s)]
*  day not knowing what to expect. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1022.9599999999999s)]
*  How do I survive? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1025.36s)]
*  And what that is about, that is the reality that tens of millions of our people are living [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1027.52s)]
*  under. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1033.6s)]
*  We don't talk about it. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1034.1599999999999s)]
*  And what I have learned over the years, that some of the most important issues are the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1035.6s)]
*  issues that get least discussion. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1039.9199999999998s)]
*  And one of those issues is not just the working class people live six years short of life, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1042.3999999999999s)]
*  seven years shorter lives than the rich. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1047.2s)]
*  That's important. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1049.36s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1050.48s)]
*  But what's equally important is 60% of the American people in the richest country on [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1051.6s)]
*  earth live paycheck to paycheck. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1057.04s)]
*  That means they go to work. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1059.52s)]
*  And if their landlord raises the rent, they don't know how they're going to be able to [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1062.0s)]
*  pay for it. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1066.1599999999999s)]
*  Kid gets sick, don't know how to afford to send the kid to the doctor. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1066.6399999999999s)]
*  Car breaks down, don't know how to get it fixed, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1071.52s)]
*  That is the reality facing tens of millions of Americans in the wealthiest country on [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1075.76s)]
*  earth. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1082.0s)]
*  And that is the issue that we got to focus on. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1082.72s)]
*  And that is why we got to transform our economy so that it works for everybody, not just [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1085.36s)]
*  billionaires. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0XBkSJCtI&t=1090.56s)]
