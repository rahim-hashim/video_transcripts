# Trump Quickly UNRAVELS as Catastrophe APPROACHES
**MeidasTouch:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc)
*  Donald Trump is posting AI images of himself as the Pope. This is a very [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=0.0s)]
*  unserious, unstable, vile individual. Meanwhile, the Defense Secretary Pete Hegsup is posting AI [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=6.48s)]
*  cartoon images of himself holding a sword that says, budget cuts, and looking at a dog that says, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=16.88s)]
*  wow, and posting cartoon AI images of himself that say, 100% operational control. And when you zoom in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=26.0s)]
*  on his hands, his sleeve is part of his hands. Why does his finger look like that? Then you have [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=36.24s)]
*  Donald Trump giving an interview with Kristen Welker of Meet the Press, and Donald Trump says [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  that he is okay with a recession. He'd be fine with it. He doesn't care. Here, play this clip. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=48.72s)]
*  And that's my question. Long term. Is it okay in the short term to have a recession? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=54.4s)]
*  Look, yes, everything's okay. What we are, I said, this is a transition period. I think we're going [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=61.04s)]
*  to do fantastic. As former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says, post this image from CNN, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=67.76s)]
*  which is now finally reporting on this, the last boats without crippling tariffs from China [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=75.28s)]
*  are arriving to the US. The countdown to shortages and higher prices has begun. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  No, it's begun three weeks ago, CNN. But as Pete Buttigieg says, this isn't hypothetical. The [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=89.12s)]
*  coming days are bringing higher prices and disrupted supply chains. This time not because [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  of a pandemic or a war, but self-inflicted by our country's government under this president. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=101.92000000000002s)]
*  How long have we been talking about freight volumes and trucking volumes and showing you [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=110.24s)]
*  photos of the ports here on the Midas Touch Network? As Senator Bernie Sanders told me, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=115.36s)]
*  sometimes the most important issues are what news isn't talking about. It's why I talk about these [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=122.56s)]
*  things here over and over again, because we can follow the data where these things are headed [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=126.96s)]
*  so it doesn't hit us like a shock. That's why we report on this stuff weeks in advance [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=132.95999999999998s)]
*  on the Midas Touch Network. We also learned yesterday that the Trump administration will [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=138.8s)]
*  not renew Biden-era grants worth $1 billion that were aimed at boosting mental health services in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=144.72s)]
*  schools, a Department of Education spokesperson confirmed to ABC. As Travis Aker says, I do not [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=152.8s)]
*  understand why mental health programs are being defunded by President Trump when every school [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  shooting is blamed on mental health by MAGA Republicans. I just want you to think about that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=168.16s)]
*  Every time there's a school shooting, the MAGA Republicans say, it's not because of the guns, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=175.28s)]
*  it's because of mental health. Okay, well now you're defunding mental health services to schools? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=180.0s)]
*  Cruelty is the point, folks. This shouldn't be a political issue. I'm just giving you the data [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=187.2s)]
*  points. I'm not speculating what they're doing. I'm reading you statements that the Trump MAGA [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=192.96s)]
*  regime is confirming. Oh, another post by Donald Trump. Oh, he's doing the cartoon image of himself [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=198.24s)]
*  right now. Oh, what's he saying in this post? Oh, that he ended inflation and made America [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=204.16s)]
*  affordable again. Wow, I guess it must be done. So it's been said it must be done. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=209.36s)]
*  Donald Trump says that he promised Americans that he would rapidly drive the prices down, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=215.12s)]
*  and he says, promise kept on this image that he posts, White House delivering emergency [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=220.72s)]
*  price relief for American families and they defeated the cost of living crisis. Folks, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=226.24s)]
*  mission accomplished. The cost of living crisis has been defeated. Donald Trump, thank you. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=231.84s)]
*  Thank you for doing that. Yes, I go to the get my gas prices $1.98. Egg prices down 87%. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=238.32s)]
*  Whoa, you tell me that my MAGA mush brain says, OK, Donald Donald, I understand you have MAGA [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=247.68s)]
*  mush brain cult followers who watch Fox. The rest of us, we can we can go to stores. We can see it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  We know that prices are not going down. We know housing is less affordable, not more affordable. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=260.48s)]
*  We see what you're doing to the economy. It's not good. It's very bad. Oh, Charlie Kirk, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=266.08s)]
*  someone who's in Donald Trump's inner circle, also potentially saying that more firings are [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=272.56s)]
*  coming at the CIA. We'll see about that. One thing over here to Ryan Cummings [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=279.92s)]
*  said he did an analysis. Oh, my God. I think Garrett is correct. Garrett Golden goes, Oh, man, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=287.44s)]
*  I think someone is showing the president the RBOB charts and telling him that that's the price of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=294.56s)]
*  gasoline. POTUS's team is showing him the cost of wholesale unfinished gasoline, which does not [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=301.12s)]
*  include the cost of oxygenates, ethanol and all distribution marketing costs and telling him this [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  is the price of gasoline you are paying at the pump. So I guess the same way Donald Trump's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=313.04s)]
*  people told him that he won at the Supreme Court with the Brago Garcia 9 to 0, that he won and he [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=319.52s)]
*  does not have to facilitate the return when the order was the exact opposite. I guess they're [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=325.12s)]
*  telling Donald Trump that the price of gas at the pump is 198 because they're showing him [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=330.24s)]
*  the cost of without oxygenates. That's really what they're doing. By the way, what are we on? What [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=337.52s)]
*  day are we on? Day 21, 22, 23, no trade deals, no deal Donald. That's his nickname. Now we're learning [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=343.6s)]
*  that Japan, an ally of the United States, should be easy to make a deal with Japan. Since Trump made [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=351.12s)]
*  a deal with Japan in 2018, Trump made the Japan deal in 2018 and now he hates his own deal. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=355.68s)]
*  The same way Trump made the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, the USMCA, and he hates [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=364.16s)]
*  that agreement. He goes, whoever made this deal is the stupidest. You made the deal with Japan, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  you made the deal with Canada and Mexico, so you're the stupid one. Japan is preparing to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=374.64s)]
*  use its role as America's largest creditor, holds 1.1 trillion in treasuries as leverage in Trump [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=380.08s)]
*  trade talks. This, as Tmoo halts shipping direct from China as the de minimis tariff loophole is [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=388.0s)]
*  cut off. You will now see if you were to buy at Tmoo or any of these stores in China, 145% [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  basically added to the cost. Tmoo is just saying, all right, we're not going to send anything [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  to the United States anymore. By the way, when I think about Tmoo now, I think about Tmoo Trump [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=408.16s)]
*  in Australia, Peter Dutton in Australia, the leader of the Liberal Party there, which is their [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=414.24s)]
*  right-wing party. Peter Dutton, the Trump effect is real in Australia as Anthony Albanese soaring [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=420.32000000000005s)]
*  ahead, the Labour Party doing well in Australia. That's their Liberal Party there. It's confusing. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=428.72s)]
*  Their left party is the Labour Party. On his way potentially to another three-year term there, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=434.96s)]
*  shout out Mitus Down Under, Mitus Mate, tell me which one you like better. More Donald Trump [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=439.68s)]
*  posting that the price of gasoline is 198 and egg prices are down, which is a lie. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  JD Vance saying Russia's war in Ukraine is not going to end anytime soon, where Donald Trump [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=452.4s)]
*  said earlier in the week that it was a joke when he said that there would be peace in 24 hours. He [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=459.28s)]
*  said in a Donald Trump way, I was joking. I was joking. I know it's only the fake news that took [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  me seriously. You're fake news if you thought I really meant there would be peace. Only the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=471.2s)]
*  fake news. You're so dishonest. I was joking about making peace in 24 hours. Now JD Vance saying, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=475.2s)]
*  not going to end anytime soon. Okay, JD. Okay, JD. Also a new poll from The Hill. Majority of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=482.64000000000004s)]
*  US Latino voters believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. Really? I mean, the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  Venezuelans for Trump aren't happy that he's deporting family members back to Maduro and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=497.12s)]
*  sending Venezuelans to concentration camps in El Salvador when he said he got your back. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=504.88s)]
*  The Cubans for Trump, you're unhappy that Donald Trump is taking away family members [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=510.56s)]
*  and sending them back to the Castro regime, sending them back to Cuba, separating mothers [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=517.76s)]
*  in Miami who are still breastfeeding their children to be homeless in Cuba, even taking [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=522.88s)]
*  away temporary protected status from 500,000 Latinos. He told you he wasn't going to do that, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=529.36s)]
*  right? You thought it was only the criminals. He thinks you're criminal. He thinks you're the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=536.4s)]
*  criminal. We told you we tried to warn you. Okay, but don't get me wrong. Trump's been focused on [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=541.52s)]
*  making deals this week. Not deals that benefit America. Don Jr. starting the Executive Branch [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=547.36s)]
*  Club, $500,000 to join his exclusive club called the Executive Branch. Imagine if Hunter Biden [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=552.88s)]
*  did that. Donald Trump making a deal with Qatar to have a new Trump resort in Qatar. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  UAE's minister met with Donald Trump. Trump gave them some AI chip exemptions. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=566.3199999999999s)]
*  And Abu Dhabi then agreed to use Trump's crypto as part of their transactions. All in a week. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  And by the way, while Donald Trump was gutting mental health services at schools, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=582.96s)]
*  gutting PBS and NPR, he was focused on spending $92 million, maybe even more, to throw himself [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=587.76s)]
*  a military theme parade in Washington, D.C. in the coming months where he wants to have 6,000 [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=597.1999999999999s)]
*  soldiers, 50 helicopters, fighter jets, as he stands there like a Kim Jong-un-style dictator [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=604.8s)]
*  as troops march in front of him. Can we talk about that he's posting AI images of himself [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=615.2s)]
*  dressed as the pope? This is an unwell individual, but I don't want to use that as a way for him to [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=622.24s)]
*  duck accountability. Let's just call him what he is. He's a vile piece of trash. He's a felon. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=628.1600000000001s)]
*  He's a fraud. He's a criminal. He's a sexual abuser. He's trash. I have zero respect for him. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=634.1600000000001s)]
*  Period. Full stop. Zero. You shouldn't either. Hit subscribe. Let's get to 5 million subscribers. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jvvHp9BEqc&t=642.08s)]
