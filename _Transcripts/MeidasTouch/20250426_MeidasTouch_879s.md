# FATIGUED Trump LOSES CONTROL as Term COLLAPSES
**MeidasTouch:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo)
*  I mean, just take a look at him. He is an addled, fatigued, cognitive glitching mess of a human being who is dangerous. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=0.0s)]
*  He's been lying about fake conversations he claims he's having with China's President Xi Jinping. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=11.48s)]
*  The embassy from China had to say, stop making up fake conversations. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=19.96s)]
*  We're not having any communications with the United States about tariffs. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=24.96s)]
*  And Donald Trump just the whole day was inventing, oh, we're having productive conversations. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  We're speaking about it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=34.24s)]
*  So then Donald Trump gets on Air Force One. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=35.68s)]
*  He's on his way to Rome where he's going to be there for the funeral of Pope Francis. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=38.6s)]
*  And a reporter asks him, so like, have you spoken to Xi Jinping? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=45.32s)]
*  And then Donald Trump's like, I don't want to discuss that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=49.08s)]
*  I'm not discussing that. Here, play this clip. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  Is that since taking office, sir? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=59.12s)]
*  I don't want to discuss that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=61.64s)]
*  I'm speaking to a lot of people from China, but I'm speaking to people from all over the world, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=63.64s)]
*  from all the tariffs, and we're making very good deals. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=70.12s)]
*  It's going to make our country rich. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=73.64s)]
*  We're not going to be ripped off like we have been for the last literally 50 years. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=76.64s)]
*  Okay, well, what do you want to discuss, Donald? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=81.64s)]
*  A reporter asked Donald Trump, so do you have any updates [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=84.64s)]
*  on Hegseth? And Donald Trump's like surprised by the question. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=88.64s)]
*  Like, what? Well, what do you mean Hegseth? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=92.16s)]
*  I don't know that your defense secretary continues to have classified communications [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=94.76s)]
*  on Signal and on text threads, and he brags about war plans placing our fighter pilots [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=101.64s)]
*  and troops in jeopardy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=108.04s)]
*  By the way, while Houthis are shooting down our drones, like seven drones have been shot down [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=109.84s)]
*  over Yemen. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  Is this something that you're focused on here? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I am pretty good at it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, have you updated on Secretary Hegseth? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  Your confidence in him? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  About what? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=129.88s)]
*  With Signal, having Signal on his item. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=130.88s)]
*  Do you signal on your computer? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=132.88s)]
*  I don't. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=134.88s)]
*  Do you signal on your keyboard? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=135.88s)]
*  I think it's fake news. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=137.88s)]
*  You said you're going to be meeting with some leaders while you're in. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=139.88s)]
*  Did you hear what he said? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=142.88s)]
*  He said, I don't view that as even important. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=143.88s)]
*  I think it's fake news. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=146.0s)]
*  As one commentator wrote, using a private email server, the worst intelligence catastrophe [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=149.0s)]
*  in history, leaking classified war plans, not important. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=156.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=161.0s)]
*  Blatantly just leaking our war plans on purpose. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=162.0s)]
*  When we know that Russia, we know that the Houthis, we know that China and other people [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=166.0s)]
*  are gaining access to this stuff. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=171.0s)]
*  So then another reporter asks him, and again, when I say like adult having cognitive issues, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=174.12s)]
*  I mean, look at this person. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=179.12s)]
*  Like this is not normal behavior. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=180.12s)]
*  For all the media talking about, oh, former President Biden's old, what the hell are we [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=183.12s)]
*  watching here? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=188.12s)]
*  So a reporter asked Donald Trump, what would you consider a substantial concession from [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=189.12s)]
*  China in your trade deals with China? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=195.72s)]
*  What do you want them to do? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=198.72s)]
*  Trump's response is, I want them to free it up. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=200.72s)]
*  Free up China. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=204.84s)]
*  They got to open up China. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=206.12s)]
*  They got to open it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=207.56s)]
*  That would be big. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=209.0s)]
*  I'm not sure if they can open it, but open it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=210.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=213.0s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=215.2s)]
*  What kind of movement do you consider substantial from China? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=216.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, free up China. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=222.67999999999998s)]
*  Let us go in and work China because frankly, that's what we wanted last time. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  We almost got in and then they backed out of that deal. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  But we had to go into China and sell our product, sell our wares. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  In other words, it's called open China. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=242.67999999999998s)]
*  That would be great. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=246.16s)]
*  That would be a big win. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=247.16s)]
*  Open it? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=248.16s)]
*  We were doing like $2 trillion annually in trade with China. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=250.16s)]
*  Now, the government officials in China, they are baffled by the United States behavior. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=254.16s)]
*  Now they are taking advantage of it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=261.16s)]
*  They're reaching out to Europe and Canada and Australia. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=263.16s)]
*  They're holding meetings in Africa and in South America and in Mexico. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=267.16s)]
*  They are reaching out across the globe to assert themselves as a counter to the United States. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=271.64000000000004s)]
*  And look, we're more stable than the United States is. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  But they're like, why is the United States want to bring in manufacturing jobs that we do in China [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=280.64000000000004s)]
*  when China is trying to emulate what the United States does? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump is not even paying attention to any world news at all. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=293.64000000000004s)]
*  He had no clue that there was an assassination of a Russian general today in Moscow [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=298.12s)]
*  and the guy's car exploded. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=303.12s)]
*  I don't want to even play this other clip of Trump. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=305.12s)]
*  So let me just read for you the transcript. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=308.12s)]
*  Mr. President, there was a car bomb in Moscow this morning that killed a Russian general. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=311.12s)]
*  Do you have any reaction to that? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=317.12s)]
*  Who killed what? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=319.12s)]
*  Who killed what? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=320.12s)]
*  Question. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=321.12s)]
*  A Russian general was killed in a car bomb. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=322.12s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=325.12s)]
*  Well, well, you're just telling me that for the first time. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=326.6s)]
*  Where did that take place? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=330.6s)]
*  I'm not sure why I'm doing a southern accent for Trump there, but whatever. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=331.6s)]
*  Question. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=334.6s)]
*  It took place in Moscow. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=335.6s)]
*  It was a Russian general. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=337.6s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=338.6s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, that's hitting close to home, right? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=339.6s)]
*  Whoa, that's a big one. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=342.6s)]
*  Yeah, I'll look at it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=344.6s)]
*  If I hear anything, I'll let you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=345.6s)]
*  If you hear any, this would be in your daily brief. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=347.6s)]
*  Do you even open it up? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=351.6s)]
*  No, because you're too busy golfing and prancing around Mar-a-Lago or the White House, throwing [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  around, whatever the most ridiculous conspiracy theories are. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=361.08000000000004s)]
*  Here a reporter asked Donald Trump, and I'll just play the audio of this, are you taking [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  Melania to dinner? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  It's her birthday. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  Or have you had time to get her a present? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=372.78000000000003s)]
*  And Trump goes, I have not had time to buy presents. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=376.28000000000003s)]
*  It's been busy, but it's working out. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=379.32000000000005s)]
*  People are loving the tariffs, he says. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=381.72s)]
*  They're loving it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=383.24s)]
*  They're loving it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=384.24s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=385.24s)]
*  Are you taking Melania to dinner? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=386.24s)]
*  Are you taking Mrs. Trump to dinner? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=387.24s)]
*  Or have you had time to get her a present? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=388.24s)]
*  You've been very busy. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=389.24s)]
*  I'll take her for dinner on the Boeing. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=390.24s)]
*  I'll take her for dinner on Air Force One. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=391.24s)]
*  I haven't had much time to buy presents. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=392.24s)]
*  We've been pretty busy. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=393.24s)]
*  But it's working out. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=394.24s)]
*  Things are working out very well. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=395.24s)]
*  And people are starting to understand how good tariffs are for us. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=396.24s)]
*  Okay, are they loving it? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=397.24s)]
*  Let's take a look at the New York Times, Sienna College poll. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=398.24s)]
*  By the way, I can show you the Reuters Ipsos poll. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=399.24s)]
*  I could show you the Fox poll. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=416.56s)]
*  I could show you the Pew Research poll. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=418.36s)]
*  They're all in this range right here. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  Trump's approval rating, 42%, 54% disapproved. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=423.04s)]
*  Pew Research, I think, was 40% approve. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=428.36s)]
*  And then it was, I think, like 57 disapprove right around there. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=431.36s)]
*  When it comes to immigration, Donald Trump is negative four. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=437.36s)]
*  Underwater immigration. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=442.36s)]
*  Managing the federal government, negative eight. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=444.36s)]

*  Foreign conflicts, negative 14. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=450.36s)]
*  The war between Russia and Ukraine, negative 21. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=452.36s)]
*  The case involving Abrego Garcia, negative 21. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=455.36s)]
*  Donald Trump was asked by Time magazine in an interview that was published earlier yesterday, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=459.36s)]
*  Donald, you said you would end the war in Ukraine on day one, but you didn't do it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=465.36s)]
*  Trump goes, well, I said that figuratively. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=469.36s)]
*  This is actually Trump's response. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=472.36s)]
*  I'm not paraphrasing. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=474.36s)]
*  I'm reading word for word Trump's response. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=475.36s)]
*  Well, I said that figuratively and I said that as an exaggeration because to make a point, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=478.36s)]
*  and you know it gets, of course, by the fake news. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=484.36s)]
*  Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=487.36s)]
*  It was said in jest. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=494.36s)]
*  I think we have the clip of you talking about it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=496.36s)]
*  Everybody, do you think this was in jest? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=498.36s)]
*  Was this one big joke? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=500.36s)]
*  Because that's what we expect, right? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=502.36s)]
*  The presidents of the United States to make jokes, to do funnies about creating peace in Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=504.36s)]
*  I must have lost the thread of humor here, Donald. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=512.36s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=515.36s)]
*  You would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=516.36s)]
*  Yes, I would. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=519.36s)]
*  How would you do that? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=520.36s)]
*  I know Zelensky very well. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=521.36s)]
*  I'll end that war between those two countries in 24 hours. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=523.36s)]
*  It won't even take that long. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=528.36s)]
*  I will get the war ended. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=530.36s)]
*  I'll stop all of those lives from being wasted and lost. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=532.36s)]
*  And there'll be no more bombing of Ukraine. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=537.36s)]
*  There'll be no more bombing of Russia. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=541.36s)]
*  And everybody will be happy. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=543.36s)]
*  And then on all the other fronts, as you're looking at the poll that I shared with you, and again, it's very similar to the other polls that are out there. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=545.36s)]
*  You have, let's just take a look at the data. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=552.36s)]
*  Now, lots of reporters are talking about it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=555.36s)]
*  Remember what we've been talking about on Midas? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=557.36s)]
*  Freight volumes, trucking volumes, down, down, down. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=559.36s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal headline today, finally. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=563.36s)]
*  Cargo shipments from China to US slide toward a standstill. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=567.36s)]
*  Cancellations accelerate. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=571.36s)]
*  Shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers has ceased. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=573.36s)]
*  The impact is staggering. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=579.36s)]
*  As Carl Kingtonia says, summer of scarcity. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=581.36s)]
*  So we've been saying summer of scarcity. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=584.36s)]
*  Folks, we're like a few weeks away from things not getting on shelves. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=586.36s)]
*  Remember how in COVID, there was no toilet paper and there was no things because the supply chains are broken. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=591.36s)]
*  It's worse than that right now. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=596.36s)]
*  If you look at the freight volumes and the shipping volumes and the trucking volumes, it's worse than COVID levels right now. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=598.36s)]
*  But folks, Donald Trump's focused on all the important things like what is wrong with this is what he posted. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=605.36s)]
*  What is wrong with the NFL owners? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=610.36s)]
*  Are they stupid? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=612.36s)]
*  Deon Sanders was a great college football player and was even greater in the NFL. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=613.36s)]
*  He's also a very good coach, streetwise and smart. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=617.36s)]
*  Therefore, Shador, his quarterback son, has phenomenal genes. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=620.36s)]
*  And is all set for greatness. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=624.36s)]
*  He should be picked immediately by a team that wants to win. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=625.36s)]
*  Win is in capitals. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=629.36s)]
*  Good luck, Shador. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=630.36s)]
*  And say hello to your wonderful father. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=631.36s)]
*  By the way, I'm sure that inspired teams to pick him earlier on. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=634.36s)]
*  Should talk about these two other stories. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=638.36s)]
*  Number one, we're learning about a federal judge who raised the alarm on Friday that the Trump regime appeared to have deported a two-year-old [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=641.36s)]
*  U.S. citizen to Honduras with no meaningful process, even as her father was fighting to keep her in the country. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=653.36s)]
*  As the judge said, in the interest of dispelling our strong suspicion that the government just deported a U.S. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=662.36s)]
*  citizen with no meaningful process, the court wants to know more. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=668.36s)]
*  The girl was deported Friday with her mother to Honduras, despite her father's efforts to keep her in the United States. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=674.36s)]
*  And then, of course, Donald Trump and his regime are bragging how they sent in the FBI to arrest a Milwaukee County Circuit Court judge named Judge [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=682.36s)]
*  Hannah Dugan. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=693.36s)]
*  She's a state court judge presiding over a case of an individual in her courtroom. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=694.36s)]
*  Last week, the feds wanted to arrest the guy in her courtroom. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=700.36s)]
*  Judge Dugan said, if you want to arrest the guy, do it outside, do it at his home, do it in the parking lot. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=705.36s)]
*  I'm a judge. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=712.36s)]
*  You don't come into my room and break in and run operations out of my courtroom. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=713.36s)]
*  I have to administer justice as a state court judge. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=718.36s)]
*  And then she said, I'm not going to help you do that. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=722.36s)]
*  We can coordinate with court services. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=725.36s)]
*  The feds said no. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=727.36s)]
*  She opened up her door. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=729.36s)]
*  The individual named Eduardo Ruiz went out. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=731.36s)]
*  He walked out and the feds arrested him later, but they charged the judge with obstruction for helping him escape her courtroom when in her courtroom [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=735.36s)]
*  she was administering justice. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=745.36s)]
*  The guy was accused of crimes in her courtroom. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=747.36s)]
*  She's a judge. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=749.36s)]
*  We have a process. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=750.36s)]
*  We don't have FBI do raids in buildings and send people to concentration camps. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=751.36s)]
*  And she's like, don't do this in my room. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=757.36s)]
*  Go do it somewhere else. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=758.36s)]
*  And the feds said, nope. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=760.36s)]
*  And now they are on Friday. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=761.36s)]
*  They cuffed the judge in her courtroom, which I could tell you as a lawyer is absolutely unprecedented. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=763.36s)]
*  The Trump regime is going to lose that case in federal court by far. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=770.36s)]
*  It's just a matter of time. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=775.36s)]
*  I can't even imagine what the federal judge is going to say to the Trump DOJ lawyer when they show up. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=776.36s)]
*  Horrific, horrific stuff. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=783.36s)]
*  Oh, finally, Trump is also throwing his other lawyers under the bus when he was asked about what's his reaction to the 9-0 Supreme Court ruling saying facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=785.36s)]
*  Trump said, that's not what my people told me. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=798.36s)]
*  They didn't say it was. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=800.36s)]
*  They said it was 9 to nothing, something entirely different. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=801.36s)]
*  My lawyers never said that to me. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=804.36s)]
*  And then a reporter from the Time magazine said, well, why haven't you asked Bukele to send Abrego back? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=806.36s)]
*  Trump goes, well, no one's asked me. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=813.36s)]
*  That's why nobody's asked me. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=815.36s)]
*  Going back to what I said at the beginning of this video, folks, I mean, there's a reason why. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=818.36s)]
*  What is it? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=825.36s)]
*  Only 27% of independents support this guy. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=826.36s)]
*  People are rising up. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=829.36s)]
*  People know what's going on in the economy. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=831.36s)]
*  People see that the economy was doing well in January before it was passed over to Donald Trump. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=834.36s)]
*  People know. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=841.36s)]
*  Trump thinks that he can just go ahead and lie and say all of this crap. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=842.36s)]
*  I mean, look, he's got his magma mush brain, zombified, Fox regime watching people. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=846.36s)]
*  He's got them. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=852.36s)]
*  But there's like 65, 70% of America now that is livid, livid, and rightfully so. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd7kS194JTo&t=853.36s)]
