# OMG! Trump RAGES WITH FEAR in AM as HIS Term COLLAPSES
**MeidasTouch:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc)
*  Donald Trump is having a disaster morning. He's attacking the United States Supreme Court [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=0.0s)]
*  after an oral argument regarding birthright citizenship where it appears the Trump regime [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=5.12s)]
*  is going to lose. Donald Trump is attacking Taylor Swift this morning. More on that in a bit. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=10.4s)]
*  Also, the discussions between Ukraine and Russia, as we predicted, blew up right away as Russia came [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=16.32s)]
*  in with ridiculous demands for Ukraine to basically fully surrender. We told you this was going to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=24.159999999999997s)]
*  happen after Donald Trump refused to show up to the negotiations in Turkey. Putin refused to show [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=30.24s)]
*  up to the negotiations in Turkey. Also, we're getting the new consumer sentiment data from the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=35.599999999999994s)]
*  University of Michigan, the lowest in American history since the pandemic, or the second lowest [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=40.64s)]
*  in history, the only time it was lower rather was since the pandemic. And we're also learning from [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=47.36s)]
*  Japan and the European Union that they're just going to be holding out and waiting for Donald [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=54.64s)]
*  Trump and trying to get better deals regarding the tariffs that Donald Trump placed on them [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  because they see that Donald Trump always caves. Donald Trump is a coward who always taps out in [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=67.12s)]
*  these negotiations. Let's just go through it one by one folks. Donald Trump posted the following [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=74.0s)]
*  this morning. The Supreme Court is being played by the radical left losers who have no support. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=78.64s)]
*  The public hates them and their only hope is the intimidation of the court itself. We can't let [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=84.0s)]
*  that happen to our country! He puts that all in caps as Trump's DOJ is literally threatening [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=89.52s)]
*  Democratic Congress members who have been assaulted by private security hired by the Trump regime [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  simply because Democrats are asking for answers about what the hell is going on in these migrant [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=103.92s)]
*  detention centers. Donald Trump is right here intimidating the United States Supreme Court. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=108.48s)]
*  He knows what he's doing and in fact the Supreme Court have reflected and have discussed Donald [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=113.68s)]
*  Trump's intimidation of the court. That's what he's doing and this is what he's spending his morning [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=118.56s)]
*  focused on as well. Donald Trump also posts the following. Has anyone noticed that since I said [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  I hate Taylor Swift she's no longer hot? Ladies and gentlemen, that's the United States president [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=129.68s)]
*  right now making a utter fool of our country. That's seriously a post. That's not AI, I'm not [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=136.72s)]
*  making that up. Right before he attacked the Supreme Court he attacks Taylor Swift. Has anyone [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=142.72s)]
*  noticed that since I said I hate Taylor Swift she is no longer hot? Is there a serious world [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  matters taking place right now? As I said earlier in this video Turkish and Ukrainian officials say [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=155.92s)]
*  that peace talks with Russia ended after less than two hours and one of the things that we note [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=162.0s)]
*  from a senior Ukrainian official that Russia was making unacceptable demands for Ukraine to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=168.64s)]
*  fully surrender. We told you that what Putin was doing in Istanbul was going to be a total [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=175.68s)]
*  setup from the outset even when Putin made the announcement last weekend that he said I want to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=182.88s)]
*  go to Turkey and I'm ready to have peace discussions. Remember all the videos we've made about it? We [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=188.0s)]
*  said look the reason Putin is doing that is because the European Union is about to impose sanctions [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=192.16s)]
*  and Putin's trying to delay delay delay and Putin wants to manipulate Donald Trump into saying that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=197.04s)]
*  he is trying his best to do peace negotiations but what really is happening here is that Putin and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=202.24s)]
*  Trump are trying to figure out how they meet just them two to try to go back to their original plan [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=208.32s)]
*  which in my opinion was Putin takes all of Ukraine Donald Trump steals the minerals of Ukraine for a [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=214.56s)]
*  sovereign wealth fund so Donald Trump can frolic in the Middle East with Qatari and Saudi and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=221.04s)]
*  Emirati royal families because that's really what makes Donald Trump feel the most comfortable when [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=227.52s)]
*  he's in his authoritarian element right there. As Carl Quintanilla describes this coverage of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=232.96s)]
*  Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East peak bromance coverage right you know the media kind [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=239.92s)]
*  of normalizes this behavior which is nothing short of despicable and disgusting. I mean take a look [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=245.6s)]
*  at the headline from Bloomberg Gold Palaces Jet deals and McDonald's Trump is at home in the Middle [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=252.0s)]
*  East look at Donald Trump and Crown Prince MBS during a signing ceremony when what they sign [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=259.36s)]
*  fake deals with each other it is not normal to see a United States president frolicking around [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=265.36s)]
*  in gold palaces having mobile McDonald's move to him while he tries to cut bribes for himself in the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  form of 400 million dollar gold plated 747 jets from the Qataris okay that does not make any sense [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=278.72s)]
*  at all and the headline should reflect it I mean the headline should say you know Donald Trump [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=286.72s)]
*  sells is how if I was in Bloomberg here's my headline Donald Trump sells out the United States [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=291.52s)]
*  in a you in the most humiliating foreign trip in American history that's how I would have [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=296.96s)]
*  wrote that headline here's the headline from Wall Street Journal he calls them handsome attractive [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=302.24s)]
*  tough Trump's bromance with Arab leaders what is this like Us Weekly right now the president has [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  used a trip to the Middle East to strengthen ties with Arab world leaders he's not strengthening [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=315.28s)]
*  ties to Arab world leaders he is taking bribes from Arab world leaders and you're the Wall Street [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=321.04s)]
*  Journal why don't you do an analysis a very simple one Wall Street Journal so let me help you here [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=326.88s)]
*  okay like in Qatar their entire annual GDP is 200 billion dollars okay so when Qatar signs a deal [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=332.88s)]
*  which you're calling it a deal which it's not a deal I'm putting it in quotes for 1.2 trillion [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=341.36s)]
*  dollars I could pretty much guarantee you that they're not giving away six times their annual [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=346.48s)]
*  GDP to the United States and then after you report that headlines let's follow through with what [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  actually is taken I'm really curious to see how that money is helping a factory worker in America [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  how is that money helping the American who psychologically tortured living paycheck to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=364.0s)]
*  paycheck during this moment right now how is that helping any American right now who can't afford a [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=369.12s)]
*  home those are the questions that I think you should be asking but I guess that's why people [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=374.88s)]
*  are coming to the Midas Touch Network regarding Donald Trump's claim of 90 deals in 90 days [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=379.12s)]
*  again as I told you from the outset when Donald Trump said that what did I say it's all BS it's [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=385.84s)]
*  all going to be phony fraud stuff so what Donald Trump's now said on his trip in the United Arab [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=390.64s)]
*  Emirates he goes they're coming back Trump indicates he will set tariff rates for other countries [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=397.04s)]
*  who have not done the deals with him over the next two to three weeks as the U.S. lacks capacity [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=402.64s)]
*  to negotiate with all other countries per Bloomberg as Carl Quintanilla says I don't think [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  we're getting those 90 deals in 90 days and as we said on the Midas Touch Network just wait another [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=414.56s)]
*  two weeks everybody because here's what Donald Trump said in Abu Dhabi by the way the Abu Dhabi [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  sovereign wealth fund is using two billion dollars of Trump family backed crypto in their [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=427.12s)]
*  transactions the same way the Qataris are building resorts in Qatar for Donald Trump and giving him [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  a 400 million dollar jet and the Saudis are building resorts as well in Oman and other places [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=440.4s)]
*  for Donald Trump but here Donald Trump says we have 150 countries now he just makes up numbers [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=446.48s)]
*  150 countries want to make a deal but you see if they don't make deals I'm just going to set the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=452.16s)]
*  deals myself so that's going to be the deals I'm going to make them myself because nobody wants [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=458.08000000000004s)]
*  to do deals with you Donald here play this clip we just reached a fantastic trade deal as you know [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  with the United Kingdom which was wonderful and we have another big one that we just reached with [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=469.44000000000005s)]
*  China China deals a very big deal it's in the process of continuing to be formed [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=476.0s)]
*  but they wanted to make that deal very badly and we have at the same time 150 countries that [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=483.84s)]
*  want to make a deal but you're not able to see that many countries so at a certain point over [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=491.76s)]
*  the next two to three weeks I think Scott and Howard will be sending letters out essentially [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=495.6s)]
*  telling people it would be very fair but we'll be telling people what they'll be paying to do [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=501.52s)]
*  business in the United States so essentially be paying to be doing business in the United States [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  I guess you could say they could appeal it but for the most part I think we're going to be very [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=514.24s)]
*  fair but it's not it's not possible to meet the number of people that want to see us and but this [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=518.0799999999999s)]
*  coming to UAE was very important coming to Saudi Arabian Qatar was very important to me because of [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=525.44s)]
*  personal relationships that I had maybe more than anything else the weather is heating up and your [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDFurtL4wc&t=533.12s)]
