# Trump gets PUBLICLY SHAMED by ENTIRE WORLD
**MeidasTouch:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I)
*  The rest of the world is disgusted, revolted at, laughing at, depending on if you're our adversary, the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump looks like a little pathetic cornered rat right now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=8.92s)]
*  No offense to pathetic cornered rats who have more dignity than Donald Trump. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=12.3s)]
*  So Trump's chief propagandist, Caroline Levitt, begging. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=17.1s)]
*  What does Donald Trump say? Begging like a dog, right? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=22.1s)]
*  She's begging China, please give Donald Trump a call. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=25.2s)]
*  Please, can you please call him? The ball's in your court. He's waiting for your call. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=29.0s)]
*  Watch this pathetic display of weakness by Caroline Levitt at yesterday's press conference play this clip. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=33.3s)]
*  The president has made his position on China quite clear. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=40.4s)]
*  Although I do have an additional statement that he just shared with me in the Oval Office. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=44.2s)]
*  The ball is in China's court. China needs to make a deal with us. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=48.8s)]
*  We don't have to make a deal with them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=53.3s)]
*  There's no difference between China and any other country except they are much larger. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=55.4s)]
*  And China wants what we have, what every country wants, what we have, the American consumer. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=60.099999999999994s)]
*  Or to put it another way, they need our money. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=66.89999999999999s)]
*  So the president, again, has made it quite clear that he's open to a deal with China, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=69.7s)]
*  but China needs to make a deal with the United States of America. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=73.5s)]
*  You know, at the same time that was taking place, a top Hong Kong official was saying to the Trump regime, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=76.1s)]
*  Hey, you want to call us peasants? Let me tell you what's really going on here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=84.5s)]
*  You're never going to take down China. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=89.7s)]
*  I mean, didn't the Trump regime say, oh, we're out maneuvering China here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=91.7s)]
*  We this is what we're doing here. Play this clip. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=96.5s)]
*  The chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region said Hong Kong is the largest trade surplus region for the United States. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=100.5s)]
*  But the United States still imposes such tariffs on Hong Kong, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=108.0s)]
*  which is simply outrageous, overbearing and shameless. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=112.4s)]
*  This makes the world see more clearly that the United States cannot stand seeing Hong Kong doing well [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=116.2s)]
*  and is the biggest disruptor of Hong Kong's human rights, freedom, legal order and prosperity stability. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=123.4s)]
*  It's not after our taxes, but our lives. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=130.3s)]
*  The United States repeatedly suppresses Hong Kong, which will only lead to the accelerated demise of its agents in Hong Kong [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=135.0s)]
*  and ultimately backfire on itself. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=146.4s)]
*  Let those American bumpkins wail in front of the 5,000 year old civilization of the Chinese nation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=150.0s)]
*  And great job, Donald, because yesterday Hong Kong announced that it would be suspending all of its postal service to the United States [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=159.5s)]
*  after Trump's tariff hikes. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=168.8s)]
*  Hong Kong Post, the postal service in the semi-autonomous Chinese city, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=171.1s)]
*  is going to stop handling packages coming from or going to the US amid an escalating trade war. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=175.9s)]
*  In a statement published Wednesday announcing the decision, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=182.4s)]
*  the government of Hong Kong cited Trump's decision last week to eliminate the so-called de minimis exception [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=185.9s)]
*  for postal items sent from the city to the US. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=192.9s)]
*  The US is unreasonable bullying and imposing tariffs abusively, the government said in the statement. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=196.10000000000002s)]
*  The public in Hong Kong should be prepared to pay exorbitant and unreasonable fees due to the US. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=203.4s)]
*  Unreasonable and bullying acts, it goes on to say. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=210.10000000000002s)]
*  The postal service will stop accepting packages transported by sea with an immediate effect [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=213.4s)]
*  and stop taking airborne packages starting from April 27th, the Hong Kong government said in a statement. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=218.9s)]
*  So all of those products that Americans rely on from some of the all the websites that are based in Hong Kong, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=226.10000000000002s)]
*  all of those products, you ain't getting them no more and stuff's about to get way more expensive. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=232.70000000000002s)]
*  Great work, Donald. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  Real brilliant move, Donald. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  Let me just give us the facts as well. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=241.5s)]
*  So China has suspended sending rare earth minerals to the United States as well, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=243.6s)]
*  which is used in everything right now from computers to phones, you name it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=248.8s)]
*  They're not selling it to the United States. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=255.3s)]
*  Now the Trump regime thinks that it's being smart by preventing Nvidia from selling one of its chips back to China [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=257.0s)]
*  after the Trump regime has raised tariffs on China to 145%, which China just said is absolutely laughable at this point. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=266.7s)]
*  Well, now Donald Trump is killing an American company and also further tanking the stock market again. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=275.2s)]
*  Trump has no clue what he is doing and he is being laughed at and mocked by our adversaries. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=281.0s)]
*  And at this point, our allies or our former allies were like, we're not messing around with the US no more. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=287.4s)]
*  They're crazy. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=293.09999999999997s)]
*  They're revolted. They're disgusted. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=294.6s)]
*  For all of Donald Trump's love of Putin and Russia, this is what is on loop right now on Russian propaganda TV. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=296.90000000000003s)]
*  Let me share with you, we've translated this in AI as well, the voice, so you can hear it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=304.5s)]
*  This is what they're playing on loop right now on Russia TV, which of course gets the blessing from Putin to play this over and over again. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=309.1s)]
*  But at the same time, we must understand in two months, he will be 79 years old [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=316.20000000000005s)]
*  and he differs from Biden in that his dementia manifests differently. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=321.1s)]
*  That is true verbal diarrhea and the need to show his internal audience every day that he is a super macho. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=325.5s)]
*  He needs great victories, spectacular ones. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=331.6s)]
*  We even created the Trump verbal bingo. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=335.1s)]
*  Yes, today was a great day. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=337.6s)]
*  I had a brilliant conversation with so and so showed him our coolest weapon that only America has thanks to the fact that the president Trump, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=339.4s)]
*  I gave him an ultimatum. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=347.2s)]
*  It's a dire ultimatum. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  If he doesn't immediately accept my deal terms, things will be very bad for him. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=349.3s)]
*  Well, most likely it will be good because we'll reach an agreement tomorrow. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=352.90000000000003s)]
*  But if we don't agree, it will be even worse for him because we have super weapons. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=356.3s)]
*  I am a cool president. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=359.8s)]
*  It feels like his speech. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=360.6s)]
*  They elected Trump. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=361.90000000000003s)]
*  I'm great. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=362.8s)]
*  I understand who writes his speeches for him. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=363.3s)]
*  So let me get this straight. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=365.3s)]
*  So Donald Trump sends his top envoy, Steve Witkoff, who's just like a like a real estate guy from New York, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=367.3s)]
*  who's now the chief negotiator with Putin. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=375.5s)]
*  Witkoff puts his hand on his heart and says Vladimir, Vladimir. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=378.1s)]
*  Two days later, Vladimir Putin sends two ballistic missiles into the city of Sumy in Ukraine, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=383.2s)]
*  killing 35 innocent Ukrainians, injuring 120 Ukrainians who were out for Palm Sunday celebrating with their families by a church. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=390.4s)]
*  Then Donald Trump spends the entire week kissing Putin's ass. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=401.6s)]
*  You know how Donald Trump uses that term. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=405.5s)]
*  They're kissing my ass. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=406.90000000000003s)]
*  No one's kissing your ass, Donald. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=407.8s)]
*  You're kissing Putin's ass, attacking Zelensky, blaming Zelensky for Putin's unlawful invasion of Ukraine. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=409.20000000000005s)]
*  And what does he get in return? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, I guess Donald, at least Putin isn't showing the nudes of Melania again. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  Remember after Trump won the election, Putin was playing on loop nudes of Melania to mock Trump. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=423.8s)]
*  But now this is what you're getting on Russia TV. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=430.1s)]
*  And so that's why I want to show you all what's really going on because corporate news ain't going to show you that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=433.5s)]
*  Let me show you a corporate news ain't going to show you either. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=438.5s)]
*  So a video that was made by Lars Dammtchar from Greenland and this is going crazy viral right now in Greenland. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=441.1s)]
*  A message to the people of America from 97 percent of Greenland. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=452.0s)]
*  Here, watch this. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=456.8s)]
*  American friends, you voted to put America first. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=458.3s)]
*  How did that turn out? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=462.6s)]
*  Inflation is up. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=464.3s)]
*  The market is down. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=465.8s)]
*  Eggs are still 10 bucks. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=467.3s)]
*  And Ebola prevention? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, don't worry about that. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=472.3s)]
*  Meanwhile, the administration is obsessed with annexing Greenland. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=474.0s)]
*  Instead of helping Americans keep their homes, your politicians are trying to take ours. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=478.0s)]
*  Instead of making Americans feel safe, your politicians are making your neighbors fear. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=483.2s)]
*  Do us both a favor. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=488.59999999999997s)]
*  Tell your representatives to actually put America first. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=489.9s)]
*  We don't need this kind of attention, but America does. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=493.2s)]
*  This episode of the Midas Touch podcast is brought to you by Wild Grain. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=497.5s)]

*  And this at the same time, the European Union expects US tariffs to stay as talks make little progress. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=581.1s)]
*  The European Union and the US made scant progress bridging trade differences this week as officials from Donald Trump's administration indicated that the bulk of the US tariffs imposed on the European Union will not be removed. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=589.2s)]
*  European Union negotiators, I was watching what their foreign with their head of foreign negotiations or trade their trade minister said from the EU. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=607.1s)]
*  Like we don't understand the intentions of the Trump administration. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=615.8s)]
*  Like it literally makes no sense to us. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=620.8s)]
*  As Vuku Capital bloke says, the most obvious and simple proof there is no plan. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=623.8s)]
*  So America is now in a full on trade war, unprecedented in scope with China. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=629.4s)]
*  So now the US is asking countries to take its side saying it's our side or China's side. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=634.9s)]
*  We need you to stand with us. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=641.3s)]

*  The order of operation makes literally no sense. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=647.5s)]
*  It's indefensible. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=650.8s)]
*  That's what the US is saying. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=651.6999999999999s)]

*  Meanwhile, Caroline Levitt today during her propaganda stupid press conference in the Oval Office again attack Canada and said we want to make Canada the 51st state play this clip. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=656.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=669.3s)]
*  I'm tariffs yesterday in the Oval Office. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=669.6999999999999s)]
*  Which outlet are you? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=672.3s)]
*  The Canadian Public Broadcaster. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=673.2s)]
*  Nice to see you. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=674.8000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=675.6s)]
*  Yesterday in the Oval Office President Trump suggested that there could be some help for automakers. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=676.3000000000001s)]
*  I'm wondering what that looks like. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=681.4000000000001s)]
*  Is it tariff relief on the 25% tariffs that are in place right now or the new tariffs that are coming up in May on auto parts and a second on Canada if I may President Trump's tone when it comes to Canada US relations Canadians have noticed it's shifted a bit in the past few weeks. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=683.0s)]
*  Ever since the election campaign started he stopped talking about Canada becoming the 51st state at least publicly. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=699.9s)]
*  I'm wondering if that's on purpose and why I would reject the president's position on Canada has shifted. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=705.8s)]
*  Perhaps he just hasn't been asked about Canada by questions from this group in the Oval Office but they see him almost every day. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=711.6s)]
*  But the president still maintains his position on Canada. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=717.8s)]
*  The United States has been subsidizing Canada's national defense and he believes that Canadians would benefit greatly from becoming the 51st state of the United States of America. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=720.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=730.0s)]
*  So there's a reason now why when the US is giving the world an ultimatum US or China you pick. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=730.7s)]
*  Why would they pick the why would they pick you? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=739.5s)]
*  You're a crazy. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=742.3000000000001s)]
*  But you're literally a crazy person. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=743.1s)]
*  I mean there were multiple trilateral bilateral trade agreements that former President Obama and Biden entered into with Japan with South Korea with countries in Southeast Asia with Europe elsewhere to try to address all of these things like like but even Donald. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=745.5s)]
*  I'm not trying to give Donald credit for anything because he literally just repackaged NAFTA and called it the United States Mexican trade agreement the USMCTA the USMTA you know so he repackaged that but now what's Donald Trump doing today. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=768.4s)]
*  Now just going after Mexico the US Commerce Department on Monday said most tomatoes imported from Mexico to the United States will now face duties of 20.91% from July 14th as it withdraws from an agreement. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=784.3s)]
*  It said failed to protect domestic tomato growers. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=797.4s)]
*  Okay, but did your agreement these are like a lot of this stuff is dating back to free trade agreements that Trump put in place that was refined under Biden but this was these were some of your agreements there Donald so no wonder the United States economies losing tens of billions of dollars on tourism Canada led the path they said to the world. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=801.0s)]
*  Why would we go to the US boycott the US boycott US products Europe is doing that as well right now. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=822.8s)]
*  We're seeing that and and by the way we're seeing China by Australian beef we're seeing China put its cars electric vehicle BYD's into Europe people not buying Tesla's in Europe anymore this Trump tariffs been an unmitigated disaster of the Trump banning the video from sending the chips. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=829.3000000000001s)]
*  Into China which are kind of reduced effective chips based on what what the former Biden administration required that's going to cause the video a 5.5 billion dollar right down right now I mean Trump's taking a freaking sledgehammer and wrecking everything. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=848.9s)]
*  Oh and by the way talking about mocking the United States let me share with you these two videos right here and there's hundreds of videos like this on tick tock which are basically people in China saying you're calling us peasants watch this. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=866.3s)]
*  Honesty loyalty and kindness maybe we didn't have a chance to go to top schools but don't confuse neck of opportunity with neck of intelligence because when we do get a chance we become the ones building your AI chips in Silicon Valley. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=896.9s)]
*  Leading global tech companies and pushing the edge of innovation. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=913.8000000000001s)]
*  Well you are busy labeling us we are busy building high-speed trains world leading 5G networks and space programs that make headlines around the world you used an outdated word with an outdated mindset to describe a country you clearly don't understand. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=918.6999999999999s)]
*  And here's the twist the peasants you mock they are also one of your biggest creditors trying to hold a big chunk of US debt so yeah the peasants you talk down to you actually owe them. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=936.9s)]
*  So the next time before you speak ask yourself this what kind of leader mocked people for being hardworking and honest isn't that more of a reflection on you than on them. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=951.4s)]
*  In our culture peasants means roots the strong roots that hold up a nation reaching for the stars. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=962.9s)]
*  That's what they're saying in China right now here play this clip. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=992.9s)]
*  So here's the smoke screen to cover up what he actually is doing but from Chinese people or Chinese government's perspective what Donald Trump is doing is uniting China is making China looking really good on an international stage. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=1023.6999999999999s)]
*  And China didn't even have to invent anything because Donald Trump already did what they can never imagine like it's beyond their wildest dream. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=1041.5s)]
*  So yeah to Chinese people that's a very patriotic behavior so we gave him the name Chuan Jian Guo. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=1052.5s)]
*  Well that's what the world thinks about us now. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_DXNWuLZ1I&t=1059.5s)]
