Video Description: Trump's latest meltdown hits new authoritarian lows—and the week is just getting started. On this episode of the MeidasTouch Podcast, we break down the madness: Trump’s so-called “economic plan” includes rationing dolls for little girls, jacking up prices, and telling working families to “shut up.” He floated imaginary trade deals, demanded tariffs on Hollywood movies, posted a bizarre AI image of himself as the Pope, and called for reopening Alcatraz. Oh, and he partied with the Proud Boys at Mar-a-Lago, questioned if he has to uphold the Constitution, and proposed gutting 20% of four-star generals. Meanwhile, a huge pro-democracy win in Australia where the Labor Party crushed it—ALBOWS UP, mates. Buckle up—Ben, Brett and Jordy discuss it all.
