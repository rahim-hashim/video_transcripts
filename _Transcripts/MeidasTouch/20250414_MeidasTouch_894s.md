# Trump has AWFUL LANDING to DC as he LOSES IT
**MeidasTouch:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs)
*  It's just pure lunacy in the Trump regime. So, Donald Trump just returned to Washington, D.C. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=0.0s)]
*  after taking yet another vacation in Florida on the taxpayer dime where he golfed and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=6.0s)]
*  partied with the billionaire oligarchs. As he was landing in Washington, D.C., he started making [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=12.56s)]
*  deranged social media posts after deranged social media posts. He also attacked President Zelensky [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=18.64s)]
*  of Ukraine and former President Biden. This as Donald Trump sent his special envoy, Steve Wittkopf, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=24.8s)]
*  to go to St. Petersburg and put his hand over his heart and essentially pledge allegiance to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=31.92s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. Let's take a look at what Donald Trump's just been posting. He posts the following. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=38.0s)]
*  All in caps, he goes, the best definition of intelligence is the ability to predict the future. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  I mean, literally, it's the ranting and ravings of a madman. But if you want to talk about [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=50.0s)]
*  intelligence, Donald, now when European Union ambassadors and diplomats show up in the United [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=53.84s)]
*  States, they're all using burner phones and they're preparing as if they were in an authoritarian [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=58.88s)]
*  regime, like when they visit China or when they used to visit Russia. They're getting burner phones [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  and they're taking steps as though the United States is an adversary. That's how they're treating [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  their visits right now. Then Donald Trump posts the following. Congratulations to Rory. What a great [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=76.56s)]
*  job he did. Tremendous courage and talent was on full display at yesterday's Masters. What a win! [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=83.12s)]
*  He's referring to Rory McElroy, who won the Masters golf event. I wouldn't exactly say courage. I [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=91.28s)]
*  mean, courage, I would use that word for somebody like President Zelensky. I would say it was a [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  good golf match. Congratulations. But I don't know, Donald, maybe you should be addressing, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=103.44s)]
*  I don't know the fact that the Jewish governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was targeted [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=108.64s)]
*  for an assassination attempt and his residence was burned in an arson attack. And now we're [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=113.44s)]
*  learning that the arsonist brought a hammer to try to kill Governor Shapiro. You don't address that, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=119.92s)]
*  huh? No thoughts on that, Donald. Well, actually, when Donald Trump was on Air Force One heading [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=126.0s)]
*  back to Washington, D.C., he was asked about the assassination attempt against Governor Shapiro [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=131.92s)]
*  of Pennsylvania. And Donald Trump doesn't say anything about it other than I just heard about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=138.39999999999998s)]
*  it. So Donald Trump has spent the weekend watching the Masters, talking about the Masters, talking [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=143.76s)]
*  about his bogus health report. I'm going to do a whole hot take on that where it says he weighs [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=149.27999999999997s)]
*  like 230 pounds and that as evidence of his good health, he wins all of these golf tournaments. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=154.72s)]
*  That's literally what it says on his physical that was just released. But here's what Donald [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=161.04s)]
*  Trump says when he's asked about Shapiro. Play this clip. Did you get any reaction to the governor [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=165.44s)]
*  of Pennsylvania, his mansion, set on fire? Did you get any reaction? I just heard about it. No, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=169.76s)]
*  I have to look into it. You got the perfect health report. All of our, all, everybody in the press [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=173.68s)]
*  wants to know this. How do you do it, Mr. President? I haven't set up the two AM. Here was [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump's post at 9, 12 AM this morning. He goes, the war between Russia and Ukraine is [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=183.2s)]
*  Biden's war, not mine. Just pause there for a second. What a deranged thing to say. You are [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=189.76s)]
*  the leader, unfortunately, right now of the United States. You enabled Putin to do this in your first [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=195.92s)]
*  administration. But who goes? That's someone else's war, not mine. That's the mind of a malignant [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  narcissist. Donald Trump then goes on to say, I just got here and for years during my term had no [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=209.2s)]
*  problem in preventing it from happening. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, you know, that you have to be [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=215.52s)]
*  the president of the United States. You were the one who ran on that you were going to create peace [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=220.72s)]
*  in Ukraine in 24 hours. Now it's not my war. I just got here. This is the, again, no offense to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  petulant babies. This is not the behavior of a leader at any level. This is not leadership at all, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  yet alone the biggest position of leadership, which is in the White House. And it's not to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=240.08s)]
*  mention that Donald Trump's a sexual predator, a felon, and someone found liable for fraud. But [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  don't even get me started on that rant. Then Donald Trump goes on to say, President Putin and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=250.88000000000002s)]
*  everyone else respected your president, right? So Trump's saying positive things about Putin. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=256.48s)]
*  I had nothing to do with this war. This is all caps, but I'm working diligently to get the death [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=261.68s)]
*  and destruction to stop. Pause. You promised on day one that it was going to be solved. Peace in [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=266.88s)]
*  Ukraine. You said as soon as you won, there would be peace in Ukraine. And you've made things worse, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=271.84s)]
*  exponentially worse. Then Donald Trump goes on to say, if the 2020 presidential election was not [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=276.48s)]
*  rigged and it was in so many ways that horrible war would never have happened. Pause. So here we are, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=282.56s)]
*  April 14th. Donald Trump's regime is kidnapping and disappearing migrants on the street, sending [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=289.6s)]
*  them to concentration camps in El Salvador. Well, then Trump takes vacations every weekend to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=296.0s)]
*  Florida. He's whining about the 2020 election, saying that it's rigged, which it is not saying [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=302.0s)]
*  it's not my war. I have nothing to do with any of this. And then he goes on to say, President [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=308.24s)]
*  Zelensky and crooked Joe Biden did an absolutely horrible job in allowing this travesty to begin. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=313.44s)]
*  There are so many ways of preventing it from ever starting, but that is the past. Now we have to get [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=320.4s)]
*  it to stop and fast. So sad. What a despicable, vile piece of crap Donald Trump is. I mean, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=325.52s)]
*  truly a piece of trash who deserves none of our respect. He is a piece of freaking trash, period. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  Full stop. You're blaming President Zelensky and Ukraine from having their country unlawfully [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=340.4s)]
*  invaded. You despicable, vile thing. You, you get no respect from democracy loving Americans. You [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  piece of crap. You sorry. That just makes me absolutely livid. But what Donald Trump did [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=354.88s)]
*  want to talk about on the airplane while he land was that the Masters, he loves the Masters. He [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=361.04s)]
*  loves watching golf. He loves why he's so healthy. He loves watching golf here. Play this clip. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  No, no, I wanted to watch. There was no way, even for you people, there was no way that was it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=371.52s)]
*  It's one of my favorite shows ever. The Masters is to me, maybe my favorite [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=378.08s)]
*  sporting show. Justin Rose was great. They're great athletes under tremendous pressure. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=382.64s)]
*  But unless you're a golfer, you don't understand. It's a hundredth of an inch makes a difference [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=393.84s)]
*  between a great shot and a horrible shot. Think of it, just a little tiny, a little small percentage [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=398.32s)]
*  of an inch. And literally in some cases, a hundredth of an inch is the difference between winning and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=405.76s)]
*  losing. So you ever wake up and feel like your body just hit the snooze button on life? Yeah, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=412.32s)]

*  workout, I just don't bounce back the way that I used to. One day you're full of energy. The next [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=423.59999999999997s)]

*  just hang around after they've stopped doing their job, draining your energy and making you feel, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=443.6s)]
*  well, old. Think joint discomfort, sluggish recovery, low energy, the whole deal. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=448.48s)]

*  Let's talk about what Donald Trump did when he landed. He invited Naid Boukeli, the authoritarian [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=496.88s)]
*  leader from El Salvador to the White House today, gave him a grand, dull welcome, a hero's welcome. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=502.64000000000004s)]
*  One of the poorest countries in Latin America with a GDP of $28 billion, a poverty rate of about 25%, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=509.20000000000005s)]
*  extreme poverty of about 10%. Oh, by the way, Naid Boukeli, where's your suit? I thought all [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=518.72s)]
*  the MAGA Republicans say you got to wear suit and tie in the Oval Office. You're not exactly a wartime [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=525.04s)]
*  president. I mean, Zelinsky is a wartime hero. You're showing up there, what, bringing kidnapped [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=530.56s)]
*  Americans into your concentration camps? And this is who Donald Trump respects, one of the poorest [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=536.56s)]
*  Latin American countries. So it's like him and Donald Trump loves Javier Malay. But yeah, we [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=543.12s)]
*  screwed over wealthy nations in Europe and our allies in Canada, wealthy allies in Canada and [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=548.72s)]
*  Australia. We attacked them. But it's good to know that Donald Trump is bros with Naid Boukeli, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=554.88s)]
*  who has the highest incarceration rate per capita any country in the world and is an impoverished [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=561.12s)]
*  country. But let's go and pretend that El Salvador is exactly what America should be. In fact, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=567.12s)]
*  that's what Trump is turning America into. So Kristi Noem, Donald Trump's Homeland Security [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=572.08s)]
*  Secretary, who kills her dogs, who does all the cosplay photos when she remembers she showed up [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=577.6800000000001s)]
*  also to El Salvador with her $60,000 Rolex in front of like the half-naked men. And she was like, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=583.2800000000001s)]
*  just like, we'll put you in these jails. We'll put you in this concentration camp. Here she is talking [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=590.4000000000001s)]
*  about the partnership with Boukeli. That's the partnership with Boukeli in the concentration [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=596.24s)]
*  camps. Here play this clip. Terry, this meeting between the El Salvadorian president and President [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=600.96s)]
*  Donald Trump, does that indicate that the flights will continue, that the deportation, that you guys [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=605.6s)]
*  aren't going to allow the courts to stop you? Well, I think the conversation is going to be [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=610.4000000000001s)]
*  extremely beneficial. El Salvador has been a fantastic partner. And when I was in El Salvador [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=614.4000000000001s)]
*  visiting with President Boukeli, we talked about the fact that he would accept more flights, would [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  accept more individuals into CICOT. So I'm looking forward to that partnership continuing. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=623.2800000000001s)]
*  Secretary Christie, thank you so much for joining the program. Yes. Thank you, Lawrence. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=628.48s)]
*  Appreciate it. All right, Christie, if it's a partnership then in these concentration camps, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=631.92s)]
*  then partnership should be bring back the migrants like the Supreme Court ordered with [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=637.68s)]
*  Abrego Garcia. The Supreme Court ordered, I've done a million hot takes on a million. I've done [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=643.04s)]
*  several hot takes on it. We talked about it on Legal AF. It was a nine to zero ruling from the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=648.16s)]
*  Supreme Court saying, return Abrego Garcia, one of the migrants who was kidnapped, who has [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=653.28s)]
*  disappeared to the El Salvador concentration camp, who the Trump regime admits in their filings, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=659.12s)]
*  was sent to El Salvador in error, which now the Trump regime says they're not going to do. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=665.12s)]
*  And here they have Stephen Miller today. This is their messaging. And I talked about it earlier [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=670.8s)]
*  in my hot takes this morning in the videos I did where they're saying, we're not following the [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=675.68s)]
*  Supreme Court's ruling saying, return Abrego Garcia in the most dystopian or wellian way. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=679.92s)]
*  They're now saying the Supreme Court didn't actually rule that. The Trump regime says, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=685.12s)]
*  we won. It was a nine to zero ruling that we won saying Abrego Garcia stays in El Salvador, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=689.5999999999999s)]
*  when literally the ruling said the opposite. It said, return Abrego Garcia, facilitate his [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=695.5999999999999s)]
*  return immediately. The district court said, do it immediately. Now the Trump regime's like, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=700.88s)]
*  what are you talking about? The Supreme Court said we were the winners. They said, keep Abrego [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=706.32s)]
*  Garcia in El Salvador. Here, watch this. Your argument is that you don't have to bring him [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=711.28s)]
*  back home, but will you? So I want to correct. I hate to do it, Bill, but I got to correct you [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=715.52s)]
*  on every single thing that you said, because it was all wrong. First, we won the Supreme Court case. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=721.52s)]
*  Clearly nine zero. A district court judge said, unconscionably, that the president and his [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=727.92s)]
*  administration have to go into El Salvador and extradite one of their citizens, an El Salvadorian [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=734.64s)]
*  citizen. So that would be kidnapping. That we have to kidnap an El Salvadorian citizen against the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=740.3199999999999s)]
*  will of his government and fly him back to America, which would be an unimaginable act and invasion of [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=745.12s)]
*  El Salvador sovereignty. So we appealed to the Supreme Court and it said clearly no district [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=751.36s)]
*  court can compel the president to exercise his Article Two foreign powers in any way whatsoever. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=756.56s)]
*  DOJ called me after that Supreme Court ruling and they said, this is amazing. We won this case, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=763.12s)]
*  nine zero. We are an excellent standing here. So this has been portrayed wrong for 72 hours. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=767.36s)]
*  And totally, totally deranged. You want to see what's going on though in international diplomacy. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=772.24s)]
*  You have China and Vietnam with a major diplomatic meeting today. Xi Jinping met with the leader of [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=777.28s)]
*  Vietnam. They signed dozens of cooperation deals on Monday, including on production and supply [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=783.04s)]
*  chains as well as railway cooperation. As Chinese president, Xi Jinping, visit the Southeast nation, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=788.8s)]
*  footage of the signed documents seen by Reuters showed. And then Xi Jinping talked about how they [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=794.8s)]
*  need to stand up against other unilateral bullies in the world. Goldman Sachs is saying the prospects [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=800.4799999999999s)]
*  of a recession have increased. Goldman CEO says hearing a greater sense of short-term concern [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=806.88s)]
*  from CEOs outside the U.S. Oh, and one other thing that I'll mention too is you have [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=812.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's post last night where he attacked 60 minutes and CBS and then directed his FCC [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=818.64s)]
*  commissioner to take away CBS's broadcast license. He said he's directing Brendan Carr to take away [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=825.76s)]
*  CBS's broadcast license because he didn't like what 60 minutes was playing last night, the 60 [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=833.4399999999999s)]
*  minutes show. You know what the 60 minute show last night was on? It had president Zelensky [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=839.36s)]
*  mourning the deaths of Ukrainian kids who were killed. That's what was on 60 minutes. That's [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=844.5600000000001s)]
*  what triggered Donald Trump to write that message. An utterly despicable, vile trash human being. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=849.76s)]
*  I'm not going to hold back my words about what I think about him and what I think about the people [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=858.48s)]
*  who surround him seriously. I mean, you judge for yourself based on the facts. I'm Ben Mycelis. This [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNL71x3RPs&t=863.12s)]
