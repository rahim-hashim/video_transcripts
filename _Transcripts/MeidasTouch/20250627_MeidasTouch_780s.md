# Trump & Fox BLINDSIDED by MOTHER OF ALL LAWSUITS
**MeidasTouch:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI)
*  A $787 million lawsuit has been filed against Fox by California Governor Gavin Newsom for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=0.0s)]
*  defamation misrepresenting the communications which took place between California Governor [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=9.36s)]
*  Gavin Newsom and Donald Trump. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=16.12s)]
*  Governor Newsom was very clear about when a phone call took place when Donald Trump. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=18.44s)]
*  Trump several days later lied and said, oh, there was a phone call that took place the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  day before when it didn't take place the day before. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=27.6s)]
*  Let's bring in California Governor Gavin Newsom to talk about what happened and how Fox really [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=30.32s)]
*  being this propaganda arm for Donald Trump, editing and manipulating the videos and the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  content to give their viewers false information. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=42.28s)]
*  This is one of the basis of your lawsuit. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=45.92s)]
*  Talk about your lawsuit, Governor. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  No, I appreciate it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think you summed it up beautifully. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  I mean, they knowingly misrepresented the facts. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=51.24s)]
*  They altered and edited statements of the President of the United States videos and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=53.96s)]
*  they knowingly stated that I lied about a phone call with Donald Trump. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=59.08s)]
*  Donald Trump, as we know, lied about a phone call he had with me the day before. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=64.8s)]
*  That call, in fact, was almost four days prior. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=69.48s)]
*  Trump himself went to John Roberts of Fox to show a screenshot of the call. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  That call was never in question. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=79.02000000000001s)]
*  They went on then to alter the fact that the president said it was a call the day before [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  and then it was weaponized further on the Jesse Water Show who had a chyron saying Gavin [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=86.92s)]
*  lied about President Trump. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=92.48s)]
*  And so look, I can take it these guys go after me 24-7. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=94.68s)]
*  I'm a pi√±ata and have been for years and years at Fox. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=98.84s)]
*  Never once did I think I had to file a defamation lawsuit. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  But this crossed the line, the journalistic and ethical lines, the boundaries of defamation, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=107.28s)]
*  malice, and they need to be held to account because it's one thing to cover up for the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  lies of a president, but the impact of covering up for these lies is impacting our democracy, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=119.12s)]
*  truth and trust. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=127.0s)]
*  Governor, look, when it comes to, you know, when I speak to my wife, sometimes I'll say [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=128.0s)]
*  five minutes, 10 minutes, and it'll be 20 minutes. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=132.56s)]
*  It won't be five minutes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=135.36s)]
*  That's relatively inconsequential, although she'll may view it differently. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=137.28s)]
*  When we're talking about issues of war, when we're talking about issues of sending troops [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=141.8s)]
*  into a state in an unprecedented fashion, clarity and honesty, I think, matters the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=148.8s)]
*  absolute most. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=156.52s)]
*  So when a conversation took place, how long it took place, this is important because people [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  can die. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=163.8s)]
*  So you as the governor of California were very clear. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=165.0s)]
*  You said it to us when you were talking about it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=167.88s)]
*  There was a phone call that took place. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=169.8s)]
*  Here's how long it is. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  Trump then makes up a fake conversation. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=173.08s)]
*  Fox tries to cover for him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  And it's not funny. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=177.68s)]
*  You know, it could result in people dying, not getting accurate information. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=178.68s)]
*  And that to me is what's so insidious about this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=183.88s)]
*  No, I mean, well said. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=187.04s)]
*  Look, Trump just had a press conference a moment ago lying about California and lying [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  about water and lying about the fact that this big, beautiful bill is not going to hurt [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=193.2s)]
*  anybody. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=197.72s)]
*  I mean, this is what this guy does. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  And in some ways, you know, that's become so socialized. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=200.76s)]
*  We kind of roll our eyes and we roll with it sometimes. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  But you don't cover that up. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=206.76s)]
*  You don't double down on that lie. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=208.6s)]
*  You don't knowingly cover up and defame the character of someone else, particularly as [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=210.04s)]
*  you suggest, at this critical moment. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=214.6s)]
*  This was a you know, this was back and forth. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=216.72s)]
*  We've got I just want to remind people, let's let's just contextualize this exact moment. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  There are close to five thousand troops, federalized troops on the streets of Los Angeles [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=223.92s)]
*  right now for no apparent purpose or reason. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of them just sitting around for pure theater over the objections [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=233.6s)]
*  of the governor. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  They've been taken off the beat as local law enforcement. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=240.64s)]
*  They've been pulled off the border where I had directed them to address the issue of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=244.2s)]
*  counter narcotics and fentanyl interdiction. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=248.56s)]
*  They've been pulled out of the wildland urban interface, meaning the work that they were [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=250.96s)]
*  doing. Hundreds of these National Guardsmen were protecting us from this year's fire [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=255.44s)]
*  season. They've been pulled off for Trump's folly in the middle of all this back and forth. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=259.6s)]
*  It's right to have the Congress. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=264.56s)]
*  The question when did you talk to the governor? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=266.12s)]
*  What did you talk to him about? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=268.68s)]
*  It was the basis of litigation between the state of California and the Trump administration [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=270.48s)]
*  and federal court at the time. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=275.04s)]
*  Fox could have easily just dismissed yet another lie from the Trump administration. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=277.16s)]
*  Rather, they decided to knowingly cover it up and lie about this conversation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  And they did it in a way that not only directly impacts the notion of truth and trust, but [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=290.16s)]
*  I was starting to get calls from folks, supporters of mine, friends of mine saying, why are [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=295.52s)]
*  you, Gavin, lying about the call with Trump? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=299.44s)]
*  They apparently have the receipts. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=302.12s)]
*  There was no receipts. It was edited, redacted. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=304.08s)]
*  They knowingly and maliciously defamed and they should be held to a higher level of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=307.12s)]
*  ethical and journalistic standards. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=313.24s)]
*  Talk to us, Governor, about the damages request here. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=315.48s)]
*  I know there's some aspect of it that represents what Fox had settled for in a prior [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  case. And, you know, I had read that in the event of a recovery, where it would go. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=324.8s)]
*  Can you talk to that? Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=332.08s)]
*  Yeah. Not going to me. Look, you have to do it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  Defamation is a high bar. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  And I look, as I said, anyone who's ever watched Fox News knows I'm one of their main [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  targets. Never in the past years and years and years of being on the receiving end of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=342.8s)]
*  Fox and their propaganda. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=348.32s)]
*  Never have I been in this position. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=350.08s)]
*  We're so just so the red line was crossed. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  And so the defamation construct has to happen on an individual basis. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=355.4s)]
*  And it's a very high bar. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=360.28s)]
*  And so in this case, I've asked simply this. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=362.28s)]
*  Apologize. Give as much airtime to the multiple segments you did lying about this call [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=365.52s)]
*  in suggesting that I lied about this entire issue. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=373.08s)]
*  Give as much airtime as you did when you misrepresented those facts knowingly. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=378.36s)]
*  If you don't, then there should be you should be held to account, just as was the case [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=383.68s)]
*  with the defamation in the past. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=388.76s)]
*  They've been a subject to the Dominion case. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=390.24s)]
*  We all recall the seven hundred eighty seven million dollars you thought that would stop [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=393.52s)]
*  them from continuing these lies. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=397.24s)]
*  They obviously haven't learned their lesson. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=399.32s)]
*  And so in that case, those damages would go into a fund, not for me, but to advance truth [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=401.08s)]
*  and trust and ethics and to support causes that I think are universal in this country [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=407.24s)]
*  and protecting our democracy. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=415.96000000000004s)]
*  So that's that's the idea. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=417.36s)]
*  Simple apology. Do the right thing. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=419.32s)]
*  And by the way, of course, what do we get today? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=421.56s)]
*  We got almost a verbatim plus or minus an adjective, an adverb here and there. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=424.0s)]
*  The same statement they said when Dominion filed their lawsuit. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=429.76s)]
*  They've learned absolutely nothing. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=433.8s)]
*  Well, when Dominion filed the lawsuit, that was a big lie that Trump and his followers [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=435.8s)]
*  were talking about January 6th. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=442.24s)]
*  And now every day there are big lies and bigger lies that the Trump regime continues to push. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  And one of the things that you said is when you had that call with Donald Trump and you've [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=452.04s)]
*  seen him and I know you have a great deal of respect for the office of the presidency. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=458.0s)]
*  So you've been hesitant to, I think, let the public know how alarming his cognitive state [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=463.56s)]
*  is on these discussions. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=472.03999999999996s)]
*  And so I know it's difficult for you to lean into that because of what your view of the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=474.03999999999996s)]
*  presidency. But you said that if people knew what Trump said and how he behaved on these [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=480.23999999999995s)]
*  calls, it would send shivers up your spine. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=486.44s)]
*  Is there any additional information you can provide about that? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=489.79999999999995s)]
*  Because when we see him every day, it sends shivers up my spine when he makes up fake [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  conversations with world leaders that aren't happening. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=499.08s)]
*  And we're talking about life and death and matters of war and peace. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=502.23999999999995s)]
*  Life and death, matters of war and peace and just the foundational tenets of what holds [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=506.52s)]
*  democracies like ours together. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=514.04s)]
*  Again, truth and trust. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=516.4s)]
*  I continue to go back to those two foundational words. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=519.24s)]
*  Look, what was so alarming is not only his total stone cold misrepresentation, this in [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=522.84s)]
*  the case Trump's stone cold misrepresentation of what he discussed and the facts that he [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=530.0s)]
*  didn't discuss what he said he discussed. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=535.92s)]
*  It's what he wanted to discuss that is so alarming at a time. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=537.52s)]
*  And it's such a moral moment when he's federalizing or about to federalize. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=542.6s)]
*  In this case, that phone call happened a number of hours before he federalized the National [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=547.64s)]
*  Guard over the objections of the governor. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=551.72s)]
*  He didn't want to talk about that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=553.9200000000001s)]
*  He didn't want to engage in the conversation around L.A. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=555.44s)]
*  And what was so chilling is over a 16 minute period, what he did want to discuss, the [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=559.12s)]
*  president of the United States, what he actually wanted to discuss. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=564.48s)]
*  And in that context, it may become public. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=569.52s)]
*  And let me tell you why, because the House Oversight Committee is now requested, unsurprisingly, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=572.76s)]
*  all of our information, all of our correspondence. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=580.0s)]
*  That's fair game. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=582.9200000000001s)]
*  The correspondence directly with the chief of staff. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=584.2s)]
*  Fair game. And I made it clear to the chief of staff. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=587.12s)]
*  I made it clear to the White House that we will cooperate with federal oversight. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=590.9200000000001s)]
*  And that will include my contemporaneous notes that I took, unsurprisingly, with the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=597.24s)]
*  president of the United States that night. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=603.0s)]
*  And to the extent appropriate, that information will be shared in that form. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=605.36s)]
*  Before we go, what do you want the American people to know right now? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=610.5200000000001s)]
*  I think they were very comforted by your address to the state and address to the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=613.5600000000001s)]
*  nation. I think they like to see finally we have Democrats going on the offense and [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=619.5600000000001s)]
*  pushing back. There's this disastrous budget bill working its way through Congress that I [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=626.24s)]
*  don't want people to forget about it because people aren't forgetting about it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=633.32s)]
*  But I want to people are scared right now and they're looking for fighters. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=637.0s)]
*  So what do you want to say to the American people right now? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=640.6s)]
*  By the way, I'm about to have a press conference. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=642.8s)]
*  Three and a half million people going to lose their health care in California. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=644.2s)]
*  Three and a half million in the state of California. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=647.12s)]
*  President of the United States had a press conference in the Oval Office or at least in the [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=649.88s)]
*  White House briefing room where he said no one is going to be directly impacted and hurt by those [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=653.3199999999999s)]
*  cuts. What nonsense. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=658.12s)]
*  And so we're going to lay that out in detail. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=659.88s)]
*  So I appreciate you highlighting one of the most extraordinary and most impactful and [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=661.88s)]
*  devastating bills of a lifetime, the most significant rollback of health care in American [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=668.56s)]
*  history that's about to occur as early as this weekend in the United States Senate. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=674.12s)]
*  But what I want people to know is, you know, gloves are off. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=679.48s)]
*  Let's go. Enough. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=684.4399999999999s)]
*  We're going to stand up. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=687.0s)]
*  Truth. We're going to stand up for American people, going to stand up for people that are being [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=688.76s)]
*  bullied. We're going to have the backs of people that are scared. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=694.48s)]
*  We're going to use our formal authority. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=698.4s)]
*  I'm proud to be governor of the largest state in America. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=701.52s)]
*  Again, I've said this before to you. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=703.6s)]
*  Twenty one state populations combined. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=704.9599999999999s)]
*  But we're also going to use our moral authority and the extent we we need to. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=707.16s)]
*  We're also going to call out the bullshit and the propaganda and the weaponization of lies and [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=711.16s)]
*  mis and disinformation on networks like Fox. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=718.52s)]
*  And we'll do it in every capacity on behalf of the people I represent in the state and an individual [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=721.9599999999999s)]
*  capacity. Enough. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=726.68s)]
*  It's time to assert ourselves much more forcefully with character and conviction. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=729.04s)]
*  And have the backs of people that don't have the voice that some of us have and the ability to do [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=735.8s)]
*  what some of us can do. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=741.24s)]
*  And that's what this whole case is about. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=742.76s)]
*  And we'll continue to stand tall and and we'll continue to power through this remarkable moment in [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=745.24s)]
*  history. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=752.12s)]
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom, thanks for joining us. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6GXfixlZI&t=753.36s)]
