# LIVE: MeidasTouch RESPONDS to MAJOR Breaking News - 5/12/25
**MeidasTouch:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc)
*  Donald Trump accepting $400 million gifts in the form of a 747 jet from Qatar. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump brags about it and says that this is a great thing for America. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=10.16s)]
*  In my opinion, it is a unlawful thing that should be talked about in the proper context. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=15.44s)]
*  We will do that here on the Midas Touch Network. Also, Donald Trump fully caves and capitulates [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=21.92s)]
*  to China in front of the world. Donald Trump is trying to parade out what took place in Switzerland [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=28.16s)]
*  as a deal, but it really was a consensus for the total retreat or almost total retreat [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=36.4s)]
*  and withdrawal by the United States in their trade war against China. In the two quote-unquote deals [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=43.76s)]
*  that we've seen so far, one with the United Kingdom where Donald Trump is essentially giving [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  special carve-outs to Rolls Royce and Land Rover while taxing the United States and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  actually not doing a deal and this China capitulation. I think that Donald Trump may [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=64.72s)]
*  not be a good deal maker and not know what he's doing, but we'll talk about that here as well. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=69.84s)]
*  Donald Trump needed a new distraction after accepting a $400 million gift from Qatar and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  caving to China. So Donald Trump rolled out via executive order what he claims to be a new [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=82.32s)]
*  healthcare plan, but with all things Donald Trump, it is a scam. It's just him posting all caps and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=88.0s)]
*  not caps and then run on sentences that he's signing an executive order that he says is going [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  to lower prices 30%, 50%, 80%. Who knows even 90% on prescription drug prices and healthcare costs [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=100.63999999999999s)]
*  via an unlawful executive order while the MAGA Republicans are the ones who have been blocking [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=108.88s)]
*  the reductions to prescription drug prices and the ability of the government to negotiate [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=116.32s)]
*  in the private healthcare market the same way former President Biden fought to have the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=122.64s)]
*  government negotiate across Medicare. So we should talk about what Trump is really doing here, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=128.0s)]
*  which is actually likely going to lead to healthcare costs rising, but for Donald Trump, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=134.56s)]
*  it's just another scam. I'm going to bring your healthcare costs down 80%. I'm going to do such [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  a good work with tariffs that I'm going to, you're not even going to need to have taxes anymore. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  Everyone's just going to be so rich. It's why we call this the Ponzi scheme presidency, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=151.04s)]
*  the rug full presidency. Look no further than Donald Trump's own company because what may have [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=155.84s)]
*  been missed with all of these whack-a-mole stories that are taking place, Trump media reported to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=162.56s)]
*  the securities and exchange commissions that it has material weaknesses in its own accounting [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=169.84s)]
*  procedures such that the reliability of its own accounting submitted publicly may not be relied [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=176.72s)]
*  upon potentially because of its conduct. Also, I think for the first quarter, Trump media, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=185.92s)]
*  which runs Truth Social, lost what, like 29, $32 million something in that range and then only made [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=192.64s)]
*  800,000 in actual revenue, brought in 800,000 in revenue for the first quarter. I just want you to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=201.6s)]
*  think about that. Your local deli probably does about the same revenue as Trump's company and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  it certainly ain't losing $29 million. Then we should talk about all these MAGA Republicans [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=215.36s)]
*  from this weekend trying to, I don't know, justify the fact that Donald Trump wants to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  get rid of habeas corpus and destroy the Constitution. They're saying, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  oh, this is so brilliant. The MAGA Republicans parroting Donald Trump's lines that tariffs are [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=230.0s)]
*  going to be so great, but now they have to reverse that and say tariffs are actually really bad and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  you should have one doll and you should only have one pencil, little girls. While Donald Trump gets [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=240.8s)]
*  $400 million gifts from Qatar, we're going to break it all down. I think the American people [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=245.12s)]
*  understand what's up. I'm reporting from New York with my brother, Brett, and with [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=250.88s)]
*  Jordy. There he is. We're here for the Webbys this evening. I want to give everybody a heads up [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  in case some major news breaks while we're at the event that we have to pre-record this because [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=264.64s)]
*  we're going to be at the Webby event during the time of our normal recording. We're trying to [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=270.08s)]
*  capture everything that's occurred today up until this point. I think it'll be a very, very, very [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=275.35999999999996s)]
*  comprehensive show, but I wanted to flag that. Brett, Jordy, how you doing? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  We're doing great. It's great to be here with everybody. It's great to be with you brothers [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=285.2s)]
*  here in person in New York City for the Webby Awards. I want to apologize up front in case [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=288.64s)]
*  the quality isn't quite 100% this episode. We are at the whims of the hotel Wi-Fi. Jordy is [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=294.32s)]
*  sharing a space with me right here. Ben is a couple floors up, so we are doing our best, folks. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=300.32s)]
*  We got a lot of information to bring to you. We are so excited to speak with you about all the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=305.92s)]
*  latest updates. We're so excited for the Webby Awards tonight. It should be super cool. I just [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=310.88s)]
*  want to once again thank everybody for this because this obviously could not happen without [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=314.88s)]
*  any of you. For those who don't know, we have been awarded Webby Podcast of the Year, of all [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=319.68s)]
*  podcasts. I still think it's a prank until we go on stage and accept this thing. I still think it's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=325.92s)]
*  a big joke that people are pulling on me, but this has been very cool. You guys should be able to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=331.04s)]
*  watch, actually. If you're watching this live, I think you could probably watch that live right [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=335.6s)]
*  after. I believe it's watch.webbyawards.com. You could check out the Webby's tonight if you're [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=339.12s)]
*  watching this live with us, or you could watch the clips if you're listening to this on audio. If [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=344.72s)]
*  you're not listening on audio, by the way, make sure you check it out on the Midas Touch Podcast [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=348.72s)]
*  on Apple Podcasts and Spotify. We've had a busy few days here this morning. We also did Katie [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=352.32000000000005s)]
*  Kirk's podcast this morning. That's going to be released this Thursday, so make sure you look up [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  her show and look forward to our interview on her show. We had a really nice time in studio, the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  first in-studio interview that we've ever done as brothers, as crazy as that is in the five years of [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  Midas Touch. Check that out. Big moment Thursday. Katie Kirk's podcast. Make sure you check it out. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=374.96s)]
*  Jordy, what's the latest with your own? Super excited. Hey, everybody. It's going to be a [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=380.56s)]
*  great episode tonight. Katie, with the exclusive, the three brothers in studio the very first time. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=384.64s)]
*  This is very cool. You say in the five years, we've never all actually done an interview together. I [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=389.28s)]
*  don't know what would have led us to doing an interview with someone prior to what we've- [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=394.24s)]
*  I was thinking of the context of a reason why we have to. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=397.12s)]
*  No, it makes sense. I can't wait for tonight's show. Where do you want to start off, Benji? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=400.8s)]
*  Let's talk about Qatar because it's probably the least thing that Donald Trump wants to talk about. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=406.64s)]
*  So let me put that first because when we talk about what went down in China, it's not a deal. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=412.08s)]
*  And there's a reason that China isn't calling it a deal. It's a statement. It's a consensus [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  where the US is retreating and is withdrawing 145% tariffs. And when you add up all the ridiculous [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=426.48s)]
*  things that are still there, the US is going to be imposing a tariff of 30%, which is basically a tax [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=434.64000000000004s)]
*  on our own people. And China's like, okay, we'll only tax our own people 10%. So we'll reduce ours [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=442.64000000000004s)]
*  to 10%. Okay there. Okay there, Donald. That's the great, great art of the deal right there. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=449.44s)]
*  And then other than that as the consensus, there's then discussions to discuss further. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=455.2s)]
*  There's not a trade deal. It's not some sort of comprehensive document. It's literally Trump [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=461.68s)]
*  after saying that he's going to make everybody so rich that you're not going to need to pay income [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=467.68s)]
*  taxes, just basically taking them off the table and then show or removing the tariffs. And then [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=471.52s)]
*  basically showing yet once again, he will always back down to pressure and you can't take anything [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=477.52s)]
*  he says seriously at all and that he has no plan. And it's just him and market manipulation [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=484.4s)]
*  and just being arbitrary. Frankly, when I watch this, I don't know if you feel the same way. Part [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=492.4s)]
*  of me feels like I'm going insane the way some of the media reports on this. Just the way they're [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  like, we have a deal, folks. I'm like, what deal do we have? He lit the fire and now we put out [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=501.44s)]
*  some of the fire and you're calling that a deal? I truthfully don't understand this concept where [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=507.28s)]
*  you reward the arsonist with praise when he just kind of puts out some of the fire and doesn't [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=512.08s)]
*  actually get anything in return. I mean, remember the various promises, Ben, that you were just [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=518.32s)]
*  breaking down that he made to the American people with these tariffs, all the lies, all the scams. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=522.64s)]
*  We're going to get rich. There's going to be no more income tax anymore. Manufacturing is going [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=527.6s)]
*  to be rushing our way. Everything's going to be great. Meanwhile, what happened? We had shortages [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  at the ports. We had no ships coming in. We had a bond market in crisis. We had stocks in crisis. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=536.96s)]
*  Donald Trump panicking, reacting to all that news, begging every single day, China, to come to the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  table with him. And finally, he gives President Xi everything that Xi wants. And then we're supposed [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=548.0s)]
*  to act like this is some sort of genius deal making, like masterclass. I mean, give me a [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=553.6s)]
*  goddamn break here. It's unbelievable. The art of the deal. I mean, that's why you [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=558.32s)]
*  accurately describe it as the Ponzi scheme presidency. Yeah, and all of this stuff, because [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=563.28s)]
*  it's Ponzi scheme here, Ponzi scheme there. And who gets rich in the Ponzi scheme? The Ponzi [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=568.64s)]
*  schemer until they ultimately get busted, right? And so we'll get back to the China cave in a [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=574.56s)]
*  moment. But let's talk about Qatar here. Before talking about the jet 747 aircraft that's going [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=582.88s)]
*  to be gifted to Donald Trump and then Trump, his own personal library, which basically, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=593.12s)]
*  I'm not sure how you gift a plane to a an active plane to a library, which means [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=599.92s)]
*  libraries don't fly planes. We could all agree libraries don't fly planes, right? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=606.08s)]
*  Exactly. So it's basically a gift to Donald Trump. I mean, this has got gold plated walls, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=612.72s)]
*  golden toilet bowls, golden beds, and it's one of those things that Trump probably said to the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=618.24s)]
*  emir, I like this, I want that. You got to give me one of those. And obviously, there's a quid pro [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=625.12s)]
*  quo aspect to this. So Trump is, one of the evidences of that is Trump's traveling to the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=631.92s)]
*  Middle East and he's going to be meeting with Qatar. He's going to be meeting with Saudi Arabia. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=638.64s)]
*  He's going to be meeting with United Arab Emirates. And Trump has multiple deals with [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=644.24s)]
*  the sovereign wealth funds from these countries. Trump resorts in Qatar in addition to the airplane. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=650.0s)]
*  Trump resorts in Oman that's being built by the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund. The Abu Dhabi [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=656.72s)]
*  sovereign wealth fund is using the Trump crypto as one of its kind of major forms of currency [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=663.28s)]
*  for its transactions, which kicks back fees to Donald Trump as that kind of crypto is being used [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=669.44s)]
*  as kind of one of the forms of currency. And it props up one of these Trump ventures, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=677.0400000000001s)]
*  not to mention all the other griffs they're doing, like Don Jr. creating a club [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=683.6s)]
*  called the executive branch with the crypto czar while Abu Dhabi is using the Trump crypto. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=688.24s)]
*  It costs $500,000 to be a member of this club. And as we've seen with all of these clubs and [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=695.6s)]
*  exclusive whatever, Trump gives these people preferential access to him. I mean, look, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=701.68s)]
*  Donald Trump is selling- Can I pause for a second? He's calling it the executive branch? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=707.04s)]
*  Like all this talk over the past few years, all the sort of, was Hunter Biden selling access? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=714.08s)]
*  Like all that crap that was going on. And Donald Trump Jr. is running a grift that he literally [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=721.2s)]
*  calls the executive branch. I just need that to sit in people's brains just for one second. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=727.2s)]
*  Sorry, I had to point it out. Well, and not a peep do you really hear, right? I keep bringing it up [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=733.2800000000001s)]
*  because I don't want to lose these threads, which are actually massive scams and scandals, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=740.8000000000001s)]
*  which in our current environment are no longer reported. I'll give Dan Goldman, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=748.0s)]
*  Congress member Goldman credit because he kind of checked me on something that I was saying, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=756.96s)]
*  and he was right about this. And it's an important point to admit when I was wrong. I wasn't trying [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=761.76s)]
*  to be wrong. But one of the things I said to Congress member Goldman is I said, look, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=766.72s)]
*  when the Democrats win in 2026, you're going to be doing a lot of investigation. It was Ben, Ben, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  let me just be very clear here though. Yes, of course. But why is it all of a sudden that [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=777.68s)]
*  the Democrats have to be the ones to look into this? The account, you're so right. The accountability [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=782.9599999999999s)]
*  structure right now needs to be focused on why the hell aren't Republicans looking into this? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=788.56s)]
*  You know, there's still a Congress. And so why is it that when you have an authoritarian, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  and when you have a political party that gives away all of its co-equal branch authority, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=801.68s)]
*  is it therefore just accepted that they get to play by a different set of rules? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=809.12s)]
*  And then someone like former president Biden or someone like Obama gets held to a standard where [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=814.96s)]
*  if you're wearing a colored suit that doesn't satisfy the media, that becomes a mess of week [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=821.12s)]
*  long scandal and you're held to a completely different standard. Congress member Goldman was [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=827.76s)]
*  so right about that. And by the way, he was on the episode this morning, we were doing one of the [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=832.7199999999999s)]
*  episodes where we were talking about the Epstein files and the fact that, and we cover this [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=837.52s)]
*  relentlessly here on the Midas Touch Network, that there seems to be a concerted coverup by [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=842.7199999999999s)]
*  Pam Bondi and the White House to not release these files after claiming they were going to release [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=847.76s)]
*  it. It was an exclusive we got here at the Midas Touch Network. And as you all know, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=852.88s)]
*  I'm proud of all of the exclusives that we've been breaking here on the Midas Touch Network, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=858.24s)]
*  exclusives like that. And a major exclusive, whether it was the Virginia governor's race, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=862.4s)]
*  the governor's race in New Mexico, where some of our reporting has really been major, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=867.92s)]
*  major, played a major impact in those elections. Anyway, I digress. Let me get back though to [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=872.8s)]
*  talking about the influence and the cutter jet. So we talked about all these other Mideast [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=879.36s)]
*  Sovereign Wealth Fund contributions to Donald Trump. Well, now we're talking about a $400 million [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=887.6s)]
*  jet. My guess, though, first off, is that that $400 million is less than it is. I would say that [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=892.24s)]
*  it's probably somewhere in the range of $1.5 billion. Why do I say that? Because they lie [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=900.4s)]
*  about everything, number one. And number two, it's gold plated this gold plated that gold [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=906.0s)]
*  plated everything. You know, and if you know, like what a gold, you know, and I believe [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=911.52s)]
*  with cutter, it's probably real gold, not Trump fake gold, you know, like the fake gold he has [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=917.6s)]
*  all over the Oval Office. I think with cutter, they probably have real gold on, you know, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=922.16s)]
*  thinking what that royal family does. So I think it's probably more like 1.2 billion, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=927.92s)]
*  the baseline of that jet is whatever. And it's it's given to Trump to then go to his library. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=932.64s)]
*  So it's basically for Trump's personal use. Come on. And I don't just want to talk about it, like, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=939.12s)]
*  how bad that is. But I want to talk about it at the same I think we always have to contextualize [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=946.08s)]
*  it, right? Prices are not going down right now. Inflation is going up. Housing is not more [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=951.36s)]
*  affordable right now. Americans are struggling while Trump lies as we've solved everything. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=958.88s)]
*  Everything is great. So while American people are suffering, can't afford homes, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=964.88s)]
*  Trump defrauded everybody, the Ponzi Schemer, what's he doing? He's taking about 400 million to 1.2 [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=969.84s)]
*  billion dollar private jets for himself. And then he's saying that this is a great thing for America. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=978.08s)]
*  But I want to remind everybody here, there's a reason why the Boeing jet that was being designed [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=985.52s)]
*  to be the next Air Force One was not yet completed. It's because they had to redesign the whole plane [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=990.96s)]
*  to ensure that it had proper security features in Air Force One. It's one of the reasons why it's [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=998.0799999999999s)]
*  been delayed a little bit throughout this process. And so Trump's solve to this process is apparently [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1003.12s)]
*  now to get a jet from Qatar that doesn't have any of that security, that doesn't solve that issue, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1010.32s)]
*  that's now going to be a national security issue in addition to a blatant corruption bribery issue [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1016.48s)]
*  that we are seeing. Just none of it makes sense. And if you notice, you know, Trump also, what's [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1022.96s)]
*  his like big line, right? America first, his whole thing is we're going to take on the globalist, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1026.88s)]
*  the this and the that. Donald Trump always appears to be the biggest globalist in one situation. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1031.68s)]
*  That's when it benefits himself. If it benefits Donald Trump, he's doing deals with the Saudis. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1036.64s)]
*  He's doing deals with the Qataris. He's not doing deals for you. He's doing deals for himself. How [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1041.0400000000002s)]
*  could this help me? How could this help my rich buddies? How could I manipulate the market to help [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1045.3600000000001s)]
*  my friends? That's Donald Trump's brand of globalism that we're seeing. It's not for the American [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1049.2s)]
*  people. It's how could he put more money in his pocket? And to that point exactly, Brett, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1053.92s)]
*  what's Trump's defense when pressed on this? I would be a stupid person if I said no. That's [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1058.8000000000002s)]
*  literally what he said. I'd be like a stupid person if I said no. It's not about you, Donnie. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1064.32s)]
*  It's not about you. So think about it too. Like even Brett, you mentioned some Middle East nations. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1070.1599999999999s)]
*  But think about the deal with the UK, United Kingdom, right? Who did Trump's deal benefit? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1078.1599999999999s)]
*  Jaguar, Rolls-Royce, and Land Rover over American manufacturers. Right now, Jaguar, Land Rover, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1084.4s)]
*  and Rolls-Royce have a better deal than General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1097.8400000000001s)]
*  I just want you to think about that. That was Trump's first move, was helping luxury cars from [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1106.0800000000002s)]
*  the UK over American manufacturers. Just look at it like that. Jordy, to your point right there, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1112.88s)]
*  Donald Trump held a press conference and he was asked by a reporter, what do you have to say to [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1120.0s)]
*  people who view that luxury jet as a personal gift to you? I'm surprised it doesn't have to be [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1124.48s)]
*  phrased like that. The people who are saying that are accurately right. It is a gift to him. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1129.8400000000001s)]
*  That is what it is. It is a gift to Donald Trump. If it's anything to our Defense Department, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1135.92s)]
*  it is a Trojan horse. It is the perfect way for a foreign company to harm our Defense Department [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1143.68s)]
*  if we're going to be accepting a foreign-made Air Force one. A foreign-made Air Force one? What [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1150.48s)]
*  are we talking about? Here, play this clip. It's going to be very interesting. Mr. President, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1156.0s)]
*  what do you say to people who view that luxury jet as a personal gift to you? Why not leave it behind? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1160.96s)]
*  You're ABC fake news, right? Why not? It's only ABC. Well, a few of you would. Let me tell you, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1165.92s)]
*  you should be embarrassed asking that question. They're giving us a free jet. I could say, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1173.0400000000002s)]
*  no, no, no, don't give us. I want to pay you a billion or 400 million or whatever it is. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1178.16s)]
*  Or I could say, thank you very much. You know, there was an old golfer named Sam Snead. Did you [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1184.0800000000002s)]
*  ever hear of him? He won 82 tournaments. He was a great golfer. And he had a motto, when they give [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1189.84s)]
*  you a putt, you say, thank you very much. You pick up your ball and you walk to the next hole. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1194.6399999999999s)]
*  A lot of people are stupid. They say, no, no, I insist on putting it. Then they putt it and they [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1199.84s)]
*  miss it. And their partner gets angry at them. You know what? Remember that. Sam Snead, when they [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1204.48s)]
*  give you a putt, you pick it up and you walk to the next hole and you say, thank you very much. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1211.1999999999998s)]
*  When Cutter is behind funding for Hamas gives you a putter, you say, thank you. You're the United [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1215.36s)]
*  States of America. Your Air Force One is now going to be a hand me down gaudy golden jet [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1229.1999999999998s)]
*  from the Qatari Amir. Thank you. That's what America is supposed to be proud of today. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1243.44s)]
*  That's the new talking point now that all these magma brain losers in Congress and the Senate are [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1252.72s)]
*  going to have to do. We're so great. We got the hand me downs from Qatari Amir to Donald Trump [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1261.1200000000001s)]
*  instead of our own Air Force One when we're the United States of America. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1267.84s)]
*  Here, by the way, Donald Trump continues on that path and says, I could be a stupid person [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1272.16s)]
*  and say, we don't want a free plane here. Watch this. And it's going to be a while before we get [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1278.08s)]
*  them. And I think Qatar, who has really we've helped them a lot over the years in terms of [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1283.28s)]
*  security and safety, I felt that I think that and very, very nicely. And I have a lot of respect for [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1291.2s)]
*  the leadership and for the leader, Qatar. And I think they very they knew about it because they [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1296.8s)]
*  buy Boeing's, they buy a lot of Boeing's and they knew about it. And they said we would like to do [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1301.84s)]
*  something. And if we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1308.3999999999999s)]
*  of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture. Now, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1318.24s)]
*  I could be a stupid person to say, oh, no, we don't want a free plane. We give free things that will [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1324.1599999999999s)]
*  take one, too. And it helps us out. Because again, we're talking about we have 40 year old aircraft, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1328.8s)]
*  the money we spend, the maintenance we spend on those planes to keep them tippy top [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1335.36s)]
*  is astronomical. You wouldn't even believe it. So I think it's a great gesture from [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1340.0s)]
*  Qatar. I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I mean, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1344.8s)]
*  I could be a stupid person say, no, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane. But it was I [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1352.32s)]
*  thought it was a great gesture. I just want you to reflect on what he said. Right. Boeing, an [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1359.6s)]
*  American manufacturer had sold this jet to Qatar from before. And Donald Trump saying, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1366.48s)]
*  that then Qatar then wants to give it now that cutters used it and the Amir's used it, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1377.6799999999998s)]
*  they want to give it back to Donald Trump. He said something about tippy toppy, tippy toppy. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1381.92s)]
*  I don't even know what he's even talking about there. The maintenance costs are still going to [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1387.44s)]
*  be the maintenance costs. And if this is going to satisfy even our Defense Department criteria, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1391.76s)]
*  you're going to have to disassemble the entire plane and reassemble it to make sure that it's [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1401.28s)]
*  not bugged. And you are a stupid person to use your language if you think it's not bugged. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1406.96s)]
*  If you think that you've got such a great friendship with the Amir that they're going to [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1414.24s)]
*  not bug it, you've got it. You are truly a stupid person. So now our most private and classified [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1422.24s)]
*  information is going to go into the hands of Qatar. And we could talk about the bribe and the [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1432.0s)]
*  gift, but let's also talk about that he just compromised all of our national security the same [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1440.72s)]
*  way or way worse actually than the fact that they're having conversations on signal about [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1446.16s)]
*  war targets. And then they're telling us it's not classified. I want to take our first quick [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1454.08s)]
*  break of the show. We've got a lot more to discuss, but we have to talk about it in the [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1458.88s)]
*  right context like that because that's what I think sets apart this network and other things. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1462.64s)]
*  Like what we said there is how you have to report on it. If you want to report on it, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1469.44s)]
*  report on it accurately. Everything I said there was objective facts. I'm not giving you my opinion. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1473.5200000000002s)]
*  Those are the facts. That's what it is. Now, after all of that, you may say, I think this is a great [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1481.2800000000002s)]
*  deal that he gets the plane. I think that would be ridiculous, but at least you have the facts. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1487.04s)]
*  Not all your ABC, your fake news, your fake news. I mean, it's ridiculous. All right. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1492.56s)]
*  Let's take a quick break. When we come back, I want to talk about Trump caving [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1498.32s)]
*  yet again on this China consensus that was reached where basically it's Trump withdrawn. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1502.6399999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about the exclusive that Dan Goldman gave us on the Midas Dutch Network. And let's [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1507.44s)]
*  talk about more. Let's take our first quick break. Millions of Americans grind or clench [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1513.2s)]
*  their teeth at night and most don't even know that they're doing it. I was one of them. If [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1522.0s)]
*  you have jaw pain or headaches after a night's sleep, there's a high chance you grind or clench [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1525.76s)]
*  your teeth. Teeth grinding, also known as bruxism or TMJ, is generally caused by stress and it can [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1530.24s)]
*  cause serious damage such as eroding away your enamel and broken teeth, which leads to expensive [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1537.28s)]
*  dental bills. The solution to protecting your teeth is a mouth guard, but mouth guards from [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1543.76s)]

*  audio version of the Mitus Touch podcast. It's super helpful. And it's the whole reason why we [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1729.28s)]
*  got here in the first place. Over break, Ben, I was thinking like, this situation is interesting [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1732.96s)]
*  because I feel like time and time again, when we do these trips, like I, Brett and I are usually [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1739.28s)]
*  the ones recording together and you get your own fancy room. So just going to put that out there. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1744.24s)]
*  And then the other thing is I was thinking Brett's Terry Moranning me a little bit right now, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1748.96s)]
*  right? A little forced perception. Brett, upfront me, like way in the back over here, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1753.68s)]
*  a little forced perception here by Bert. Ben, you have to explain to our viewers what you mean by [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1758.0s)]
*  that. In the Terry Moran interview with Donald Trump on ABC, Terry Moran looked like he was a [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1762.88s)]
*  giant and Trump looked like he was very, very small. And then I had a look up how tall Terry [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1768.88s)]
*  Moran is. I'm like, is this guy six, nine or six, 10? And he was like five, nine, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1773.68s)]
*  five, 10. And so they made the ABC just kind of made Moran look so much bigger based on the angles [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1778.5600000000002s)]
*  that they looked. And it was actually, I mean, I thought he actually did probably among all of [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1784.24s)]
*  the bad interviews I've seen reporters do of Trump. I think his was probably the best one. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1788.4s)]
*  I'm not going to say it was a great interview, but he did a pretty decent job. Right. Let's talk about [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1792.4s)]
*  what went down in Switzerland over the weekend at the United States request because ships were not [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1797.04s)]
*  coming into our ports anymore. The United States met with China in Switzerland to discuss the trade [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1806.3999999999999s)]
*  war that the United States initiated against the world, but specifically here against China, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1815.36s)]
*  where Trump all of a sudden like escalated it from, you know, initially 30% to 50% to 145%. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1821.2s)]
*  China responded with 125% tariffs, which effectively meant a trading embargo between [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1831.1200000000001s)]
*  the United States and China. There's almost like a $1 trillion annual trading relationship between [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1837.52s)]
*  the U S and China. So it was actually devastating to the United States economy. China, if you actually [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1843.44s)]
*  looked at the data, they were able to basically send their goods elsewhere and their economy [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1850.8s)]
*  seemed to actually be increasing despite the propaganda from Trump saying the contrary was [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1858.08s)]
*  happening. So the United States needed a way to deescalate the situation is how at least it, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1863.84s)]
*  you know, it appeared to me. And then, so they met in Switzerland for two days. And I think the language [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1870.96s)]
*  of the sides tells you a lot about what took place, right? The United States referring to it as a [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1879.28s)]
*  historical reset, a massive deal. And then our media reflected it that way. The way China talked [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1886.56s)]
*  about it was a consensus that was reached for deescalation, that there will be talks that lead [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1895.36s)]
*  to more talks in the future. But for now, the United States would drop its tariffs from 145% [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1903.6s)]
*  to 30%, which let's be clear, that's a tax on the American importer passed on to the American [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1912.08s)]
*  consumer. And on the other hand, China would drop its tariffs against the United States from 125% [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1918.6399999999999s)]
*  to a 10%, essentially a 10% tax on its people. Now, if you actually read the wording of the deal [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1927.6s)]
*  itself, which is what I tried to do, the wording of the deal certainly looks, it doesn't use the [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1935.76s)]
*  word deal. Let me be very clear there. It uses the word consensus. So let me be clear about my [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1942.08s)]
*  language as well. And it says that there's discussions to discuss more, but that the U.S. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1946.8s)]
*  is going to that level that I just discussed, 30% in China is going to a 10%. If you just take [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1953.52s)]
*  a look at how China is messaging this at home, they've got like cartoons of Uncle Sam being [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1961.52s)]
*  uppercut by another cartoon image of some being that represents tariffs. And then when you read [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1968.24s)]
*  how China describes the whole situation, let me just share with you what they're saying. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1977.52s)]
*  So you understand at least how they're messaging this. As a major power in the world, the U.S. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1983.52s)]
*  should act as such in a responsible way. However, the frequent backsliding and wanton changes in [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1989.28s)]
*  trade rules of the government have damaged the country's credibility of itself. The U.S. has [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=1995.04s)]
*  become an unreliable and fickle player in global economic governance with its strategic credibility [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2001.2s)]
*  and international status being continuously eroded by its short-sighted behavior. The U.S. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2006.96s)]
*  is trying to curb China's economic development through high tariffs, but the reality is quite [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2012.32s)]
*  the opposite. The global supply chain has formed an intricate network and China has cultivated [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2016.88s)]
*  irreplaceable advantages in basic manufacturing, support industries, and labor. The high tariff [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2023.2s)]
*  policy of the U.S. will not be able to hit China, which in turn will seriously damage its own economic [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2028.8s)]
*  interests. China will not succumb to any form of economic coercion and will resolutely defend its [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2034.08s)]

*  The Chinese government had taken a series of precise countermeasures. Then it goes on to talk [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2049.52s)]
*  about history has long proven the large-scale unilateral tariff hikes will only lead to more [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2054.72s)]
*  sanctions lists and tit-for-tat confrontations escalating tensions between the countries. Now, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2060.88s)]
*  that message is not only intended for the people who live in China, but it's also intended for the [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2066.7200000000003s)]
*  rest of the world because one of the big problems that has arisen out of this trade war is that the [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2074.32s)]
*  United States credibility as a stable player in international trade has been potentially irreparably [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2081.6s)]
*  damaged. As we posted on the Midas Touch account, social media accounts, we basically said U.S. and [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2092.88s)]
*  China agreed a 90-day pause on new tariffs after shipping to U.S. ports plummeted. U.S. tariffs on [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2099.68s)]
*  Chinese imports will be cut from 145% to 30%. Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports will be cut from [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2105.92s)]
*  125% to 10%. If tariffs are supposed to result in massive job growth and make the U.S. rich, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2111.6s)]
*  why is Trump lowering them? I mean, and then this graphic for our audio listeners is a graphic of [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2119.92s)]
*  Trump saying, I'm adding tariffs. And then his MAGA supporters go, this will create jobs. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2125.36s)]
*  And then Trump goes, I'm removing the tariffs. And the MAGA supporters go, art of the deal. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2131.2000000000003s)]
*  Then Trump says, I'm adding tariffs. And the MAGA supporters go, this will create jobs. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2135.28s)]
*  And then Trump says, I'm removing tariffs. They go, this will be the art of the deal. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2139.28s)]
*  Donald Trump's been saying that the fact that no ships are coming to our ports is a great sign [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2143.92s)]
*  that America is winning this thing. He doesn't want to see the ships coming to our port, he said. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2151.52s)]
*  He said that we're going to be taking in so much money on these tariffs from China that we are not [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2156.96s)]
*  even going to need to have an income tax anymore. By the way, even what you just said there [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2163.84s)]
*  is a contradiction in and of itself. If there are no ships coming in, then we are thereby not [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2169.36s)]
*  receiving any tariff revenue. And we are thereby not getting rich, as Donald Trump puts it. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2175.52s)]
*  Everything he says contradicts the next thing he says in this argument. And he keeps kind of just [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2182.48s)]
*  deciding which one he wants to do just based on a whim. He just kind of throws it all out there [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2188.1600000000003s)]
*  and hope it sticks, even when none of it makes any sense whatsoever. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2193.04s)]
*  I'll give you two data points. One from economics professor from Michigan University, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2197.04s)]
*  Justin Wolfers, who says, there are two ways to frame this news. One, U.S. trade policy and our [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2203.12s)]
*  macroeconomic prospects are much better today than they were yesterday. Or two, U.S. trade policy and [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2208.64s)]
*  our macroeconomic prospects are much worse today than on inauguration day. Both are true. I mean, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2214.96s)]
*  you have to understand, China got what it wanted out of this deal because China wants to keep its [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2224.56s)]
*  markets open to American products. That's why it's only going to have a 10% tariff. The U.S., [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2228.8s)]
*  while backing down for 145%, is still keeping a 30% tariff, which is going to be high. And that is [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2236.88s)]
*  going to be passed on to consumers. And businesses are going to use this as a pretext as well to [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2245.28s)]
*  raise prices to try to increase their profits as well. Let me tell you how Charles Gasparino, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2252.6400000000003s)]
*  a Fox host or a Fox business writer, New York Post writer as well, here's what he says, breaking. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2257.84s)]
*  Trump raised tariffs on the world, the markets, particularly the bond market, which we need to [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2264.72s)]
*  finance our debt, rebelled. Trump then was forced to back off. End of story. He goes on to say, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2270.72s)]
*  basically the same. And what was Trump talking about today? Trump says that we, what did we, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2277.12s)]
*  I mean, I mean this sincerely. What did we get from China? I asked the question on social media. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2283.12s)]
*  I said, what is it that we got from this deal? Let me know. I mean, for real, if I'm missing [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2289.52s)]
*  something, all the MAGA people, Brett, who literally are right out of central casting from [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2295.12s)]
*  the meme that you create are like, we redid the trade deal. No, no, we didn't. There was literally [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2299.2s)]
*  nothing that changed. The only thing that Donald Trump can point to is he says that he believes [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2304.8s)]
*  that there will be less fentanyl coming in from China. And he says, I take them at their word, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2311.6s)]
*  whatever, whatever that means. I take them at their word. Play this clip of Trump saying that [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2318.8s)]
*  from today. But so that's a very important subject to me because I've everybody in this room has lost [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2324.32s)]
*  friends or people that have family members that have died of fentanyl. So there's a big incentive [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2332.6400000000003s)]
*  for China to stop and I take them at their word. They're going to work on that. I think very hard. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2339.92s)]
*  By the way, last week, Donald Trump said that he took the Houthis [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2344.88s)]
*  at their word and praise their bravery and basically shouted them out [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2350.88s)]
*  nicer than you've ever heard him talk about Ukraine or Canada or Europe or any of our actual [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2359.28s)]
*  allies. I take the Houthis at their word. By the way, that was barely a story as well. I did a whole [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2364.88s)]
*  video here on the Midas Touch Network. But what Trump did there also is part of his predatory [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2372.48s)]
*  behavior. As we'll soon talk about the healthcare costs, Trump recognizes that fentanyl is a major [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2380.4s)]
*  issue. It's true that we probably all have someone in our family or someone who's a friend or [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2386.96s)]
*  someone that we know who's died of a fentanyl overdose or who's died of opioids and who's been [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2393.2s)]
*  or whose life has been severely harmed. So Trump, this is what he knows. He knows it's a bad deal. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2399.44s)]
*  So he uses fentanyl as a way to pull on the heartstrings and lie to people that he's extracted [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2406.8s)]
*  some benefit that's going to result in less fentanyl coming in. And there's nothing in the deal [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2415.36s)]
*  or lack of a deal. There's nothing in the consensus in the joint statement that says anything [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2422.64s)]
*  like that at all. And let me remind everybody, say none of this happened, right? Reset, like, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2429.28s)]
*  let's go back months from now or months ago. And Donald Trump comes out today and he announces [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2435.92s)]
*  the exact parameters of this deal. We are increasing tariffs by 30% on China. China has [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2442.6400000000003s)]
*  increased tariffs on us. It would be like pandemonium. It would be like the Liberation [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2449.52s)]
*  Day disaster, so-called. This is just going back to that. These are the tariffs that have been [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2455.12s)]
*  rolled back aren't even those tariffs. The tariffs that have been rolled back are the [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2462.16s)]
*  additional ones when Donald Trump threw a tantrum because China decided to actually stick up for [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2465.7599999999998s)]
*  themselves after Donald Trump attacked them with these various tariffs. So you've got to put it in [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2470.4s)]
*  perspective too because when you have media, when you have Trump and all the MAGA people try to [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2475.3599999999997s)]
*  claim this as some sort of major victory, we're not even back to zero. We're still above where [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2480.72s)]
*  they were today. That's why the Wolffers tweet that we showed before, Ben, his statements, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2486.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, were so on point because, you know, he shows that literally we are still in a much [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2490.9599999999996s)]
*  worse place than we were since the inauguration. This is still devastating for American families, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2497.8399999999997s)]
*  for American workers, for American consumers. This is still leading us on a path where we are [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2504.3999999999996s)]
*  very likely to enter a recession. Not to mention the fact you can't exactly just unwind all this [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2509.76s)]
*  stuff that Donald Trump did overnight. Remember, the port orders, the orders that we are seeing of [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2515.6000000000004s)]
*  these ships, the freight coming into the ports across the country, whether it be Los Angeles or [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2520.8s)]
*  Seattle or you name it, those are already set in stone right now. That's already happening right [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2525.5200000000004s)]
*  now as we speak. Dock workers are being fired right now as we speak. The shortages are happening [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2531.28s)]
*  right now as we speak. And just because Donald Trump rolled these tariffs back does not mean all [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2538.64s)]
*  of that is even fixed tomorrow. Not to mention the uncertainty that this also puts into the entire [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2544.16s)]
*  economy. Not to mention the fact that say you were even more, say you're the biggest Trump supporting [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2549.8399999999997s)]
*  business on the planet and you go, oh, he's putting in these tariffs. I'm going to change my whole [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2554.96s)]
*  business model right now in order to accommodate these tariffs. I'm going to try to bring [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2559.6s)]
*  manufacturing here. I'm going to try to change things around. Donald Trump just screwed you. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2564.24s)]
*  Also, you're in the middle of doing all that. Donald Trump just made all that worthless. So [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2568.16s)]
*  how could you make any long-term business decisions at all right now if you don't know what Donald [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2572.08s)]
*  Trump is going to do? If he's just going to decide on a whim, tariffs on, tariffs off, I'm the best. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2577.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, love it. Enjoy your one doll. Enjoy your Range Rover. The whole thing is just so insane. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2583.4399999999996s)]
*  And again, the deeper issue too is that the overall brand of America, and this is China's [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2589.68s)]
*  strategic thinking of this, that you may not like that you hear. I'm just letting you know what the [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2602.72s)]
*  reality is, what China's thinking about this. China's like, we stood up to them. They withdrew [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2607.12s)]
*  a crazy 145% tariff away. We gave up nothing for it. And we look, and this is what China [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2614.8s)]
*  always wanted. We look like the adult. And they look like what people thought China was. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2625.6800000000003s)]
*  We look like America and they look like China. That's what China wanted. And now they're saying [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2634.2400000000002s)]
*  that's what China looks like now. And America is looked at as this crazy actor. And then you may [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2641.36s)]
*  go, well, look, you know, so another administration comes back in afterwards and fixes it. The problem [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2648.96s)]
*  is, is that the trauma that this injects on the overall macroeconomics of policy is such that the [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2656.48s)]
*  world then says, well, how do we know that this country is not going to bring back in another Trump [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2667.6s)]
*  in eight years from now or four years from now, and we're going to be at this again? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2672.4s)]
*  So there's short term stuff, but the longer term stuff is how China thinks about things, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2676.4s)]
*  a civilization that's been around for 5,000 years. And they're playing the long game. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2683.8399999999997s)]
*  And Trump is playing a game to win the headlines every day. And this may be an example. Did Trump [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2689.8399999999997s)]
*  win the headlines from corporate media that framed this as a good deal and the markets went up? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2696.24s)]
*  But the, sure. But the ink, but the reality is, and why people are not watching corporate news [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2702.7999999999997s)]
*  and watching Midas is because people know that's bullshit. And people know what they're experiencing [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2708.3199999999997s)]
*  and they don't want to be told by billionaires and oligarchs that what they're experiencing is not [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2714.3199999999997s)]
*  real. And we have to live in Trump's make believe reality TV show world when we, the people are [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2721.12s)]
*  really suffering and they want people who speak to that and go, I know what's really going on. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2725.92s)]
*  This is bullshit. What just happened? Market manipulation, billionaires made money, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2730.48s)]
*  buying dips and going up and regular people had to drain their five 29s and 401ks and pensions [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2735.44s)]
*  because they were really screwed by this. If they even could have that people can't afford homes, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2742.8s)]
*  people losing their jobs, our economy contracted while China's economy is growing. And under former [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=2747.36s)]

*  including by the way the tax bill by the MAGA Republicans. I think it's going to be adding [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3035.44s)]
*  four trillion dollars to the debt limit, like the least fiscally responsible people out there. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3040.5600000000004s)]
*  We'll cover that, but first let's talk about what Democratic Congress member Dan Goldman did today. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3046.56s)]
*  I think this is an important issue. You all know here at the Midas Touch Network that we keep on [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3052.08s)]
*  this story. We've been talking about the Epstein list, which more properly should be talked about [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3056.72s)]
*  as the Epstein files, court documents, videos, under seal filings of the co-conspirators, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3063.2s)]
*  of people who were involved with Epstein. There have been prior document dumps years ago. Trump's [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3071.04s)]
*  name is in them. Trump's name is in deposition transcripts of women Epstein traffic going to [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3080.56s)]
*  Trump casinos. Trump's on Epstein's flight log at least seven times, but it's only a [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3085.2799999999997s)]
*  partial release of the flight log. There's Epstein's call list or a Rolodex basically [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3090.56s)]
*  and Trump's name, like Trump's bodyguards and various Trump phone numbers are all over Epstein's [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3098.16s)]
*  phone and contact list. We know Epstein was on Trump's jet. A 14-year-old girl at the [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3104.7999999999997s)]
*  Ghislaine Maxwell trial, she's now a woman, but she was a Jane Doe at Ghislaine's trial. Said when she [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3111.6s)]
*  was 14, she was introduced to Trump by Ghislaine and Epstein. Trump, I think, is listed as Doe. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3119.2s)]
*  So 171 or 173 or 178, something in the 170s. What was it, 171? 174. 174. I'm bound to get one [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3125.52s)]
*  right, but I guess all of them wrong. Doe 174 in one of the proceedings. So we would know [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3136.16s)]
*  if I was the lawyer on the case, I would say document request. Give me every information [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3145.92s)]
*  about Doe 174. Give me all the grand jury testimony from Jane Doe, who was 14 years old at the time. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3149.76s)]
*  It would be an easy request to basically find out this stuff. The Trump MAGA world and spreading [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3156.6400000000003s)]
*  all of their Epstein conspiracies have been trying to blame everybody else as being involved [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3162.96s)]
*  in this with Epstein, but Trump was like, it's always projected. This is one of the ultimate [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3169.0400000000004s)]
*  projection and confession because Trump was like Epstein's closest friend. They were like best friends [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3172.7200000000003s)]
*  in Palm Beach for at least a period of time. That's how Epstein at least classified it. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3178.64s)]
*  They would party together. They would hang out together. Epstein would find girls that he [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3183.6s)]
*  trafficked at Mar-a-Lago. Virginia Joufray, who died by suicide, she was homeless. Then she got a job [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3187.84s)]
*  at Mar-a-Lago. And then Ghislaine Maxwell found her at Mar-a-Lago, brought her to Epstein, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3193.12s)]
*  and Epstein trafficked her. So we've been documenting this. And Pam Bondi's been lying [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3200.08s)]
*  and saying that she was going to turn over the documents. And at first she invited all these [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3206.0s)]
*  right-wing influencers, gave them binders, and they like trying to defraud the American people. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3209.68s)]
*  They like held it up and pretended they had the Epstein files. It was like, those are the, that's [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3214.8s)]
*  the phone log that was been released years ago. And by the way, there's Trump's name on it. But [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3218.96s)]
*  that was, that's not the files. There's probably terabytes of information. They've like blown every [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3224.56s)]
*  one of their deadlines now where they said this is going to be turned over. They just want us to [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3231.36s)]
*  forget about it. But we keep talking about it, even if corporate news doesn't want to talk about [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3235.92s)]
*  it. And you know, it's good to see impact journalism too, where it's having an impact. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3243.12s)]
*  Democratic Congress member Dan Goldman. Hey, can I just pause on Pam Bondi for a second? Because [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3247.28s)]
*  I think Pam Bondi is an interesting character that's kind of emerging throughout the many [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3252.16s)]
*  facets of corruption of the Trump administration right now. Because you look at this Epstein [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3257.36s)]
*  situation right now, for example, who was the AG, who was the attorney general of Florida [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3262.08s)]
*  when Epstein essentially got a slap on the wrist during his crime spree? Pam Bondi. She was the [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3267.7599999999998s)]
*  attorney general. She could have done something. Pam Bondi did not. Pam Bondi basically let Epstein [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3274.48s)]
*  off the hook. That's my one point of view, right? Now that's my one point right there. Now let's go [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3280.16s)]
*  back to what we were speaking about earlier in the episode, right? Qatar and the Qatari jet that [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3285.36s)]
*  was given to Donald Trump. What is the linkage there with Pam Bondi and this? Why was Pam Bondi [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3290.56s)]
*  chosen as attorney general after Matt Gaetz? Well, in the situation of Qatar, Pam Bondi was [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3297.2s)]
*  literally a foreign agent of the Qatari government. Let me repeat that. Pam Bondi was literally a [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3303.2s)]
*  registered foreign agent of Qatar. She was paid handsomely for being a registered foreign agent [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3310.72s)]
*  of Qatar. Pam Bondi was paid what Ben? $115,000 per month. Let me repeat that as well. $115,000 [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3317.76s)]
*  per month to be a registered agent for Qatar, to be a consultant of the Qatari government. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3330.4s)]
*  Now, when you see her approve these purchases of the jet, for example, from the Qataris, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3338.96s)]
*  when you see her apparently brush aside all this Epstein stuff, and then you look into her recent [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3345.84s)]
*  past and you see, oh wait, she's got this interesting connection to Epstein here. Oh wait, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3353.52s)]
*  she's got this interesting connection to the Qataris here. Doesn't it all kind of go, oh, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3357.84s)]
*  at least this is an interesting link right here that you could make between the person who Donald [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3363.84s)]
*  Trump decided out of all people to choose as his attorney general. I mean, I just feel like this [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3368.56s)]
*  isn't focused on enough, and so I needed to bring it up. So Dan Goldman sent this letter [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3374.64s)]
*  to Pam Bondi saying, what's up? Turn it over. And he also said, I'm a former 10-year federal [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3380.0s)]
*  prosecutor. I know that this stuff could be released by now. What are you doing? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3385.7599999999998s)]
*  It's very easy if you wanted this release. And also let me know, and this is what I think was [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3390.4s)]
*  powerful about his letter, the connections to Trump. Is your whole purpose of this delay [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3395.6s)]
*  going through this to redact any references to Trump? Because what else is taking you [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3402.56s)]
*  this amount of time? Is that what you're doing? We want to know that. Now here's what Goldman [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3406.7999999999997s)]
*  said when I interviewed him in a minus touch exclusive. Let's play it. And so there was a [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3412.32s)]
*  mad dash and a big rush to release everything, and everyone was talking about it. And now there's [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3416.7999999999997s)]
*  radio silence. And the begs the question, why has the attorney general gone dark on this? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3422.56s)]
*  Why has Congresswoman Luna and others stopped calling for it? What is it that's in the Epstein [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3431.2799999999997s)]
*  files that they were so eager to have that now are just not being released, according to the [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3438.16s)]
*  attorney general's promises of transparency, but are still there? And there's no explanation. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3446.32s)]
*  And the concern I have, of course, is we know Donald Trump had a friendship with Jeffrey [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3455.52s)]
*  Epstein. We know Jeffrey Epstein had numerous numbers for Donald Trump. And the question then [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3462.0s)]
*  is, was this some sort of directive from Donald Trump or someone on his staff or an agent of his [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3468.0s)]
*  to the attorney general to kill this? And that would be yet another pretty egregious act of [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3475.04s)]
*  corruption using his position as president for his own personal benefit. It is incumbent upon [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3483.84s)]
*  the Republicans currently in the majority to do their damn job, do their job and conduct oversight [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3490.32s)]
*  over the president of the United States. Stop sucking up to him so much. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3496.96s)]
*  Powerful, powerful stuff right there. And glad that we could break that here on the minus touch [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3502.8s)]
*  network. Let's talk about anyone who wants to hear the full interview with Dan Goldman, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3509.28s)]
*  make sure to add the Midas Touch podcast on Apple podcasts or Spotify. You can listen to the [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3513.52s)]
*  exclusive interview right there. You could also watch on YouTube, but I'm telling you, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3518.0800000000004s)]
*  check it out on the Apple podcast or Spotify. I know you guys will love it. If you've already [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3522.32s)]
*  added the Midas Touch podcast, also be sure to leave a five star review. It really helps. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3526.48s)]
*  Oh, absolutely, Brett. Now, just talk briefly about this health care scam that Trump's been [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3531.28s)]
*  engaged in. And again, I think we all would like to see lower prescription drug prices, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3537.68s)]
*  lower health care costs. There's a way to do that. And a way to do that is you go and you [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3543.52s)]
*  pass legislation. And one of the things that I think is a way you reduce prices and why prices [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3549.12s)]
*  are cheaper in other countries is that the government speaks with one voice [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3554.7999999999997s)]
*  and it reduces the prices, prices as a, as it negotiates a reduction. The way right now, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3559.36s)]
*  former president Biden was able to get it done with Medicare, but he was not able to do it in [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3569.6s)]
*  the private sector because people like Trump and Magna block that from taking place. If you could [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3574.32s)]
*  have the government negotiate across all pharmaceutical companies and drug manufacturers, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3579.28s)]
*  you could lower the prices while still having market forces at play, but you would significantly [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3584.32s)]
*  drive the prices down. Magna blocked that. So what Trump's gimmick is, and what he's saying he's [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3590.88s)]
*  going to do in this long meandering social media post is in theory, I guess, if you get it done, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3597.52s)]
*  it's not a bad thing. He says it's unfair that in foreign countries people are paying less [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3603.84s)]
*  for pharmaceuticals. True. And America should pay the same amount of money as the, as people are [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3612.08s)]
*  paying in other countries for pharmaceuticals. True. So Trump says he's issuing an executive order [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3620.64s)]
*  that will right away lower prescription drug prices by 80 to 90%. That's false. That's false. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3628.0s)]
*  So now you're playing with people's lives. You're pulling at their heartstrings, their health, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3635.68s)]
*  and you're leading people to believe you're doing something that you're not going to actually be [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3644.0s)]
*  able to do. One, the executive order is not a law. So you can't by executive order decree this. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3648.7999999999997s)]
*  You can't. It will be deemed invalid by courts. It's dead on arrival because an executive order [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3657.6s)]
*  doesn't have the force to do this. And by the way, Trump tried to do a very similar executive [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3665.2s)]
*  order in his first term as well, and it was shot down by the courts. And so he's basically, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3670.24s)]
*  it's essentially a rehash of that, which was already deemed out of his, you know, purview here. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3674.72s)]
*  If you want to lower the prices, you don't do it by a phony executive order. What you do is you [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3681.2s)]
*  say to Congress, pass universal health care and make it accessible and free and affordable to all [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3687.4399999999996s)]
*  Americans. Make it a right. That's what exists in other countries. That's why it's lower. But you [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3692.8s)]
*  see Trump is using this as a way to try to attack other countries and particularly attack the [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3699.1200000000003s)]
*  countries in Europe that he says he wants to investigate the countries, not the companies. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3706.48s)]
*  And so what could end up happening is that these companies have to now increase their prices [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3713.44s)]
*  abroad as well, or take their products out of the United States to begin with, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3719.04s)]
*  create scarcity issues versus actually if you want to deal with this, if this isn't a gimmick, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3728.08s)]
*  if this isn't a scam, then we should just do it the right way. Instead, what the mega Republicans [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3735.04s)]
*  are doing is their new kind of tax bill, top line, bottom line numbers are out. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3741.44s)]
*  They have to increase the debt ceiling under their policy by what was it at least? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3748.08s)]
*  They want to do it what? Four trillion in tax cuts and they want to add, they want to increase [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3756.16s)]
*  the debt limit by $4 trillion to make way for like $4 trillion in tax cuts for billionaires, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3762.0s)]
*  not for regular folks, for the richest Americans. And they're going to find this money, again, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3769.36s)]
*  one by making it up, by claiming that they, by lying that these tariffs have raised all this money, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3779.1200000000003s)]
*  which they have not. That's one of their scams. And the other scam that they're going to do [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3786.4s)]
*  is they're going to take this away from Medicaid and education and all of the other services. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3794.56s)]
*  They're going to rob Peter to pay Paul, in this case, Paul is the billionaire oligarch, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3800.32s)]
*  and they're going to get paid in the form of massive tax cuts for the wealthy. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3806.56s)]
*  By the way, this also shows how just malleable all the kind of MAGA supporters are on literally [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3810.56s)]
*  any issue that, say for maybe Laura Loomer, who actually pushes back on Trump oddly enough, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3816.88s)]
*  but you see all of these people, it's very weird time, folks, but you see all these people right [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3823.12s)]
*  after Donald Trump made this kind of scam announcement about here's how we're going to [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3828.56s)]
*  do this lower drug prices thing. All the MAGA people who spent the last few years, anytime any [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3833.12s)]
*  sort of Democrat called for caps on price gouging or anything of the like, whether it be with [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3839.12s)]
*  prescription drugs or grocery prices, you name it. What do they say? This is communism, you're a [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3844.7999999999997s)]
*  communist. Donald Trump said this during the campaign. He called stuff like this communist, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3850.8s)]
*  all that. This is communist. It never works. It's been tried. It's communism. It's communism. It's [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3855.28s)]
*  communism. You know who would never go for any of this stuff other than the decreasing the tax [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3859.2000000000003s)]
*  burden on the wealthiest Americans are the Republicans in Congress as well. So part of the [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3865.76s)]
*  scam that Trump is playing here, he knows that they're not going to go for this. He knows that [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3870.2400000000002s)]
*  this is going to be shot down in the courts. And I'm all for lowering drug prices, honestly, by any [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3874.7200000000003s)]
*  means. I'm fine. I'm frankly fine with Donald Trump trying this. Like I'm going to say that. Sure, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3879.68s)]
*  go for it. But what I don't like is how he's manipulating people into thinking that this is [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3885.8399999999997s)]
*  actually going to be something that happens. Because like Ben said, this is playing with [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3889.68s)]
*  people's lives here. And we know that is going to get shot down in the courts. We know that the way [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3893.44s)]
*  to do this is via the Congress. And I think one of the interesting approaches I want one interesting [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3898.72s)]
*  approach I've seen, and at least I think it's a unique approach. I don't know your thoughts, Ben [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3902.64s)]
*  or Jordy, but I saw Ro Khanna yesterday, Congressman Ro Khanna say, all right, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3907.68s)]
*  Donald, you want to do this thing? All right, let's put a bill on the floor. Okay, let's do a law. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3912.08s)]
*  Okay, let's get the Republicans. Let's all do this. We'll pass this. We'll pass the bill. Okay, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3916.3199999999997s)]
*  we'll cap the prescription drug prices. You ready? Bet? Let's do it. Let's make it happen. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3919.92s)]
*  Ro Khanna knows that's not going to happen. He knows that this is all just a scam by Donald Trump, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3924.7999999999997s)]
*  but it's just his latest scam. It's this or the everything. And if you notice, just across the [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3930.08s)]
*  board, Trump dangles these things that he knows that will never happen. Even for example, one of [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3935.44s)]
*  the things that Trump has kind of pushed out there through all these sort of side sources and things [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3940.64s)]
*  just so he could be asked about it is, you know, Donald Trump might actually be open to raising [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3947.2000000000003s)]
*  taxes on the wealthiest Americans. He might actually be open to this idea. Something he knows [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3952.56s)]
*  is never going to happen. And then Donald Trump has asked about it. He goes, oh yeah, I'm all for it. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3956.96s)]
*  Oh wait, what? The Congress won't let me do it. I was going to do it, but you know what? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3960.88s)]
*  Hands are tied. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3967.2000000000003s)]
*  My hands are tied. I just can't do it. So I actually got to give them a massive tax cut. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3968.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. I just couldn't do anything. You wanted those Doze checks? You wanted 5,000? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3972.8s)]
*  You thought it was Doze checks? I just can't. They won't let me. You got to ask Congress. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3978.08s)]
*  You got to ask Mike John. It's the same scam over and over. He dangles these things at people [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3984.2400000000002s)]
*  and says, oh look, I might actually be okay with this sort of thing. And then he pulls it back, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3988.56s)]
*  which is to me even worse than him not doing anything at all. The way he gets people's hopes [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3992.7999999999997s)]
*  up with these things, the way he manipulates people, it's just really atrocious. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=3998.64s)]
*  So I'll say this as we conclude. Let me share with you from Trump's own media company, his own [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=4003.68s)]
*  personal private company. How is he handling things with his own company? I'll just read from [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=4012.16s)]
*  you his latest filing. Here's what it says based on their financials, by the way, where they show [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=4018.8799999999997s)]
*  another really kind of atrocious quarter where they lost $31.7 million on $821,000 in net sales. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=4026.3999999999996s)]
*  Here's what it says. Based on this evaluation, as of March 31st, 2025, the certifying officers [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=4035.6s)]
*  of Trump media concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=4042.96s)]
*  of that date due to material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=4049.2s)]
*  including our failure to design and maintain formal accounting policies, processes, and controls [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=4055.12s)]
*  to analyze and account for complex transactions as well as a need for additional accounting [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=4064.4s)]
*  personnel who have the requisite experience in SEC reporting regulation. That's Trump's own filing [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=4070.7200000000003s)]
*  on his own company where he can even balance his own books or setting aside balance. He can even [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=4079.44s)]
*  assemble a team for his own company, which is only doing $821,000 in net sales. He thinks that that is [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=4088.4s)]
*  too complex for what his accountants were able to do and therefore they're not effective and there [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=4099.5199999999995s)]
*  are now material weaknesses in their internal controls. That's like seven months of Pam Bondi's [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=4106.72s)]
*  contract with Qatar. That's all they did. These are the people who are running the most complex [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3QE_V3Hjc&t=4112.64s)]
