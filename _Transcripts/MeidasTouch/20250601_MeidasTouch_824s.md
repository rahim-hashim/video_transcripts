# World Leaders DESTROY Trump and PREPARE FOR WAR
**MeidasTouch:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs)
*  World leaders are building up their military forces, knowing that not only is America not reliable, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=0.0s)]
*  it's outright antagonistic. We see headlines like the following. Prime Minister Carney of Canada [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=6.24s)]
*  says he wants Canada to join the major European defense plan, looking away from the United States [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  towards Europe. You have headlines about the new chancellor of Germany, Friedrich Maars, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  saying that Germany is eyeing the strongest EU army by 2031. Chancellor Friedrich Maars plans to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=26.08s)]
*  make his army the strongest conventional army in Europe. Other EU countries also have ambitious [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=34.4s)]
*  plans for their armed forces. A massive military buildup is underway. And you have people like [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=41.28s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron making statements that in the past would probably seem to be [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=48.4s)]
*  not as diplomatic with the United States president, but a credibility test for the Americans is how [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=55.44s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron is phrasing it. French President Emmanuel Macron calling out [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  Donald Trump for Trump's failures to respond to Putin and Putin constantly humiliating him. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=68.48s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron says the following quote, I spoke 48 hours ago with [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=74.72s)]
*  President Trump, who expressed his impatience. The question now is, what do we do about it? What are [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=79.68s)]
*  you going to do about it? We are ready in France. We are ready in Europe. President Macron said, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=86.0s)]
*  what are you doing, Donald? Meanwhile, you have President Zelensky in Ukraine saying the following. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  Rather than pressure. Pause. You all know who he's talking about, right? He's talking about Trump. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  Words do not work with Moscow. You know what he's talking about there as well. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump's all caps, social media posts. He goes on to say, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=120.4s)]
*  or partners. They haven't even shared the new agenda with Turkey, the country that hosted the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=139.68s)]
*  first meeting, although they promised the exact opposite. And above all, they promised it to the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=144.72s)]
*  United States, to President Trump, another Russian deception. They are doing everything to ensure the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=150.08s)]
*  meetings are meaningless. And that is yet another reason why there should be sufficient sanctions [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=156.24s)]
*  on Russia. Now, when you have people like Kellogg, one of Donald Trump's liaisons, who was at first [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=162.48s)]
*  the liaison to Russia and Ukraine, now just the liaison to Ukraine saying NATO expansion is a fair [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  concern for Putin. I mean, Keith Kellogg used to be someone who was standing up to Putin. How [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=178.88s)]
*  embarrassing can you be there? And when you see other statements of capitulation like Donald Trump [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=184.24s)]
*  saying two more weeks, two more weeks, two more weeks, the rest of the world says we're building [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=190.8s)]
*  up our armies. The United States is tapped out. The United States is done. Donald Trump put the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=195.68s)]
*  United States into the Trump dumpster. We're getting ready ourselves. Take a look at this [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=200.96s)]
*  compilation right here of Trump consistently saying two weeks, two weeks, two weeks. I'm giving him two [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  more weeks, two more weeks. That's Donald Trump's line about everything. Play this clip. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  I think we've been giving enough to get this. I'd rather tell you in about two weeks from now. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=220.8s)]
*  You keep saying two weeks about President Putin. What is two weeks? Give us, what is the actual [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=225.84s)]
*  date? What is the timeline? Two weeks or less. And if it's a little more at the time, I say, but, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=231.52s)]
*  you know, they're losing a lot of people. See those little dates up at the top, April 27th, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  May 19th. Today is May 28th. So two weeks, two weeks, two weeks. Now we're still two weeks away. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=242.08s)]
*  And meanwhile, you have the United States acting deputy permanent representative to the UN, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=247.6s)]
*  John Kelly, saying that the United States will walk away from peace talks if Russia continues [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=255.6s)]
*  the war. So if Russia continues, then US disengages. What kind of incentive structure is that? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=262.0s)]
*  In doing so, we're not abandoning our principles or our friends. Rather, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=268.88s)]
*  we are recognizing Russia's refusal to work with us to achieve the desired outcome. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  We condemn Russia's decision over the weekend to launch some of its largest [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=278.32s)]
*  Michelin drone strikes on Ukraine. This does not demonstrate a desire for peace. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  The deal being offered now is the best possible outcome for Russia. Putin must make a deal. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=286.56s)]
*  If one side proves unable or willing to do so, it will bear the consequences. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  Additional sanctions against Russia are still being considered. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=296.8s)]
*  As my buddy Jay and Keeve writes, and there it is. If Putin doesn't agree to stop the massacre in [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=300.8s)]
*  Ukraine, Trump will obey his Russian master and bow down, taking the Russian cash like he always [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=305.92s)]
*  wanted to do. It was all theater to pacify the electorate that understands that Ukraine must win. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=312.0s)]
*  This season, I'm using Beekeepers Naturals products daily to proactively support my immune [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=320.0s)]
*  system. Especially as we enter peak travel and busy season through spring and summer, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=325.36s)]
*  there's nothing worse than getting sick right before a big trip. Beekeepers Naturals Nasal [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=331.04s)]
*  Spray and Nasal Spray Max helps clear my congestion. It soothes and moisturizes the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=336.32s)]
*  nasal passages so I can breathe deeply and easily. Beekeepers Naturals Sinus Support supports healthy [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  histamine levels and promotes reduced sinus irritation and provides immune support. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  Both products contain propolis that reduces the histamine response that compass irritation for [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=354.8s)]
*  eyes, nose, and throat. Propolis is their hero ingredient, the medicine of the beehive that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=361.12s)]
*  delivers antioxidants, vitamin C, iron, B vitamins, and uniquely beneficial compounds that support [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=368.16s)]
*  immune health. Not only are these products effective, I love Beekeepers Naturals mission [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=375.52s)]
*  of reinventing the medicine cabinet, merging modern science with natural medicine to create [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=381.04s)]
*  clean, non-toxic products that actually work. Today Beekeepers Naturals is offering Midas Touch [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=386.72s)]

*  I want to show you also, this is not getting a lot of attention, it's why I think it's vital for our [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=417.6s)]
*  platform here on the Midas Touch Network to show you how the Trump regime is trying to, I mean, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=423.2s)]
*  I think this is doing Putin's bidding right here, influence elections of candidates who are supported [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=430.4s)]
*  by Putin and sympathetic to Putin around the world. The organization in the United States [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=437.92s)]
*  called CPAC, which used to stand for the Conservative Political Action Committee or conference, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=443.44s)]
*  basically became a right-wing MAGA nutcase thing, ultra MAGA extremist thing. They hold events now [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=450.08s)]
*  in European countries and right before there's a European election, like the election that's [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=458.64s)]
*  right here in the election in Poland, there's a far right-wing candidate and there is a centrist [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=464.24s)]
*  European Union candidate. And so what CPAC does, they hold conferences in places like Poland, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=473.52s)]
*  in Hungary, and then Trump regime officials go into these countries to try to influence the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=481.12s)]
*  elections to get Putin puppets elected. It's right in front of our eyes that Trump is sending [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=487.2s)]
*  his cabinet level people to try to help Putin's puppets take over these countries. So I'll give [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=493.44s)]
*  you the example. In the past 48 hours, you had dog killer cosplayer, US Homeland Security Secretary, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=499.84s)]
*  Kristi Noem, simping for Karol Norocki, the right-wing, far right-wing extremist, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  Putin-backed candidate saying that he should be the next president of Poland. And he or she was [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=517.76s)]
*  attacking the mayor of Warsaw, the pro-EU, pro-democracy candidate. But you'll see, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=523.76s)]
*  this is a perfect example, CPAC in America trying to influence and interfere in foreign elections. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=532.48s)]
*  And remember we saw that in Germany, we see it all over the place, but take a look at Kristi [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=540.8000000000001s)]
*  Noem in Poland. Play this clip. The US Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, said that Karol [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=544.88s)]
*  Nowrocki should be the next president of Poland. Speaking at the CPAC conference in Zeszów, in [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  Poland's southeast, Noem also criticized his runoff rival and Warsaw mayor, Rafał Trzaskowski. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=557.84s)]
*  I just had the opportunity to meet with Karol and listen, he needs to be the next president of [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=563.6s)]
*  Poland. Do you understand me? It matters who's in charge. I have watched over the years as socialists [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=568.1600000000001s)]
*  and people that are just like this mayor out of Warsaw, that is an absolute train wreck of a leader, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=576.72s)]
*  have destroyed our countries because they have led by fear. They have used fear to control people [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=582.88s)]
*  and they've used fear to promote an agenda that is not what liberty is about. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=591.92s)]
*  Right. You didn't see that on US media, right? And she didn't repost that clip on her social media. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=598.72s)]
*  She posted a clip with herself and the current president of Poland, a guy named Andrzej [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=605.76s)]
*  Duda, and he is also kind of a right-wing guy, although not as far right-wing as this [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=612.64s)]
*  Karol guy who's running. So she showed that, oh, I'm just doing, I'm here to talk with the president [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=619.92s)]
*  of Poland. And the parliamentary system of Poland, they have a president, they have a prime minister. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=626.7199999999999s)]
*  Their prime minister is a significant, is a more powerful position than the president and is a pro-EU [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=632.16s)]
*  pro-democracy guy. But that's what she was doing there. You saw that clip. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=640.96s)]
*  Here's Donald Trump making a video of himself. There was also a CPAC going on in Hungary, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=645.44s)]
*  where many expect in the next election, Viktor Orban, the right-wing authoritarian, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=650.88s)]
*  Putin-backed guy in Hungary is going to lose. But you'll see Donald Trump making this video [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=656.8s)]
*  for the CPAC, the American organization CPAC throwing events in Hungary, play this clip. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=661.92s)]
*  You know how I feel about Hungary and you know how I feel about CPAC. I really respect and love [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=667.44s)]
*  them both. I also want to pay a very special regard to the leader of Hungary, Viktor Orban, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=674.64s)]
*  who's a great man and highly respected by everybody. He's done a brilliant job of [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=682.5600000000001s)]
*  leading and he's a very, very special person. And as far as CPAC is concerned, all over the world, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=688.8000000000001s)]
*  they're respected as an organization. They have conservative values, but the conservative values [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=695.28s)]
*  are very good values. And that I can tell you, they want strong borders. They want law and order. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=701.52s)]
*  They want all of the things that you want. They feel strongly about the military. It's got to be [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=706.72s)]
*  fair. It's got to be just. It's got to be all of the things that you want to make a country great [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=712.64s)]
*  and to make your life great. So I just want to thank everybody and again, to Matt and Mikolos [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=717.76s)]
*  and all of the people, all of my friends there. We appreciate you being there and enjoy it. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=724.72s)]
*  Enjoy your lives. I'll see you soon. I think it's worth noting as well that there's so many [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=731.2800000000001s)]
*  things that Donald Trump has done to harm America, harming our alliances, destroying our federal [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N15lxKUHLs&t=737.84s)]
