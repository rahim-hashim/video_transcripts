# Trump Witness gets CRUSHED during CROSS-EXAM at Hearing
**MeidasTouch:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE)
*  Why would you hollow out the resources there and the people that are enforcing the Borough [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=0.0s)]
*  Defense Rule when we have these terrible numbers of exploitation of students? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=4.32s)]
*  Well, and my point is that we shouldn't just focus on those schools. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=9.44s)]
*  I do know that I totally agree with you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  There are some scam universities out there. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=15.32s)]
*  Why would you hollow out the people who are supposed to enforce it? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=17.96s)]
*  Because I think we're putting other measures in place, but the scam... [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=21.42s)]
*  Give me an idea what you're putting in place that's better than the Borough Defense Rule. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=24.12s)]
*  Well, we just talked a little bit about FAFSA. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=27.56s)]
*  And it's the education up front. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=29.32s)]
*  So that's... [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=31.52s)]
*  I'm talking about the victims, the ones who are already victims. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=32.52s)]
*  They're in debt by tens of thousands of dollars. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=35.16s)]
*  They're living in their parents' basement. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=37.84s)]
*  They have no place to turn. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=39.56s)]
*  And you're telling me the FAFSA form application is going to help them? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=41.36s)]
*  How can it help them? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=45.72s)]
*  And that's not in place yet, but I think that's going to be very, very helpful. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=46.72s)]
*  Here's the other thing. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=50.24s)]
*  Where are our guidance counselors in high schools? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=51.32s)]
*  Who are they talking to? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=54.8s)]
*  Good question. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=55.8s)]
*  I think that they need to be thoroughly informed, and I think they need to look at the cost [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=57.76s)]
*  of education. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=61.8s)]
*  You're cutting the number of counselors in these schools at the same time. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=62.8s)]
*  Well, the counselors that are doing their jobs can provide information to these students. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  There aren't enough of them. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=70.6s)]
*  That's the point I'm making. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=72.08s)]
*  And the situation is terrible for these students. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=73.4s)]
*  First generation students who are being exploited by these schools, they need your protection. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=76.22s)]
*  They need our protection. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=80.72s)]
*  They deserve it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=81.72s)]
*  They're doing the right thing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=82.88s)]
*  And unfortunately, you're reducing the number of people to enforce the law. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=84.28s)]
*  Democrats in the Senate are cross-examining Donald Trump's cabinet members, continue to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=88.56s)]
*  expose some of the unlawful conduct, particularly the impoundment of funds that were meant to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=94.12s)]
*  go to places like the Department of Education. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=100.44s)]
*  So on Tuesday, the Secretary of Education, though it pains me to say that, Linda McMahon [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=103.92s)]
*  was testifying before the Senate. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=111.84s)]
*  Watch Democratic Senator Murray's questions, making it very clear that the funds were appropriated [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  to go to the Department of Education and they're not going there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=122.84s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  For example, your FY26 budget request zeros out dedicated funding for literacy education [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=126.92s)]
*  programs and your operating plan for this year describes this funding as unallocated. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=133.8s)]
*  So will you allocate the $220 million for literacy programs that Congress appropriated [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=139.48s)]
*  for FY25? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=145.6s)]
*  Senator, as I mentioned earlier, we are looking at the unallocated dollars now to determine [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=148.6s)]
*  which of those programs we can best spend those dollars on. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=153.44s)]
*  And I'll be happy to give back to you. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=157.12s)]
*  And we want to work with Congress on those unallocated dollars to see where they could [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=158.48s)]
*  be spent the best. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=162.1s)]
*  What is your plan to make sure that that funding actually gets to the schools and students [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=163.88s)]
*  who's intended to support? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=167.44s)]
*  We're running out of time here. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, to look at those programs and to them and then to allocate them to the states. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=169.8s)]
*  If those programs we believe is the best interest for those students. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  Those funds are appropriated by Congress. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=176.72s)]
*  Your department was to allocate them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=179.0s)]
*  And it really looks to me like the department is illegally impounding funding that would [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=181.36s)]
*  help our students succeed with plans that don't exist and just day after day going by [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=186.14000000000001s)]
*  here. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's our concern. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, let us work more with you as we update those allocations as we did before. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  When do you plan to have those funds out by? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=196.68s)]
*  Well, the funds that we are approving will go out in this year. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=199.0s)]
*  Like in this next month or in the fiscal year? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=204.44s)]
*  You're running out of time. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=209.04s)]
*  So we need we need to see what the plan is. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=210.04s)]
*  You could provide. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=211.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=212.76s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=213.76s)]
*  Next up, you have Democratic Senator Murphy asking her what authority do you have to do [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=214.76s)]
*  this? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=220.16s)]
*  What makes you think you're able to engage in the types of conduct you are here? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=221.16s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=225.28s)]
*  I'm going to understand what the Department of Education is doing with respect to the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=226.96s)]
*  threats you've made against institutions of higher education in the letter that you sent [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=230.96s)]
*  to Harvard demanding that they make certain changes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=235.96s)]
*  You told them that they had to end all of their diversity programs, but that they had [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=239.96s)]
*  to institute viewpoint diversity. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=245.68s)]
*  That doesn't seem to make sense. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=249.68s)]
*  How do you tell them to end all the diversity programs? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=252.28s)]
*  This is a mandate that you will make of other schools as well. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=256.64s)]
*  How do you ask them to end diversity programs while instituting viewpoint diversity? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=259.64s)]
*  This seems to be totally contradictory. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=266.64s)]
*  No, the diversity programs that we've asked and demanded to be eliminated were the DEI [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=268.64s)]
*  where they were. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=274.64s)]
*  Those programs actually were pitting one group against another. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=275.64s)]
*  Isn't viewpoint diversity a diversity program? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=279.64s)]
*  Viewpoint diversity is an exchange of ideas that's actually better. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=283.32s)]
*  Here, because Harvard only has 3% by its own numbers, 3% conservative faculty, do you think [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=287.32s)]
*  they are allowing enough of viewpoint diversity through that teaching? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=293.12s)]
*  Where in the statute does it give you the ability to cut off federal funding for a university [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=297.12s)]
*  based upon your decision, your determination that they don't have viewpoint diversity? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=302.12s)]
*  Can you cite to a statute an authority that Congress has given you to micromanage the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=306.84s)]
*  viewpoint diversity of a college? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=311.4s)]
*  Well, certainly if... [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=313.4s)]
*  Well, let's back up. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=315.4s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=316.4s)]
*  I think that's really important. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=317.4s)]
*  Can you cite a statute? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=318.4s)]
*  You can't cut off funding for universities unless you have a statutory authorization [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=322.4s)]
*  to do so. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=327.08s)]
*  What statute gives you the right to tell any university that they have to have a certain [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=328.23999999999995s)]
*  mixture of viewpoints? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=332.91999999999996s)]
*  Here's what happened with Harvard. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=334.4s)]
*  It was the same with Columbia. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=336.4s)]
*  I don't mean to be... [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=338.4s)]
*  I don't mean to provide a... [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=339.4s)]
*  Being hostile to Harvard, but... [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=340.4s)]
*  Well, I have to give you some background. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=341.4s)]
*  I think you have to cite the statute. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=342.4s)]
*  The statute is Title VI. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=343.4s)]
*  These were civil rights violations. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=346.4s)]
*  That is why we filed a case and defunded or stopped the funding for a while for Harvard, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=348.4s)]
*  as well as we did Columbia. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=352.96s)]
*  And in that conversation with them, we talked about different things that they should do [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=354.67999999999995s)]
*  coming back to the table to make their programming better. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=359.56s)]
*  The president of Columbia absolutely indicated, as well as the president of Harvard, that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=362.67999999999995s)]
*  they needed to do things on their campus to eliminate anti-Semitism. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=367.64s)]
*  That was kind of the crux of what brought us into talking to the different universities. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=371.4s)]
*  And then we sat down with them to say, okay, these are other issues that you need to address [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=375.76s)]
*  on your campus because you do receive federal funding. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=381.0s)]
*  Under federal funding, if you are breaking the law, which they did under Title VI. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  I don't understand any conception of civil rights law to give you the authorization to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=388.76s)]
*  micromanage viewpoint diversity on campus. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=393.96s)]
*  That's not authorized under the civil rights title provided to you by the United States [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=397.72s)]
*  Congress. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=401.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=402.8s)]
*  Senator Merkley. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=403.8s)]
*  Using a civil rights statute to attack diversity and civil rights. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=405.52s)]
*  I don't think George Orwell could write that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=411.56s)]
*  Let's bring in the president of the American Federation of Teachers, Randy Weingarten. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=413.44s)]
*  You're seeing that hearing taking place on Tuesday. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=418.36s)]
*  I guess first, your immediate reaction to the hearing that's been taking place. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=422.08s)]
*  Then I want to talk about the disastrous budget bills impact on education. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=427.36s)]
*  First off, thank you for having me. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=431.64s)]
*  But let me take a step back, which is that these laws were passed, I don't know, 60, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=436.4s)]
*  70 years ago, because the country from before the civil war, we had a constitution that [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=445.28s)]
*  initially said someone who was a slave had no rights to vote and was considered a three-fifths [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=456.12s)]
*  person. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=464.88s)]
*  And we have been over the course of close to 250 years attempting to create equality [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=466.28s)]
*  of all, opportunity of all. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=476.23999999999995s)]
*  That is what the civil rights laws were about to say, if people don't have an equal opportunity, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=479.91999999999996s)]
*  then there needs to be ways to create that opportunity. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=489.88s)]
*  So what Linda McMahon is doing is just basically throwing out those laws and essentially saying [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=494.44s)]
*  that they are going to weaponize the legal mechanics, but throw out the reason we had [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  those laws. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=512.8s)]
*  It's not just Orwellian. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=515.24s)]
*  It's so mind-boggling because it just assumes that no one reads, writes, or thinks about [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=518.16s)]
*  what we need to do in terms of opportunity. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=526.92s)]
*  In listening to the questions and listening to our answers, I'm just blown away by the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=531.04s)]
*  dehumanization and the weaponization of a law that was about equal opportunity that's [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=543.68s)]
*  now being turned on its head. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=550.64s)]
*  You and I spoke about two months ago. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=552.88s)]
*  Where are we today versus where we are then? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=558.16s)]
*  So I'm both more hopeful and more fearful at the same time. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  I say I'm more hopeful. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=571.52s)]
*  It is exactly what we said two months ago, but they have revealed themselves more. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=573.72s)]
*  Meaning, at that point, they were starting to break a lot of things, both in terms of [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=580.72s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=589.28s)]
*  Let's just talk about education. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=590.48s)]
*  They tried to condition aid. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=592.86s)]
*  They tried to stop appropriations. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=594.6s)]
*  They tried to basically say that anything any of us did that actually met the needs [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=596.4s)]
*  of children or if we said to a child, how are you doing today, somebody could have construed [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=604.16s)]
*  that to be DEI. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=613.64s)]
*  It's ridiculous on its face. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=615.0799999999999s)]
*  If we taught about Jim Crow, somebody could say you could take all of our federal funding [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=616.88s)]
*  from either colleges or from K-12. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=624.76s)]
*  If we said if there was an anti-Semitic incident on campus, which there have been many and [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=630.4s)]
*  which we need to do a much better job, creating a safe and welcoming environment, you could [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=637.36s)]
*  take away huge research funding. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=642.24s)]
*  So basically, they were breaking a lot of things and ignoring Congress and defying the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=645.18s)]
*  courts and slowly, the courts have basically said no, you can't do that. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=650.96s)]
*  More often than not, the Trump administration is now listening to what the courts are saying. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=657.1600000000001s)]
*  They'll appeal or they won't appeal, but they have not actually completely disrupted this [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=662.4000000000001s)]
*  school year, at least in terms of K-12. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=668.76s)]
*  But more important than that, equally important to that, people finally are saying, not here. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=672.6s)]
*  We didn't vote to get rid of 14 million people being off their health care. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=680.16s)]
*  We didn't vote to get rid of basically every single federal dollar that goes in to help [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=686.68s)]
*  kids read or to help kids who have disabilities. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=693.12s)]
*  This is not what we voted for. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=699.24s)]
*  We voted for you, Donald Trump, to help us have a better economy, to help us have a better [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=700.62s)]
*  life, not a worse life. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=705.12s)]
*  So I would say we've slowed them down in terms of the breaking of government and the breaking [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=707.24s)]
*  of things to make it so completely chaotic. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=713.94s)]
*  And there's also a lot of people on the ground in communities all across the country that [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=717.88s)]
*  are saying, this is not America. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=723.88s)]
*  This is not what we wanted. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=726.76s)]
*  And in a couple of weeks, we're going to have yet another very big protest. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=730.88s)]
*  So think about what's going to happen. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=734.84s)]
*  Donald Trump, on his birthday, is going to have a military parade in Washington. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=736.8199999999999s)]
*  He's cut all this funding or wants to cut all this funding for people on health care [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=743.52s)]
*  or people who need nutritious meals. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=749.12s)]
*  But he's finding a way to pay for a military parade for his birthday. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=751.38s)]
*  And then all across the rest of the country, there's going to be what an eighth grader [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=756.3199999999999s)]
*  in one of the protests I've seen has a great sign that says, I've learned in school that [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=761.12s)]
*  presidents are not kings. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=766.04s)]
*  And that's what the people around the country are going to be saying as Donald Trump is [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=767.88s)]
*  having his military parade. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=772.64s)]
*  The no kings protest. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=775.3199999999999s)]
*  June 14th, we'll be covering it here on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=776.88s)]
*  Finally, before we wrap, talk to us about the American Federation of Teachers, what [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=781.28s)]
*  you are all doing right now to kind of fight back and what you want others to know about [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=786.0s)]
*  your efforts. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=791.5999999999999s)]
*  So, number one, this fight back can't just be a fight back. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=792.64s)]
*  People who voted for Donald Trump, I'm putting aside people who are just, you know, that [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=797.76s)]
*  people who will always support anything that he says. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=806.68s)]
*  I'm talking about the people at the last minute who made a difference and voted for [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=809.76s)]
*  Donald Trump. They voted for him to make a difference in their lives. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=814.64s)]
*  They thought that he would actually make the economy work for working class people. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=820.0799999999999s)]
*  And I think we all have to not only fight for democracy, but actually have to fight [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=827.04s)]
*  for an America that's going to help working class people. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=833.68s)]
*  So for me, I think there should be a tax cut for working class people. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=837.8s)]
*  I think we should have a tax cut to ensure that the first dollars that it really costs [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=842.84s)]
*  to live for working class folk, that should be the tax cut, not a tax cut that prefers [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=850.36s)]
*  people who have passive income that have gained gazillions of dollars on that passive [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=857.72s)]
*  income. Number two, we have to fight to make sure that there's a voice for everyone. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=862.68s)]
*  And that's what it means to have a democracy that works. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=868.6s)]
*  That's why we're going to the courts, but the court of public opinion. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=871.88s)]
*  That's why we have education to actually make sure that people can problem solve, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=876.52s)]
*  critically think our kids have the tools that they need for the future. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=882.0s)]
*  So when we fight for funding for that, we don't want a piggy bank that takes the funding [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=887.1999999999999s)]
*  away for private schools. People want to send their kids to private schools. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=892.52s)]
*  They have a right to do it. But we need the money for public schools. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=895.84s)]
*  We need the money for kids with disabilities. We need the money for kids who are poor. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=899.84s)]
*  We need the money for kids who want to go into career tech ed. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=903.52s)]
*  We need the money for research and science to solve cancer. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=906.28s)]
*  So we need to actually make sure that people understand that our fight is not against [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=910.88s)]
*  Donald Trump. Our fight is for people to have a better life. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=916.6800000000001s)]
*  That's what America is. And our fight is focused on the economy and on democracy to do [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=921.6s)]
*  that. That's what America's teachers are doing. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=927.16s)]
*  That's what America's nurses are doing. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=929.48s)]
*  We are fighting for people to be able to thrive, particularly our children. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=931.36s)]
*  Randy Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, will check back in [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w3QawG75DE&t=937.3199999999999s)]
