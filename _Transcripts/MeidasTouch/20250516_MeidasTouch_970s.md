# Trump holds DISASTER PRESSER as Trip IMPLODES
**MeidasTouch:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU)
*  Let me set the stage of this disastrous press conference that Donald Trump had in the United Arab Emirates. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=0.0s)]
*  He's sitting there in a royal palace with an authoritarian regime, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=5.84s)]
*  and he's attacking the United States court system and talking about how he wants to get rid of migrants in the United States. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=10.88s)]
*  And he's using the United Arab Emirates royal palace as the backdrop for it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  In Abu Dhabi, here play this clip. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=25.36s)]
*  I vote because I built hundreds of miles of wall, which we didn't have in the first election because I hadn't started that yet. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=27.68s)]
*  But we will soon have a very safe country. We're getting people out. We need help from the courts. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=35.2s)]
*  The courts are trying to think that they're taking privilege that they shouldn't have. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  That was not what the election was all about. The election was they want people that shouldn't be there, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=46.0s)]
*  people that are criminals in many cases. They want them out. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=53.6s)]
*  They want them out. We're going to get them out fast. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=56.64s)]
*  That's what you are talking about. They're attacking our court system. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=59.04s)]
*  And then while Donald Trump was with the royal family in the United Arab Emirates, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=62.96s)]
*  he was saying the word groceries is such an interesting word. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=67.84s)]
*  You know, it's an old fashioned word, groceries, groceries. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=71.28s)]
*  While Americans are suffering, you are in a palace with a royal family begging for personal gifts for you, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=75.04s)]
*  acting like you don't know the word groceries. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=82.64s)]
*  It means jobs because to me the most important jobs, I want jobs. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  And we have costs are way down. Groceries, they have a term grocery. It's an old term, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=90.32s)]
*  but it means basically what you're buying food. It's a pretty accurate term, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=97.36s)]
*  but it's an old fashioned sound. But groceries are down, costs are down, eggs are down. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=101.44s)]
*  First week they were hitting me with eggs were up 200 percent. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=107.12s)]
*  And now they're down to a number that is amazing with down 97, 98 percent from where they were. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=112.08s)]
*  And everybody they said you won't have eggs for Easter. Well, we had everybody had eggs for Easter [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=119.68s)]
*  at a very reasonable price at the White House. We had a little Easter egg roll and we had [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=125.68s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of eggs purchased. They said you have to go out and buy plastic eggs. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=131.44s)]
*  That didn't work out. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  So it is not a surprise when we saw the results today that the University of Michigan consumer [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=137.52s)]
*  expectations are showing that right now consumers have the lowest expectations, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  are more miserable essentially than ever in the United States history and believe that inflation [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=149.68s)]
*  is going to be the highest essentially ever because of crap like this and because of his [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=156.8s)]
*  reckless behavior. I mean here Donald Trump then says, well, we're going to we're still [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=162.4s)]
*  working on deals with 150 countries and my tariffs against the world. But if they don't [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=167.36s)]
*  agree to deals, then I'm just going to impose the deals myself. That's not a deal, Donald. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=172.72s)]
*  If you're just imposing it because you're unable to negotiate things with anybody [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=178.4s)]
*  because no one wants to do business with you and what you did with China is not a deal. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=183.12s)]
*  You just capitulated. Here play this clip. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=187.44s)]
*  As you know, with the United Kingdom, which was wonderful. And we have another big one that we [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=192.4s)]
*  just reached with China. China deals a very big deal. It's in the process of continuing to be [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  formed, but they wanted to make that deal very badly. And we have at the same time, 150 countries [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=205.68s)]
*  that want to make a deal, but you're not able to see that many countries. So at a certain point [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  over the next two to three weeks, I think Scott and Howard will be sending letters out, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=218.8s)]
*  essentially telling people. I would be very fair, but we'll be telling people [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=224.24s)]
*  what they'll be paying to do business in the United States. So essentially be paying to be [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=229.52s)]
*  doing business in the United States. I guess you could say they could appeal it, but for the most [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=235.68s)]
*  part, I think we're going to be very fair, but it's not it's not possible to meet the number of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=240.24s)]
*  people that want to see us. And but this was coming to UAE was very important coming to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=244.96s)]
*  Saudi Arabian Qatar was very important to me because of personal relationships that I had, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=252.96s)]
*  maybe more than anything else. And other countries don't want to look like what happened in the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=258.16s)]
*  United Kingdom either, where there wasn't a deal at all, where it was actually just a benefit to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=263.04s)]
*  Jaguar and Land Rover and Rolls Royce. I was like, what was this? What is this? What is this thing [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=269.28s)]
*  right here? And then here Donald Trump says, you know, just in his own kind of just like cognitive [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=275.84s)]
*  declining stewing in whatever the hell he's wearing. He's just like, there's never been anything [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=281.76s)]
*  like what's happening in the US. Never in the history. There's never been anything like, like [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=287.28s)]
*  actually never been anything like this. Here, play this clip. And they, I said, just build your plant [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=291.68s)]
*  inside the United States and you have no tariffs. And that's exactly what they're doing. And that's [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=297.84s)]
*  what many, many companies are doing. The auto companies, all of them. There's never been [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=301.76s)]
*  anything like what's happening right now to the United States. I can tell you nothing. There's [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=308.0s)]
*  never been anything like it. We're at a level that no country has seen. I don't believe we have. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=312.56s)]
*  I mean, every time I meet, I end, I usually increase it by about a trillion dollars because [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=321.12s)]
*  we get news of another investment, but we're probably in the 12 to 13 trillion dollar range [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=326.4s)]
*  of investments. And if by there's never been anything like this, you mean like the biggest [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=332.96s)]
*  disaster ever, the biggest manufactured economic crisis. Sure. Sure. Donald, by the way, that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=338.96s)]
*  follows Donald Trump leaving Qatar. And when Donald Trump was in Qatar, he was saying to the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=346.4s)]
*  troops in Qatar in Doha, lying about the 2020 election, saying that he won the 2020 election, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  which he didn't. And then talking about how he wants to potentially run again in 2028 and be a [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  dictator. And he's doing it in front of our freaking troops here. Play this clip right here. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=365.84s)]
*  Because as you know, we won three elections. OK, and some people want us to do a fourth. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=370.8s)]
*  I don't know. I have to think about that. You saw the new the new hat. The hottest hat is [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=377.2s)]
*  it says Trump 2028. We're driving the left crazy when you see that. We didn't need that hat, but [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=382.48s)]
*  it was it's been an amazing period of time. Now, I just wanted to see, by the way, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=392.32s)]
*  how this trip was being covered by sources on the quote left, right and center. And so the research [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=397.52000000000004s)]
*  tool I use for this is something called ground news. Let me just show you how it's being reported [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  generally out there. Trump's Mideast trip splashes out on deals and diplomacy, but is quiet on human [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=409.6s)]
*  rights. Now, this is why I love ground news, because I can actually get like, OK, how's the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=417.76000000000005s)]
*  left center and right? And they're all covering it wrong. That's what my research tool tells me. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=423.12s)]
*  He's not splashing out on deals. He's failing on deals. These are fake deals. You're not making a [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=428.64000000000004s)]
*  $1.2 trillion deal with Qatar when the GDP annually is 200 billion dollars. OK, and yes, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=434.72s)]
*  he is quiet on human rights. If by quiet you mean he's complicit with the regime that's funding [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  Hamas and complicit with another regime that was funding Al Qaeda and start in terms of Saudi [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=446.64000000000004s)]
*  Arabia. Yeah, you are complicit in terrorism is what we're trying to say here. So let's use the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=451.92s)]
*  language accurately. By the way, it's why I use the research tool because I'm like, OK, I know [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=458.24s)]
*  here's what I'm reporting on Midas Touch. What the heck are they reporting there? I use their [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=462.32s)]
*  feature called Blind Spot, by the way, which tells me I'm by missing anything. Oh, just a quick [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=466.48s)]
*  shout out to ground news, who's a sponsor of ours. And if you want to use the research tools that I [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=471.59999999999997s)]

*  tools that I'm using here. Also, let's talk about what Donald Trump was doing in Qatar as well. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=503.12s)]
*  Here, Donald Trump's again, just like ranting and raving. And he like looks like literally an [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=509.36s)]
*  orange green color here. Play this clip time a third time. And that was nine hundred and sixty [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=515.28s)]
*  eight rallies ago. Can you believe that we did nine hundred and sixty eight roses? Another hat says [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=521.36s)]
*  nine sixty eight. I said, what the hell does that mean? That's the number of rallies. I said, you [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=526.56s)]
*  have to be kidding. But from the very beginning and we played Lee's song and it was the walk on. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=530.88s)]
*  And then for the last inauguration, I had every all the big singers. They wanted to do a song for [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=537.52s)]
*  me and they wanted to have me walk onto their song and my people. Oh, that would be nice. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=543.28s)]
*  I'd be nicer. And what I heard about it, we were all set. We had a lot of them. And I heard about [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  it. I said, I'm not switch. Are you kidding me? I'm not switching. So we stick with Lee. But [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=553.92s)]
*  there's nobody could have done better than Lee. And he's been so loyal and so great. And it's been [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=559.68s)]
*  really about nine years of that stuff. And, you know, we had really honestly, we had three [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=564.64s)]
*  unbelievable campaigns and it's been it's been an honor. And here Donald Trump kind of like [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=570.8s)]
*  mocks France in this speech. Let's play it for World War One because we won that war, too. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=576.24s)]
*  But think of it, I'm calling now. We love France, right? But I think we did a little more to win [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  the war than France did. Do we agree? You know, I don't want to be a wise guy. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=588.7199999999999s)]
*  But when Hitler made his speech at the Eiffel Tower, I would say that wasn't exactly ideal. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=593.5999999999999s)]
*  And I called up the president, Macron, good guy, by the way, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=601.04s)]
*  Donald, we are celebrating our victory over the Germans. Oh, that's wonderful. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=605.5999999999999s)]
*  Now, we don't take credit for what we do. And I said, What the hell every country I've spoken [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=611.52s)]
*  to in the last week is celebrating the war, but us is not terrible. We're not doing anything. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=616.24s)]
*  But us is not terrible. So we're going to be doing holidays. But I said it has to be a working [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=621.36s)]
*  holiday because we know you can only do so many of them. We have a lot of holidays. I'm not so [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=628.32s)]
*  sure we should have them. And you don't have to go to work. Our country has to go to work. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump in Qatar talking about Pete Buttigieg riding a bike that was occupying [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=638.4s)]
*  Donald Trump's attention. Apparently, let's play it. Tree comes down also, by the way. It's so [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=643.76s)]
*  intense. I mean, you see these trees being knocked down like like they're being sawed down by [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=648.16s)]
*  a top of the line timberman like like, you know, who? Sean Duffy. Do you know that Sean Duffy, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=653.68s)]
*  the head of the Transportation Department, who's working right now on the airports and [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=660.56s)]
*  getting a system because Biden didn't do a thing for four years and Pete Buttigieg was the head [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=664.88s)]
*  and he goes bicycle into work. He takes a bicycle to work. Can you believe he's he's running [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=671.8399999999999s)]
*  the biggest air system in the world and he takes a bicycle to work? What? And [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=677.28s)]
*  they say he's going to run for president. I don't see it. Who knows? Right. But I don't see it. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=681.92s)]
*  But when I look at what they've done, it's so horrible what they've done and the work they [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=687.4399999999999s)]
*  did do. They wasted billions of dollars and tried to hook up air systems to to copper and they tried [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=694.4s)]
*  to hook up copper to glass and the glass doesn't work with the copper. And they had 30,000 different [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=699.92s)]
*  contractors doing 30,000 jobs. And when they put it all together, they spent billions of dollars. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=707.36s)]
*  It didn't even come close to working and we're going to be giving out a brand new system. It's [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=713.04s)]
*  very important that we'll have the best system. And we think we know who that system is. But we [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=716.64s)]
*  have a lot of Donald Trump lies and says that he's speaking in Qatar and he claims that 100 percent [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=721.4399999999999s)]
*  of ISIS is gone now, which again is just simply just like a simply false. It's just a false [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=728.48s)]
*  statement. Why does it go up? You can finish it off right now, sir. I said, well, I don't know. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=733.12s)]
*  That's a lot. It's you know, it's a lot of people. Well, these people are not good people, sir. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=738.88s)]
*  These are not good people. You'll feel better about it. Well, they're not good people, but they're [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=744.48s)]
*  people, aren't they? And he goes, I said, you know what? Why don't you buzz them for a little while [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=749.12s)]
*  and maybe after a day or two of buzzing them, they'll surrender. They don't know about surrendering, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=753.76s)]
*  sir. Well, maybe they'll raise the white flag. They don't have a white flag, sir. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=757.84s)]
*  I said, well, give it a shot anyway. He said, all we're going to do is take a couple of bullet [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=762.72s)]
*  holes in our wings. You guys know about that, right? And I said, well, let's give it a shot. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=766.88s)]
*  And he calls up says, let me do the job, sir. I said, all right, do the job. And we defeated 100 [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=772.88s)]
*  percent of the ISIS caliphate in just a very short little period of time. Totally different from what [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=780.24s)]
*  I was told in Washington, D.C. by a bunch of fricking losers. OK, losers. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=786.4s)]
*  Donald Trump claims that we were losing one trillion dollars to China. And now we're not [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=793.84s)]
*  losing it because he had a trade embargo with China for 30 days, which is entirely false. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=800.16s)]
*  Let's play the clip. Fund is just pay off that we're making. We're making a lot of money. We had [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=805.76s)]
*  we had a situation six months ago. We were losing five billion dollars a day on trade. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=811.2800000000001s)]
*  Now we're making money on trade. Don't forget, we were losing a trillion dollars to China. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=819.7600000000001s)]
*  So we essentially went cold turkey with China for a period of a month. Therefore, we weren't losing [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=825.84s)]
*  a trillion dollars. And I think that's pretty simple, Scott. Right. Scott did a great job [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=831.44s)]
*  over there. They made a deal. They have great relationships with China. You might hear Donald [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=835.6800000000001s)]
*  Trump is with the United Arab Emirates royal family, and he thinks that the Olympics are going [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=839.76s)]
*  to be in Queens, which are in Los Angeles. And Queens is not very close to Los Angeles. And [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=847.2s)]
*  I mean, just look at it. We can't even hold a conversation with these people. Like he can't [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=852.8s)]
*  even he can't even speak in sentences. He doesn't even know where he is here. Play this clip to our [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=857.76s)]
*  airline. And finally, Mr. President, we just signed also the naming rights of the New York City [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=862.56s)]
*  Football Club by the hat. Oh, good. And we're spending over 800 million dollars. So where is [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=868.88s)]
*  in Queens? I know the area. Yeah, it's right next to city. I grew up in Queens. I know the area very [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=875.92s)]
*  well. Right next to city fuel. Oh, that's great. That's where they used to fix the cars. A lot of [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=882.88s)]
*  other things got fixed. A lot of things. That's a great site. So how many people that's 25,000. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=890.32s)]
*  Is it primarily for soccer? It's for soccer. And they'll do concerts there. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=899.84s)]
*  Will they be using that in the Olympics? It will be available to be used. Because it's, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=903.76s)]
*  it's prime, you know, for some of the games. I mean, Queens, it's going out to the net, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=910.08s)]
*  but it's prime. Yes, state of the art stadium. You can see. And here's one more clip from that trip. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=914.72s)]
*  Let's play it. I'm just thinking we have a president of the United States going to selling. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=920.24s)]
*  I think you think Biden would be doing it. I don't think so. But it's so important. I think [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=926.4799999999999s)]
*  I have to be a cheerleader for our country. That's why our country is doing so well. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=933.5999999999999s)]
*  And it's people like this. We appreciate it. Great job. Say hello to Larry. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=937.5999999999999s)]
*  I mean, can you get any more bizarre than that? Anyway, let me know what you think. Hit subscribe. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFhWrCoCrU&t=944.9599999999999s)]
