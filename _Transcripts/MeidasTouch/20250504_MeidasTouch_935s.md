# FURIOUS Japan issues MAJOR THREAT to Trump
**MeidasTouch:** [May 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU)
*  Japan's finance minister Katsunobu Kato had a powerful message for the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=0.0s)]
*  If you treat us in Japan with disrespect over these tariff negotiations, we could use the nuclear option. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  We have the largest holdings of U.S. treasuries in the world, totaling over one trillion. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=15.1s)]
*  You treat us with disrespect, Donald. We will dump those and we can crash the United States markets. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=22.7s)]
*  So don't test us, don't treat us with disrespect, don't dishonor us. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=29.2s)]
*  And Japan has objected to the way the United States has presented these trade proposals. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=35.4s)]
*  Now, this should be an easy deal to make with Japan. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=41.6s)]
*  We already had a trade deal with Japan in 2018 that Donald Trump negotiated. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=46.8s)]
*  And now that Donald Trump wants to dishonor Japan, treat Japan with disrespect, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=55.0s)]
*  Japan is objecting to the trade proposal. And right now there's been no deal. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=61.4s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump has told us what week after week after week, we're about to do a deal with Japan. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=67.3s)]
*  I'm about to do a deal with India and Japan. We're announcing it. It's right around the corner. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=73.4s)]
*  It's right around the corner. That has not taken place despite all of Donald Trump's lies [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=77.8s)]
*  that it's going to happen. And to me, this is a major indicator again, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=83.4s)]
*  because the deal with Japan should be the easiest deals. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=87.4s)]
*  Now, we got a whiff that things were going very bad when Japan's Prime Minister, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=91.2s)]
*  Aishiba, back on April 21st, 2025, said, we're not rushing into anything. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  We want to strike a fair deal. We don't want to be disrespected. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=104.5s)]
*  And Japan just can't keep on conceding things to the US without getting anything in return. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=109.0s)]
*  Japan is not going to do that. Then messages got out that a deal with Japan may not take days, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=116.2s)]
*  but maybe weeks away. And, you know, one of the things that we're learning about as well is, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=123.2s)]
*  and you see right here, Japan's lead tariff negotiator, Roise Akazawa, just says things just generally are not going good. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=129.7s)]
*  And Prime Minister Aishiba's administration saying, Japan's prepared to use its role as America's largest creditor, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=138.6s)]
*  as leverage in the trade talks. So if that's how our close allies are treating us, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=146.1s)]
*  how do you think the rest of the world is viewing us right now? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=152.4s)]
*  I want to just show you some data points here as well. Why is Japan saying this now? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=156.9s)]
*  Well, if you've been watching the Midas Touch Network, you know we've been following Prime Minister Aishiba's actions. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=161.7s)]
*  One of the things that Japan saw that they took big notice of, the elections in Canada. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=168.5s)]
*  You go, how could the elections in Canada impact Japan? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=175.2s)]
*  It's why on this network we have a global focus so you can see the connections. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=178.4s)]
*  The same reason that the Canadian elections also had a big impact on the Australian elections. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=183.7s)]
*  And it's the Trump effect. When Trump is dishonoring nations, treating nations like crap, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=190.2s)]
*  a resistance rises against Donald Trump. And if leaders are obsequious to Donald Trump [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=197.5s)]
*  and try to appease Donald Trump, they're punished at the ballot box. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=204.2s)]
*  Take a look at the Japan Times, for example. The Trump effect on elections is just beginning, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=209.0s)]
*  including in Japan. And this article talks about how the governing party in Japan is worried [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=215.89999999999998s)]
*  that the government could be toppled by the opposition party if they strike a bad deal with Trump, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  look weak, and they get mocked by Donald Trump. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  Let me show you an opposition party member of parliament. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  I've showed this clip before, but it's worth playing right now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=239.5s)]
*  Here's an opposition member and here's what he has to say. Here, play this clip. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=243.6s)]
*  What the United States is saying is completely unreasonable. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  The logic is all over the place and there's no consistency. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=251.1s)]
*  However, when Japan negotiates regarding what they're saying, well, to put it clearly, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=254.29999999999998s)]
*  it's close to extortion by juvenile delinquents. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=260.2s)]
*  If Japan gives in and follows their unreasonable demand, saying it's negotiation or a deal, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=265.5s)]
*  it will set a bad precedent and create a negative example. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=272.3s)]
*  If the extorter gains money once, it's certain that they will extort again. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=277.2s)]
*  The formula itself is a complete mess. I wasn't great at math, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=283.4s)]
*  but if that showed up in a math exam, it would definitely score zero. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=287.5s)]
*  That's why, although Minister Akazawa is serious and capable, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=292.8s)]
*  there is also concern about whether a serious person can handle it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=296.9s)]
*  Since they are not reasonable, they won't listen to reasonable things. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=301.9s)]
*  Although I said every option, you absolutely must not provide information to an unreasonable opponent. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=305.4s)]
*  If you get concessions that way, it will set a bad example. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=310.9s)]
*  Anyway, please do not give in to the extortion from the U.S. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=315.5s)]
*  Though it's really bad to say, but this is extortion. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=320.4s)]
*  If we listen to this, it will really become a bad example. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=324.5s)]
*  So you ever sit down to work and your brain just won't cooperate? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  That was me for so long. I find myself getting distracted scrolling through social media, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=330.7s)]
*  just totally unable to focus, especially with a job like this where I need to stay locked in, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=334.8s)]
*  productive, creative, and on top of the news, distractions aren't just annoying. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=339.0s)]
*  They can derail everything. Then I found Brain FM and it's been a game changer. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=343.0s)]
*  Brain FM is an app built for anyone seeking to boost productivity. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=347.2s)]
*  They create science-backed music that syncs brain patterns, helping you focus better, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  relax deeper and sleep easier. I use their Deep Work and creative modes daily. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  It's like flipping a switch in my brain. There's even a turbo mode specifically designed for ADHD support. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=358.90000000000003s)]
*  This isn't hype. Brain FM is the only music company supported by a National Science Foundation grant [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=364.7s)]
*  and just published a peer-reviewed study showing their patented tech improves attention and brainwave synchrony. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=369.9s)]

*  Going back to the other data point that I wanted to talk about with Trump's disrespect as well, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=387.4s)]
*  on Thursday, Donald Trump spoke where University of Alabama, he gave that disrespectful speech where he was doing the... [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=394.29999999999995s)]
*  Remember he was doing that move? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=403.4s)]
*  The whole thing was just so utterly weird. Go back and watch the video that I did on that for, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=406.09999999999997s)]
*  Ben, what the hell are you talking about? Go and watch it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=411.09999999999997s)]
*  But here Donald Trump says that the US can sell cars in Japan because it's tariffing the hell out of the United States. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=413.29999999999995s)]
*  Japan hasn't imposed a tariff on car imports since 1978. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=423.2s)]
*  Trump has no clue what the hell he's talking about. Play this clip. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=429.7s)]
*  Pretty soon, sooner than most people think, because that's what other countries have been doing to us, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=432.7s)]
*  just so you understand. They were tariffing the hell out of us. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=437.7s)]
*  We couldn't sell cars in Europe. We couldn't sell cars in China. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  We couldn't sell cars in Japan or anywhere else. We couldn't do anything. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=444.2s)]
*  Now, the Financial Times reported last week that Donald Trump is attacking Japan over a, quote, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=448.59999999999997s)]
*  bowling ball test that Donald Trump takes issue with, where Donald Trump says, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=456.09999999999997s)]
*  in Japan, in addition to tariffing our cars, which they don't, they drop bowling balls. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=462.9s)]
*  This is what Donald Trump says. Is it crazy? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=468.59999999999997s)]
*  They drop bowling balls on the roofs of our cars. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=471.09999999999997s)]
*  And then when the cars break, they say, we're not buying American. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=475.40000000000003s)]
*  Trump has, quote, puzzled trade negotiators in Tokyo after complaining about a test where he claims [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=479.7s)]
*  a bowling ball is dropped on a car. Japan does not carry out such tests. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=485.6s)]
*  Here's from April 24, 2025. This was Charles Gasparino from Fox's Big Scoop. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=492.8s)]
*  According to my sources, Gasparino warns, we've been here with Japan, but there has not been any deals yet with Japan. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=506.3s)]
*  It's all market manipulation. They go tell this to Wall Street. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=512.3s)]
*  They spike the stock prices for a few days. Then they get dumped. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=516.0s)]
*  Main Street gets hurt. And the billionaire oligarchs who get the tips from the Trump regime about when they're going to message these things and not do them. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=519.9s)]
*  They make money and we the people get absolutely screwed over these things right here. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=530.9s)]
*  Japan's press secretary, Kitamura Toshishiro, he was in the Philippines this past week talking about the bilateral relationships with the Philippines, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=537.6999999999999s)]
*  broader relations in the region as well. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=548.6s)]
*  Here's what he talks about in terms of dealing with Trump. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=551.8s)]
*  And I want you to, when you watch it, I want you to see how Japan's press secretary, Kitamura Toshishiro, just how composed he is and contrasted to Trump's behavior. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=555.2s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=567.0s)]
*  Our prime minister had a telephone conversation with President Trump early this month, and then they have decided to establish, to launch a ministerial dialogue between two countries. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=585.2s)]
*  And Minister Akazawa was designated as chief of negotiator, and he had already once ministerial discussions in Washington, D.C. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=597.4000000000001s)]
*  And now he's visiting Washington, D.C. to hold the second round of this negotiation. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=608.5s)]
*  And as for the U.S. tariffs issues, I think that the tariff actions could affect a lot on the global economy as well as this free trade system. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=615.3s)]
*  So we heard the concerns of the Japanese community this morning as well. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=628.6s)]
*  And we, based on those opinions, the concerns, we convey our message to our counterpart of the U.S. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=635.6s)]
*  And we hope that we can find out a good solution between two countries, which is not only good for two countries, but good for the world, including Philippines. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=643.6s)]
*  And finally, I had the opportunity a few weeks back to do this interview with the United States, the former U.S. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=656.7s)]
*  ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=665.5s)]
*  And if you want, when do we do? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=669.5s)]
*  We did this in March, mid-March, actually, I think. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=671.2s)]
*  We did it before the Liberation Day, you know, or liquidation day, right around then. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=675.0s)]
*  We were warning about this months ago, Japan, China, Philippines. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=680.6s)]
*  And it was important for me to give us the right, you know, to give you all the warnings because you could just follow the data. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=687.8s)]
*  If you speak to the experts and you follow the data, like if you follow the freight levels, if you follow the trucking volumes, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=693.7s)]
*  if you see the ships aren't coming into the ports on the West Coast, Long Beach, Seattle, East Coast, Boston, you go, oh, crap, we're going to run out of supplies. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=700.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to happen. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=710.4s)]
*  There's going to be a Tom Hanks moment. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=711.8s)]
*  I call it a Tom Hanks moment. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=713.6999999999999s)]
*  Remember, Donald Trump said, like a miracle, it's all going to go away with COVID. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=715.1999999999999s)]
*  And then Tom Hanks got it like, oh, shit, lockdown mode. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=719.3s)]
*  We're going to have a Tom Hanks moment soon with stuff not being on the shelves. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=722.8s)]
*  That's what's going to happen. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=729.0s)]
*  Anyway, here's former ambassador Rahm Emanuel to Japan. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=729.9s)]
*  That's why we had to get him on. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=734.0s)]
*  We need to speak to him about this. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=735.5s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=736.6999999999999s)]
*  Japan's the number one foreign direct investor in the United States for the last four years consecutively. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=737.6s)]
*  Over a million Americans or a million Americans work for Japanese companies and nearly half of their investment goes to manufacturing. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=743.1s)]
*  So it's a kind of, you know, we're going to kind of be penny wise and dollar foolish here. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=751.4s)]
*  Second, Japan hosts the largest military footprint the United States has anywhere in the world. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=756.9s)]
*  It's the only country that has a permanent aircraft carrier. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=763.1s)]
*  It is in the is the long pole in our deterrence against China in the Indo-Pacific. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=766.0s)]
*  And so, you know, nothing stays just in the economic lane. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=772.1s)]
*  It's a relationship. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=775.5s)]
*  So that means national security, diplomatic support. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=776.4s)]
*  It means political support and it means economic support and integration. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=778.9s)]
*  Second, imagine this. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=782.3s)]
*  When the United States wants to put further sanctions on China as it relates to export controls for high tech. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=784.8s)]
*  The only way it's successful is Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Dutch stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=791.3000000000001s)]
*  They're going to think real hard about whether we should stand with the United States or allow our companies to continue to export to China. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=797.5s)]
*  So, you know, relationships don't just have one lane. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=804.9000000000001s)]
*  It's a series of things you weigh equities against each other. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=809.0s)]
*  So I think this is very short sighted in this approach. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=812.1s)]
*  There's a way you could have approached as we did in years past, both when I worked for President Clinton. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=815.6s)]
*  We did the five pillars on trade, etc. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=820.1s)]
*  Japan now is the number one, as I said, number one foreign investor in the United States. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=822.7s)]
*  Nearly a million Americans work for them. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=826.8000000000001s)]
*  And of those half are in the manufacturing industrial space. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=828.8000000000001s)]
*  So powerful words from Japan saying, uh-uh, ain't happening. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=832.1s)]
*  We're prepared to use our treasury holdings if you dishonor and if you disrespect us. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=838.4s)]
*  Also, as we previously reported and Reuters and Karl Kintaniya did a good job of highlighting this too, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=845.1s)]
*  the Chinese government sent a letter a few weeks back to Japanese Prime Minister Ashiba calling for a coordinated response to U.S. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=850.3000000000001s)]
*  President Donald Trump's tariff measures. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=859.5s)]
*  They had a ministerial level meeting. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=862.8000000000001s)]
*  Japan, South Korea and China. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=866.9s)]
*  Does that sound familiar? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=871.5s)]
*  Former President Biden brought, that's why China did it. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=873.7s)]
*  That's why Xi Jinping did it. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=876.4000000000001s)]
*  He knows Trump's too stupid to get it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=877.8000000000001s)]
*  Former President Biden brought together those leaders in Washington together side by side, shoulder to shoulder as a deterrent to China. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=881.0s)]
*  It was the ultimate checkmate move. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=892.0s)]
*  Donald Trump took the checkmates and like took the turn them into checkers and then put them all over his face like a fool. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=894.1s)]
*  So it happened. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=903.6s)]
*  We'll keep you posted with more, but he can't do a deal with Japan. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=905.5s)]
*  No deal. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECArVLg8BJU&t=908.6s)]
