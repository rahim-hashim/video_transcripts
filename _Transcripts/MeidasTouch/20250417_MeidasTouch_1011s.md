# Fox News LOSES IT as Trump SUFFERS BAD NEWS
**MeidasTouch:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0)
*  State regime media known as Fox was in freefall yesterday as Donald Trump continued to collapse the market, collapse the economy, and as China and their leaders were mocking him. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=0.0s)]
*  You had Caroline Levitt, Donald Trump's chief propagandist, going on Fox and literally begging China to give Donald Trump a call and then saying, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  look, American consumers are the best China. Just give us a call, will you? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=23.3s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=27.6s)]
*  And China knows that too, Sean. And as President Trump directed me to say yesterday, it remains true tonight, the ball is in China's court. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=29.3s)]
*  They need to do business with the United States. They need the best thing on the face of the planet. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=36.6s)]
*  And that is the American consumer. And we have we are the best place in the world to do business. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=41.5s)]
*  The rest of the world knows that. And that's why Japan was here today to negotiate a trade deal. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=47.4s)]
*  That's supposed to be strength. That looks like total weakness to me. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=52.1s)]
*  I thought you had the cards, Donald. I thought you had the cards. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=56.6s)]
*  By the way, China is mocking Donald Trump for saying they don't have the cards. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=59.9s)]
*  Then Caroline Levitt kind of glitches here where she's like, I don't have any updates because I haven't spoke with Scott Besson, the Treasury Secretary. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=64.3s)]
*  Then she goes, I just spoke with the Treasury Secretary, Scott Besson. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=73.9s)]
*  It's like what in the world are you talking about? Caroline, play this clip. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=77.1s)]
*  I don't have an update for you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=80.5s)]
*  I actually just left a dinner with the president and Patty Moran and some great faith leaders in celebration of Holy Week. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=82.0s)]
*  So I haven't checked in with our Secretary of Treasury or Jameson Greer, our United States Trade Ambassador yet. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  However, I did run into the Secretary of Treasury and he told me the meetings were productive and they were moving along and they were here. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=93.6s)]
*  Then Donald Trump was on Fox and he makes this very strange, bizarre and outright disgusting comment about the Holocaust. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=100.4s)]
*  And he said some people were treated good here. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=108.4s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=111.10000000000001s)]
*  You know, the Holocaust as bad as it was, there were a lot of stories where people got helped. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=112.30000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they said there was zero. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=116.9s)]
*  He said all we got was slapped. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=119.9s)]
*  We didn't get helped. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  We got slapped. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=122.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  The hell is he even talking about? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=124.0s)]
*  Then you have Pam Bondi as Aaron Rupert says, grotesquely claiming Abrego Garcia's wife and children who are American citizens are better off without the husband and the dad here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=126.0s)]
*  They should be thankful to the Trump regime for putting them in the concentration camp in El Salvador. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=140.8s)]
*  This is what Attorney General Pam Bondi says. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=146.7s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=149.2s)]
*  And that child he had with her, they are safer tonight because he is out of our country and sitting in El Salvador where he belongs. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=155.7s)]
*  And then the Trump regime had this guy on Fox who kind of glitched yesterday when he was talking about whether or not we were going to experience a recession, which most economists believe we're heading into a recession, a great recession or even worse. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=166.89999999999998s)]
*  Watch this Trump regime official glitch on live TV. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=181.5s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=185.1s)]
*  And so financial markets are forward-looking. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=186.0s)]
*  They'll start to realize that CEOs are forward-looking. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=188.0s)]
*  They'll start to realize that also. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=190.8s)]
*  So is there volatility in the short run? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=192.3s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=194.2s)]
*  Is a recession possible? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=194.9s)]
*  Well, you know, it's not my base case, you know, but you know, making predictions is difficult for anyone. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=196.2s)]
*  So you ever go through your bank statement and you think like, what the hell am I still paying for this? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=202.9s)]
*  That was me a few weeks ago before I signed up for Rocket Money. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=207.5s)]
*  And I got to say this app is a game changer. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=209.70000000000002s)]

*  I opened it up and bam, there were three subscriptions I hadn't used in months. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=220.4s)]
*  Rocket Money helped me cancel them in just a few taps. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=224.5s)]

*  Back to Attorney General Pam Bondi here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=269.1s)]
*  She goes, every liberal journalist who called Abrego Garcia a Maryland man should be bowing down and apologizing to the Trump regime right now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=272.3s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=283.4s)]
*  El Salvador, he is sitting in a prison and every American should be thanking President Trump tonight and every liberal journalist who has called him a Maryland man and saying he was rightfully in this country should be apologizing tonight to President Trump. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=284.5s)]
*  Can we just cut to the chase right here? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=301.2s)]
*  Here's the file for Abrego Garcia. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=303.3s)]
*  You see it says no criminal history, no criminal charge. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=305.8s)]
*  So you could keep defaming this guy. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=310.7s)]
*  Look, I want to give the facts. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  One of the facts were in 2019, a cop who was disgraced who ended up pleading guilty to exchanging favors for like a sex worker and giving private data and like pled guilty. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=315.1s)]
*  This was an individual who claimed he had a confidential informant who told him that Abrego was a gang member from the Westerners in Long Island, which Abrego Garcia never lived in Long Island. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=328.6s)]
*  So it never made sense. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=342.0s)]
*  That's when they say, oh, he was a gang member. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=343.3s)]
*  He was a gang member. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=345.2s)]
*  It was based on a disgraced cop who ended up like pleading guilty to like giving it like confidential information to like a sex worker for favors. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=346.1s)]
*  That's who that comes from. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=355.7s)]
*  And then, okay, if ultimately you say that he is a bad guy, then you do do process and then you can deport him like the 2019 judge said just not to El Salvador where he's going to be killed. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=357.6s)]
*  We're a nation of law and order. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=369.70000000000005s)]
*  You go through a process. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=371.8s)]
*  You could have an outcome. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=372.90000000000003s)]
*  You put forward evidence. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=374.20000000000005s)]
*  That's the way our system works. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=375.40000000000003s)]
*  So what else did the state regime media want to do yesterday? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  Here their host, one of them, Erhardt. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=381.90000000000003s)]
*  She's married to Hannity. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=385.8s)]
*  She was this like other host was like eating bananas off the floor. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  And then they talked about how Pete Hegseth, now the defense secretary, when he worked at Fox, he would take cream cheese bagels off the floor and smear it on his face and then eat dirty bagels. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  This is what they talk about in Fox eating dirty bagels. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=404.90000000000003s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm saying survive in the world because there are germs everywhere. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=408.1s)]
*  Joe, let's put it to the test. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=411.1s)]
*  Shall we? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=412.8s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=415.6s)]
*  Two, no, no, but that's that's what you're going to eat. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=420.0s)]
*  That's so much on this. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=424.20000000000005s)]
*  No, please. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=426.40000000000003s)]
*  You work for every day. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=427.20000000000005s)]
*  Shoes walk around New York City. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  Okay, should we go ahead and call out sick for next week? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=436.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=439.1s)]
*  That is the wrong consistency. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=442.90000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to be really, I'm going to tell you what. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=444.7s)]
*  This guy is definitely auditioning for the Pete Hegseth scene. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=446.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=449.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=451.7s)]
*  Pete Hegseth would have a bagel with cream cheese. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=452.0s)]
*  He would drop it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=453.9s)]
*  It would land upside down the cream cheese on the floor and he had pick it up. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=454.5s)]
*  I'm like, wait, is there any hair on there? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=457.5s)]
*  It is so gross. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=460.59999999999997s)]
*  And he would just pop it in his mouth. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=461.4s)]
*  There's also remember that Pete did not wash his hands. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=462.9s)]
*  He said that one time on air. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=467.2s)]
*  In every scenario, he would wash his hands. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=468.3s)]
*  He's like an army guy and he's tough. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=470.0s)]
*  I tough is one thing, but. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=472.59999999999997s)]
*  I bet you thought that like, come on, Ben. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=474.8s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=477.3s)]
*  He eats dirty bagels off the floor. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=477.7s)]
*  That's yes, that's what they do at Fox and that's what they're talking about. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=479.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=483.3s)]
*  I could think about some other important things that we should be talking about today, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=483.5s)]
*  but that's the weird dystopian world that Fox creates. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=487.5s)]
*  It's all a game to them and a gross game at it as well. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=490.8s)]
*  Here, Donald Trump was part of this Fox interview talks about I watch people in the capital. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=495.2s)]
*  Our people don't carry ropes on there. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=501.4s)]
*  I didn't even know what the hell he's talking about. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=503.3s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=504.6s)]
*  It's amazing when they don't give you the information when you know when they don't, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=505.70000000000005s)]
*  you know, they're not on the right that by bombers, not a person on the right. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=509.3s)]
*  It's a person on the left. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=512.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=513.6s)]
*  And you know, when I watch some of those people in the capital, our people don't carry ropes [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=514.6s)]
*  on their side and you know, this and that. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=520.0s)]
*  Our people aren't scaling. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=521.8000000000001s)]
*  Are you going to get to the bottom of it? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=523.7s)]
*  People? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=524.9s)]
*  Well, we're going to try. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=525.2s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to try. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=526.2s)]
*  And there's hey, look, the unselect committee of political thugs is horrible people, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=527.9s)]
*  Democrats and two of the worst Republicans in history crying Adam and Liz Cheney, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=533.8s)]
*  two of the worst. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=540.3s)]
*  They are just sick people. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=541.1999999999999s)]
*  Then Fox brings on Sean Duffy, the Secretary of Transportation who got his start on the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=543.0999999999999s)]
*  real world road rules challenge and here he attacks air traffic controllers for retiring [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=549.5s)]
*  after 25 years. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=557.0999999999999s)]
*  He goes, why do they retire so early? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=558.5s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=560.1999999999999s)]
*  We have too many controllers that retire after 25 years of service. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=561.5s)]
*  And so we have to look and go, is this a national security issue? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=565.6999999999999s)]
*  Is this a safety issue? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=568.5s)]
*  And should these air traffic controllers be retiring after 25 years of service? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=569.9s)]
*  Should we have another calculation that happens because of the of the national security [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=575.0999999999999s)]
*  component of our airspace? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=579.1999999999999s)]
*  That's something that we're looking at with with the administration because again, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=580.5999999999999s)]
*  and the only way you actually can build these numbers if you add 2000 people into the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=584.4s)]
*  system and you don't have 2000 people who lead the system, that's the only way the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=588.3s)]
*  numbers work. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=592.0s)]
*  So it's going to be a broader conversation, but we're going to focus on it. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=592.4s)]
*  And again, air travel is the safest mode of transportation in the country. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=595.9s)]
*  You can't travel anywhere safer than on an airplane. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=599.5999999999999s)]
*  A lot of news coverage about crashes now. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=602.1999999999999s)]
*  But again, we're working our hearts out to make sure everything is safe more air traffic [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=604.9s)]
*  controllers and we have a better air traffic control system, new investments. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=610.0999999999999s)]
*  And again, it's going to take a time to undo what wasn't done over the last four years [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=613.8s)]
*  to work. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=618.5s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=618.9s)]
*  Because it's a pretty stressful job. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=619.8s)]
*  What is their attack? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=621.4s)]
*  These rich people would hate Americans retiring. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=622.8s)]
*  They hate American Social Security. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=626.9s)]
*  They hate people. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=628.9s)]
*  They hate life. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  Life isn't all about me. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=632.0s)]
*  These air traffic controllers who work 25 years in a very stressful job. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=633.9s)]
*  You don't think they should retire after 25 years while these billionaires are getting [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=637.9s)]
*  all the benefits in the world. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=642.9s)]
*  It's so f'ed up. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=644.1s)]
*  Anyway, here you have Sean Duffy on pulling EV charging stations. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=645.6s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=651.9s)]
*  Not only that, they put charging stations into this project store. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=652.6999999999999s)]
*  We pulled those charging stations out and what we've done across are the grants that we give. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=656.1s)]
*  I'm not doing green. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm not doing social justice. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=662.6999999999999s)]
*  We're building infrastructure. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=664.5s)]
*  The last administration wanted all these green and social justice requirements that drive [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=666.3s)]
*  up the cost of projects. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=670.6999999999999s)]
*  We've said no more. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=672.0s)]
*  We're doing roads, bridges, this infrastructure at the southern border, but enough of the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=673.1s)]
*  side projects. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=678.3s)]
*  Make the investments. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=679.6s)]
*  Spend the taxpayer money well. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=681.0s)]
*  Enough of the green. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=682.4s)]
*  Enough of the social justice. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=683.6999999999999s)]
*  And so I think we're going to get more for the taxpayer money because we're focused the [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=685.0s)]
*  cash on infrastructure, not on social policy or Democrat liberal policy. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=689.1999999999999s)]
*  Show you this other piece right here where in the Fox interview with Pam Bondi, this [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=693.3s)]
*  is why they're state regime media because they're inextricably intertwined with the [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=698.9s)]

*  There's news here in New York that deals with Letitia James tried to prosecute the now [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=726.2s)]

*  All right. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=748.7s)]
*  Her office responded by saying the AG James is focused every single day in protecting [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=750.4s)]
*  New Yorkers. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=754.0s)]

*  into the weeds of the details. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=770.3s)]
*  This stems from a case in 1983 and the year 2000. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=772.2s)]
*  That's a minimum of 25 years. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=776.6s)]

*  Am I right about that? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=781.9s)]
*  Yeah, Bill the most I know about the case. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=782.7s)]

*  We have not seen it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=793.5s)]
*  I inquired right before I walked out here and no one in my office has read it yet. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=794.7s)]
*  We haven't looked at it. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=798.4000000000001s)]
*  Of course, we'll be reviewing it. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=799.7s)]
*  You just told me more than I've heard about it so far. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=801.4000000000001s)]

*  All right attorney. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=807.3000000000001s)]
*  And then the kind of capstone the the the gem if you will being sarcastic they bring [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=808.5s)]
*  in disgraced former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy and sometimes you forget what a [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=815.6999999999999s)]
*  pathetic spineless piece of you know, what this guy is. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=820.8s)]
*  So he goes on and he has the audacity and law on Laura Ingram because this is what they [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  were pushing the reason the economy is doing bad is because the Federal Reserve Chairman [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=830.4s)]
*  Jerome Powell saying bad things about the economy. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=837.3s)]
*  It's the federal chair's fault. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=840.5s)]
*  It's Federal Reserve Chair Powell. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=842.6999999999999s)]
*  He's doing it by talking about things play this clip. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=844.8s)]
*  Kevin I want to talk about what Jerome Powell did today. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=849.0999999999999s)]
*  He essentially came out and said that these tariffs which the Democrats are going to seize [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=853.3s)]
*  on obviously that the tariffs are going to you know, likely to create some type of recession [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=859.0999999999999s)]
*  and that will hurt us growth forecast going forward, which I mean there's a there's a [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=866.0s)]
*  obviously the Trump administration thinks the exact opposite about how these tariffs [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=871.9s)]
*  will work. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=876.0s)]
*  But of course that sent the market way down and you can kind of see this little game [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=877.5s)]
*  playing out between Powell and the Trump administration. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=882.1999999999999s)]
*  Do you think the Trump administration needs to come out in a full-throated manner and [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=886.0s)]
*  refute what the Fed chair said today about an issue that is still number one on the [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=890.5999999999999s)]
*  minds of all voters now and will be on the midterms? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=895.6s)]
*  Well, what he said is hurting the economy. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=899.2s)]
*  The market reacts to what he said. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=901.3000000000001s)]
*  Now he only has a short amount of time left in this job. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EDLUoDMg0&t=902.8000000000001s)]
