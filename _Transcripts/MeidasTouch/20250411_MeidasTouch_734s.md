# Trump gets RUDE AWAKENING from PISSED OFF Philadelphia
**MeidasTouch:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54)
*  Wow. A lot of emotion. There's a lot of emotion in this room. Thank you. Thank you. So the really [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=0.0s)]
*  nice thing is we have lines and I want to thank Chase and I want to thank Alan. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=10.96s)]
*  So that was in Philadelphia during the campaign in 2024. People in Philadelphia, I think, knew [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=15.68s)]
*  what Donald Trump was doing there. During the campaign, he was selling those ridiculous Trump [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=22.64s)]
*  gold sneakers. I don't even know what those are. But now Donald Trump is doing the selling of gold [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=28.4s)]
*  sneakers, but he's doing that with tariffing the world and then saying, I'm not going to pause the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=34.64s)]
*  tariffs ever. And then all of a sudden in the morning, he's like, now is a great time to buy, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=40.64s)]
*  buy, buy, buy, buy, buy. Then after saying that he's never going to pause the tariffs, he then [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=45.76s)]
*  announces that he's going to pause the tariffs. And then before that, all of a sudden you see [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=52.16s)]
*  lots of people trading on basically the S&P index that kind of tracks the S&P index. So all of these [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=57.76s)]
*  people are making like a ton of money buying when the markets are low. The whole thing feels [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=65.36s)]
*  exactly why we have a Securities and Exchange Commission and why we have systems of law and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=71.2s)]
*  order. So these things don't take place. But what happens when the federal level, you have the people [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=76.56s)]
*  who are tasked with enforcing the law and following it, seemingly breaking it every day. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=82.96s)]
*  Let's bring in Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner. Hey, Larry, you saw that first clip. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  Billy was booing him at least during the campaign. So your city knew what was up. So maybe comment [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=92.96s)]
*  on that first, but just the lawlessness that you're seeing, you're always someone who stood [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=98.72s)]
*  up to Donald Trump. But right now, how would you describe what's going on? I mean, it's a mess, yo. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=103.52s)]
*  What's going on is you have a bunch of people who basically are trying to rob the train. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=112.32s)]
*  And their job is supposed to be to make sure it's safe. That's really what's going on. We [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=119.28s)]
*  have a situation in which they are at war with equality, fundamentally. Fundamentally, that's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=124.64s)]
*  what it's about. Because there is no other way to be a monarch. There is no other way to be a dictator [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=129.76s)]
*  unless you are at war with equality. And they're willing to smash any institution, break any law to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=135.2s)]
*  destroy the judiciary, etc, etc. But your viewers already know that. Now, I do want to say this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=141.12s)]
*  You just talked about sneakers. I got a shirt for you. How about that one? So in Philly, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=150.24s)]
*  we use this phrase a lot, f around and find out. And that was basically Trump coming to Philadelphia [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  and finding out, you know, this is a city that has an attitude, we got a chip on our shoulder. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=165.12s)]
*  We are 40% white, 40% black, 20% other people of color. We're the poorest of the 10 largest cities. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=170.24s)]
*  And if you're going to come here and f around, you're going to find out one of the things that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  Trump has to worry about in the case of reform prosecutors like me, at least if we're not chicken, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=180.72s)]
*  is that he cannot pardon the people we convict. So for example, if I should convict Bannon, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=186.88s)]
*  Bannon is going to have to actually do that time and not get out of it because there is no [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  presidential power to pardon state court convictions. Thus, he can't pardon himself [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=198.4s)]
*  for being convicted of 34 felonies in state court in New York by state court prosecutor Alvin Bragg. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  Let's talk about what happened in the Oval Office yesterday, where he signs these executive orders. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  I want to ask you about the ones he's signing about the law firms and as, you know, a member [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=219.76s)]
*  of the bar. Why don't we start with that one? I'll get your take on that right now. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=224.96s)]
*  Trump signing these executive orders going after law firms. What's your take on these law firms, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  the, you know, some of these big firms capitulating, though, you know, you see them [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=235.44s)]
*  in Philly, the big names on the building, so and so and so and so that have these histories of being [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  of standing up for democracy. And now they're doing deals with Donald Trump to provide pro bono [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=246.96s)]
*  service to effectuate his authoritarian agenda. I mean, it's real simple. We should boycott them. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=253.2s)]
*  They're rotten. You know, we are all going to be judged by history and there's going to be a line. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=260.24s)]
*  And any university that is on the other side of that line, any law firm on the other side of that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=264.64s)]
*  line, any politician on the other side of that line deserves to get what the people who betrayed [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=269.44s)]
*  us during the Red Scare got. They deserve to go down in infamy. They deserve to lose whatever [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=275.52s)]
*  financial benefit they're getting from all of this. You know, sadly, history is not always [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=282.8s)]
*  going to do the right thing when you start actually looking into the history of a company like, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=287.76s)]
*  you know, Mercedes Benz or Volkswagen or something like that. There's some pretty ugly stuff there. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=292.16s)]
*  But for me, it's real simple. You know, if you're a law firm, you're going to be a scumbag. Why did [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=297.92s)]
*  you become a law firm in the first place? Go out of business or I'll help you. And I feel exactly [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=302.88s)]
*  the same way about politicians who capitulate or profiles and cowardice. The whole bunch of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=307.84s)]
*  them are bums and the whole bunch of them deserve a consequence. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  Larry, you're running for your third term as district attorney in Philadelphia. One of the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  statements that you made when you announced running for the third term is that you want [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=324.64s)]
*  this election to make a statement. You want this to be a sign of what's going to happen [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=330.48s)]
*  more broadly in the midterms. What do you mean by that? And what are you seeing across, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  you know, perhaps, you know, like Pennsylvania as a whole, not Philly, but Pennsylvania as a whole, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=342.8s)]
*  when, you know, when Trump, but, you know, he's attacking people's Medicaid and attacking farmers [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  and attacking people. What do you see in as a whole? What do you mean by you want to send that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=352.24s)]
*  message? Well, look, the country, this country may well fail if we don't win the midterms. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=355.92s)]
*  Seriously, it may well fail if we don't, if we as Democrats don't take back at least the house and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  hopefully a chunk of the Senate, then he is lining it all up for a military coup and to be a permanent [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=367.2s)]
*  quote, president unquote. So we got to win the midterms. Philadelphia is only the most important [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  city in the most important swing state. And while this is traditionally a low turnout election, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=378.56s)]
*  the reality is we've seen very high turnouts. The last two times that my campaign was in play, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=386.16s)]
*  it's partly because we talk about criminal justice and that's an issue that affects a lot of people [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=393.2s)]
*  who don't always vote in the same way. Post-Dobbs, you saw a lot of women who wouldn't otherwise have [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=397.6s)]
*  voted voting in Philly. What we have seen with our pretty awful history of prosecution and policing, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=403.36s)]
*  at least under Frank Rizzo in the city, what we have seen is that when criminal justice is on the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=412.0s)]
*  ballot, a whole lot of people who don't usually vote vote. So yes, I'd like another term, but [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=417.03999999999996s)]
*  what is really more important for the country is that we get a massive registration and a massive [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  turnout in Philadelphia and that this city is primed and this state therefore, because Philly [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=427.84s)]
*  and Pittsburgh do control who wins the state, are primed. So when the midterms come, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=433.44s)]
*  we can shake things up and we can put some brakes on this presidency. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=439.91999999999996s)]
*  It's incredibly important. What are you seeing on the ground right now? Are you seeing shifts? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=444.64s)]
*  And I mean, we've seen big protests that are growing and growing. Are you seeing shifts? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=450.32s)]
*  How would you characterize them? Well, let me tell you the good and the bad about the protest. The [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=454.56s)]
*  good is we saw this massive turnout all over the country. The bad is that I attended the protest [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=458.0s)]
*  and it was not fully reflective of the population. I attended the protest and there were a lot of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=463.44s)]
*  wonderful idealistic people there, but it was not very diverse in terms of age, in terms of race. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=470.4s)]
*  It seemed to reflect quite a number of people who were retired and overwhelmingly white population. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=476.64s)]
*  That's great as a start, but we got to do better. We are going to have to bring in people who are [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=483.36s)]
*  exciting other groups, who are exciting the future of the Democratic Party. And the future [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=488.64s)]
*  of the Democratic Party is young people. It's people who like AOC. It's people who like Bernie. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=493.28s)]
*  It's people who call themselves progressives. They need to be embraced rather than rejected. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  And when I went to this event and I'm hearing some nice enough but not exciting person [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=502.88s)]
*  talk about clean water and then someone's doing a pretty lousy version of a 1960s folks song, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=508.56s)]
*  we're part way there, but we need to go the rest of the way there. If the Democratic Party can [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=513.6s)]
*  include some of the constituencies or the potential voters that they are losing, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=518.88s)]
*  can animate them to believe in government enough to come to vote, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=523.9200000000001s)]
*  this is an easy win all across the country, but we do have to do that. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=527.52s)]
*  Larry, you've gone up against Trump over and over again. You've been fearless in what you've [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=532.0s)]
*  seen. You've never held back. No one will ever accuse you of mincing your words and what you've [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=537.2s)]
*  said about Trump. What do you say to people right now though who are seeing big firms capitulate, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  who are seeing media companies kiss the ring, who are seeing all of that? And people are scared. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=548.32s)]
*  They're scared they're living in an authoritarian regime. The chaos of what's going to happen [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=555.12s)]
*  tomorrow. What's your message, not just to the people in Philly, but we have a huge audience [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=559.84s)]
*  here, a huge international audience. What do you say to people right now in this moment? What [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=565.7600000000001s)]
*  should they do? Not be chickens. I mean, come on. World War II happened. My dad volunteered [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=570.72s)]
*  and served in World War II. A whole lot of people did. A lot of 19 year olds died in World War II. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=577.92s)]
*  What is your problem? Say something, do something, get up, vote. Stop acting like it's over when you [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=583.76s)]
*  haven't even tried. I mean, frankly, I think there need to be consequences for people who [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=590.16s)]
*  capitulate. If they're in elected office, vote them out. If it is the law firm you use, get a new one. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=596.16s)]
*  If you're going to a university that has a crazy endowment and takes advantage of its [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yt5jO-r54&t=602.64s)]
