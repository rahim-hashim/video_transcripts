*  Trump is going to get to keep it after he leaves the presidency because they're saying it's also going to be a gift for [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=30.52s)]
*  his presidential library his hypothetical library [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=38.0s)]
*  Which basically means the plane becomes his and his family's this is the most blatant corruption in plane view [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=42.28s)]
*  Add to that the fact that the Attorney General [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=50.32s)]
*  General Pam Bondi was previously a [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=53.28s)]

*  $115,000 per month add to that the fact that Qatar was the group or the country as part of a group that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=61.28s)]
*  bailed out Kushner when his building [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=68.84s)]
*  666 building interesting numbers in Manhattan was about to go bankrupt during the first Trump administration [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=72.0s)]
*  And by the way, do you hear Donald Trump talking bad about any Middle East countries? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=78.68s)]
*  We know Trump is talking crap about Canada about our allies in Europe [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=84.16000000000001s)]
*  But when it comes to Saudi Arabia when it comes to Qatar when it comes to the United Arab Emirates [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=89.72s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't have a negative thing to say about them [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  Add to that the fact that Donald Trump will be taking a trip to the Middle East [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  Meeting with all of these countries whose sovereign wealth funds are directly invested in [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=103.61999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump and Trump's family businesses add to that the fact that Trump's kids [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=109.74s)]
*  Recently held a conference with all of these Middle East sovereign wealth funds where they told the funds how you do business with [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=115.14s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago they called it the Mar-a-Lago [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=122.86s)]
*  Economy how foreign sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East can inject money directly into the Trump family [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=125.58s)]
*  Kids you not they held an actual conference that that dealt with that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=132.1s)]
*  Let me just read for you what Laura Loomer one of Trump's top advisors is saying about Trump doing this deal [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=136.96s)]
*  Then let's go through the facts and let's unpack this so fact number one [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=143.22s)]
*  Undisputed Trump is accepting this gift from cutter 400 million dollars gold plate and airplane [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=148.22s)]
*  So while Americans can't afford homes as prices are going up as Donald Trump manipulates the markets with on and off again trade wars [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=153.54s)]
*  This is what Trump is making deals for himself Laura Loomer says [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=161.1s)]
*  So not only will the president of the United States be flying around on a 400 million dollar jet paid for by cutter [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=165.18s)]
*  But don't forget our own United States Attorney General Pam Blondie [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=171.74s)]
*  That's what she calls her was once a registered foreign lobbyist on behalf of cutter Blondie was compensated [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=175.98s)]
*  $115,000 per month by cutter cutter has given over 1.8 billion dollars to Hamas over the years [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=183.22s)]
*  That's an incredible amount of influence for cutter a country that harbors Islamic terrorists who have with our most senior officials [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  Especially given the fact that Islam is completely incompatible with Western civilization and the Judeo-Christian values in our Constitution [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=195.66s)]
*  That's again what Trump's top advisor was reading you what she's saying. She then goes I love Trump [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=203.14s)]
*  I would take a bullet for him, but I have to call I don't like this expression a spade a spade [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=208.38s)]
*  But that's what she says. I'm just reading but I don't like that expression if you know its roots [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  She well, I don't like a lot of things that she says, let's be very clear most of the things she says [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=215.94000000000003s)]
*  But here she's always calling Trump out [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=219.82000000000002s)]
*  We cannot accept a 400 million dollar gift from jihadists in suits the Qataris from the same Iranian [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=221.54000000000002s)]
*  Proxies in Hamas and Hezbollah who have murdered us service members the same proxies that have worked with the Mexican cartels [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=228.78s)]
*  To get jihadists across our borders [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=235.58s)]
*  This is really going to be such a stain on the administration if it's true [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=237.86s)]
*  And I say that as someone who would take a bullet for Trump I am so [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=241.82s)]
*  Disappointed pull up right here the consultant agreement Pam Bondi or as Laura Loomer calls her Pam [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=245.92s)]
*  Blondie is indeed a foreign agent or was a foreign agent doing consulting services for Qatar here [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=252.78s)]
*  You see the agreement consulting services agreement [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=259.44s)]
*  Embassy of the United States you take a look here and you look at who is [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=262.86s)]
*  Involved in consideration of the mutual promises set forth herein the term of the agreement shall commence on July 1 and expire [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=267.94s)]
*  Appendix a additionally consultant shall provide services the following consultant personnel shall be designated key personnel [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=275.7s)]
*  Miss Pam Bondi and mr. James Rubin key personnel shall be personally and substantially engaged in the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=283.5s)]
*  delivery of the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=291.29999999999995s)]
*  Services so that I think is to comply with the Foreign Agent Services Act [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=293.1s)]
*  So Bondi was indeed a agent a consultant for Qatar as Ned Price says just take a look what happened in the past few days [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=299.18s)]
*  Trump is [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=306.18s)]
*  Negotiating truce deals directly with the Houthis covering only the United States Trump is speaking directly with Hamas [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=307.54s)]
*  declining to add Israel to his Middle East swing met face-to-face with Iranian officials [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=314.62s)]
*  Accepted a 400 million dollar plane from Qatar for personal use and Ned Price goes some of this has potential to be good [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=320.32s)]
*  I guess some is quite bad some is hideously ugly [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  But critics at home including in Congress and around the world would be howling from rooftops [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=329.2s)]
*  Had just about any other president done any of this? How about a fraction of this instead? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  We have a collective shrug. Well, you don't have a collective shrug here at the minus touch network [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=339.68s)]

*  Typical children's vitamins are basically candy in disguise [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=357.04s)]

*  Jared Kushner cutter and 666 Fifth Avenue y'all remember that story [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=508.6s)]
*  I'll just remind you of it right now. This was published March 11th, 2020. It goes on to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=514.2s)]
*  Talk about this timeline right here when the Kushner companies purchased 666 Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan in early [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=521.16s)]
*  2007 for a record-breaking [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=529.44s)]
*  1.8 billion dollars it was supposed to be the center of their real estate portfolio [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=531.6s)]
*  Instead the Kushner struggled to cover their debt on the troubled building [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=536.24s)]
*  since shortly after its purchase on the eve of the financial crisis as [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=540.48s)]
*  Jared Kushner's father-in-law Donald Trump was running for president at the time [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=544.8s)]
*  The Kushner's were pitching Qatari investors to help bail out the building and just weeks after his father Charles [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=549.0s)]
*  Reportedly failed to reach a deal with cutters Minister of Finance [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=555.88s)]
*  Jared Kushner in his capacity as a senior advisor to Donald Trump [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=560.32s)]
*  reportedly played a central role in supporting a blockade of cutter by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=565.76s)]
*  Kushner never disclosed his meeting with Saudi Arabia in the UAE on the blockade to then Secretary of State [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=574.24s)]
*  Rex Tillerson at the time later a financial company tied to cutter [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=580.2s)]
*  Brokered an especially valuable deal to rescue the Kushner companies property at [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=584.64s)]
*  666 Fifth Avenue, so that's the timeline there. So there are deep roots here. I want to also share with you some of these comments from [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  People who are reviewing the story at the New York Post [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=600.36s)]
*  I mean the New York Post is a right-wing paper [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=604.52s)]
*  So the commenters usually on New York Post stories are Trump and MAGA or Trump and MAGA adjacent [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=606.96s)]
*  I looked at the story that they published on on this where they talked about the gold-plated walls and you get things like this [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZmyz3fa1k&t=613.24s)]
