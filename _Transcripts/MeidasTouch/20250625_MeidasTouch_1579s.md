# Trump holds DISASTER PRESSER at NATO in FRONT OF WORLD
**MeidasTouch:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI)
*  Donald Trump just held a disastrous press conference at the NATO summit at the Hague in the Netherlands. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=0.0s)]
*  He was blowing up at reporters based on the latest intelligence from the Pentagon and CENTCOM that was leaked to the press, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=7.0s)]
*  showing that the attacks on the Iranian nuclear facilities were not all that successful. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=16.84s)]
*  Donald Trump has also been trying to cite Israeli intelligence, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=23.16s)]
*  and he's been putting out statements on behalf of Israel's intelligence, saying, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=27.76s)]
*  you see, Israel claims that we knocked out the Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=32.6s)]
*  But what Donald Trump was doing here at this disastrous press conference is he was trying to attack the reporters and saying, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=37.04s)]
*  the reporters, by saying that the United States did not do a successful military strike on the Iranian nuclear facilities, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=45.0s)]
*  you are making our pilots feel bad and you're making them sad and you're really being offensive to the troops [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=54.28s)]
*  by reporting on the leaks that their strikes on the Iranian nuclear facilities were not successful. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=63.0s)]
*  So you must hate the troops. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=69.88s)]
*  That's what he and Pete Hegseth and Marco Rubio continued to reiterate during this disastrous press conference here. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=72.12s)]
*  Watch this as Trump says, you really should just be proud of those pilots [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=79.88s)]
*  and you should shut up and stop asking questions about whether or not the operation was successful. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=88.52s)]
*  You shouldn't have issued a report until they did, but we've gotten the information. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=89.52s)]
*  I think Pete said it better than you can say it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, you should be proud. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=95.48s)]
*  You, especially you, should be proud of those pilots and you shouldn't be trying to demean them. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=98.08s)]
*  Those pilots flew at great risk. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  Big chance that they'd never come back home and see their husbands or their wives. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=107.6s)]
*  Let me just tell you, you and NBC fake news, which is one of the worst, and CNN, New York Times are all bad. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=111.44s)]
*  They're sick. There's something wrong with them. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=119.2s)]
*  You know what? You should be praising those people instead of trying to find some. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=121.12s)]
*  By getting me, by trying to go and get me, you're hurting those people. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=124.88s)]
*  They were devastated. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=128.52s)]
*  And then next you'll see Donald Trump makes up a fake conversation with the fighter pilots. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=129.6s)]
*  And he says, I got this call from the fighter pilots and they were really sad. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=135.0s)]
*  And they said, why is the media reporting that our strikes were not successful? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=140.28s)]
*  And this has hurt their feelings. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=144.8s)]
*  You're hurting their feelings, media. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=146.24s)]
*  You're hurting the fighter pilots. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=148.32s)]
*  Yeah, do you think fighter pilots who fly B2s are calling up Donald and saying, Donald, I'm really sad right now? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=149.68s)]
*  What a clown show this is. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=157.0s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=158.88s)]
*  I got a call from Missouri, great state, and I won three times by a lot. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=160.08s)]
*  And I got a call that the pilots and the people on the plane were devastated because they were trying to minimize the attack. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=166.44s)]
*  And they all said it was hit. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  But oh, but we don't think it was really maybe hit that badly. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=175.84s)]
*  And they were devastated. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=179.56s)]
*  They put their lives on the line. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=181.0s)]
*  And then they have. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=182.6s)]
*  And I'm not referring to you, but real scum, real scum come out and write reports that are as negative as they could possibly be. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=184.24s)]
*  It should be the opposite. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=192.44s)]
*  You should make them heroes and heroines. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=194.16s)]
*  You should make them really people that they were so devastated when they heard this news. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=197.24s)]
*  And you know what they said? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  One of them, I spoke to one of them, said, sir, we hit the site. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=204.32s)]
*  It was perfect. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=208.72s)]
*  It was dead on because they don't understand fake news because they have a normal life, except they have to fly very big, very fast planes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=209.96s)]
*  But it's a shame. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=219.44s)]
*  You should be making them heroes. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=220.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=222.0s)]
*  Then Donald Trump talks about how he is proud and it is his honor to allow Iran to sell cheap oil to China. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=222.72s)]
*  And this is going to be a great deal for China and Iran. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=234.16s)]
*  What are we even talking about? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=237.28s)]
*  You're saying that the United States is not going to enter into a deal with Iran to denuclearize them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=239.12s)]
*  And now Iran and China get a great oil deal together. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=246.0s)]
*  Are you hearing this here? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=249.76s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=250.96s)]
*  Go ahead. Yeah. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=252.36s)]
*  Blue dress. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mr. President. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday, you said China can now continue to purchase oil from Iran. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  Are you giving up on your maximum pressure campaign? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  Because there's sanctions right now with who on Iran? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  No, look, they just had a war. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=268.64s)]
*  The war was fought. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=271.36s)]
*  They fought it bravely. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=272.48s)]
*  I'm not giving up. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=274.2s)]
*  They're in the oil business. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=275.44s)]
*  I mean, I could stop it if I wanted to sell China the oil myself. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=276.72s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=280.88s)]
*  They're going to need money to put that country back into shape. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  We want to see that happen. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=284.92s)]
*  Would it? No. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=287.12s)]
*  If they're going to sell oil, they're going to sell oil. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=288.44s)]
*  We're not taking over the oil. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  We could have, you know. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=291.56s)]
*  I used to say with Iraq, keep the oil. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=292.56s)]
*  I could say it here, too. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=294.32s)]
*  We could have kept the oil. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=295.32s)]
*  Now China is going to want to buy oil. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=297.52s)]
*  They can buy it from us. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=300.24s)]
*  They can buy it from other people. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=301.36s)]
*  But you're going to have to put that country back into shape. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=303.44s)]
*  It desperately needs money. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=305.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=307.92s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=309.36s)]
*  Because then a reporter asked Donald Trump, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=312.32s)]
*  that's odd what you're saying. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=314.08s)]
*  So are you interested in restarting negotiations with Iran [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=316.16s)]
*  for their denuclearization? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  Wasn't that kind of the point of this? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=323.32s)]
*  And Donald Trump goes, I'm not. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=325.6s)]
*  You know, the Iranians fought. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  They're brave. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=330.04s)]
*  I trust them. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=331.24s)]
*  Why would I want to do a deal with them? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=332.56s)]
*  Why would we talk about denuclearization? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=334.16s)]
*  The war is over. We're done. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  We're done here. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=338.0s)]
*  What? What? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  Are you interested in restarting negotiations with Iran? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=342.64s)]
*  And if so, have they res- [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=346.08s)]
*  So our people, like Marco could answer, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  but our people are not, I'm not. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=349.8s)]
*  The way I look at it, they fought. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=354.64s)]
*  The war's done. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, I could get a statement [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=358.04s)]
*  that they're not going to go nuclear. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=360.24s)]
*  We're probably going to ask for that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=361.44s)]
*  But they're not going to be doing it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=363.68s)]
*  But they're not going to be doing it anyway. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  They've had it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=367.24s)]
*  They've had it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=368.6s)]
*  Now, maybe someday in the future we'll want that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=369.56s)]
*  But I've asked Marco, do you want to draw a- [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=372.24s)]
*  I just asked him the question as we're walking on the stage. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=375.12s)]
*  You want to draw up a little agreement for them to sign? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=377.76s)]
*  Because I think we can get them to sign it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=379.92s)]
*  I don't think it's necessary. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=382.96s)]
*  Marco, do you want to talk- [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  Then Donald Trump is asked, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=385.24s)]
*  is there any indication from U.S. intelligence [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=386.56s)]
*  that Iran was able to move any of the nuclear material [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=389.64s)]
*  out of the facilities? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=393.32s)]
*  Here, watch his response. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=394.56s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=396.32s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=397.32s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=399.64s)]
*  You've made clear your position on what impact the strikes had. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=400.52s)]
*  I wanted to ask you what is next with Iran. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=403.96s)]
*  For instance, is there any indication from U.S. intelligence [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=406.84s)]
*  that Iran was able to move any material- [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=410.2s)]
*  No, just the opposite. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=413.12s)]
*  We think we hit them so hard and so fast, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=414.84000000000003s)]
*  they didn't get to move. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=416.92s)]
*  And if you knew about that material, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=418.12s)]
*  it's very hard and very dangerous to move. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=419.32s)]
*  It's called, in many people, they call it dust. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=422.44s)]
*  But it's very, very heavy. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=426.36s)]
*  It's very, very hard to move. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=427.76s)]
*  And they were way down. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=429.96s)]
*  They're 30 stories down. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=431.40000000000003s)]
*  They're literally 30, 35 stories down underground. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=433.56s)]
*  Oh yeah, we think we got- [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=437.36s)]
*  We think it's covered with granite, concrete, and steel. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=438.6s)]
*  Can I ask you, are you interested in restarting- [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  Did you notice how he said, we think? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=446.8s)]
*  We think right there. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=449.12s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what the Pentagon's damage assessment says [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=451.44s)]
*  and what separately CENTCOM's damage assessment says. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=455.96s)]
*  And it says that these facilities were hit, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=460.64s)]
*  they were damaged, but they were certainly not destroyed, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=462.76s)]
*  and that Iran will be able to restart any nuclear ambitions [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=466.23999999999995s)]
*  in the next few months. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=470.47999999999996s)]
*  That's our own damage assessment. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=471.52s)]
*  Now also, Donald Trump canceled a bipartisan briefing [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=474.2s)]
*  in Congress between the Trump regime officials [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=479.08s)]
*  and the House and the Senate, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  where they would share that intelligence. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=484.2s)]
*  But the Trump regime blocked that indefinitely. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=485.96s)]
*  Why would they block that indefinitely? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=488.92s)]
*  Because they're covering up [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=490.88s)]
*  that it was not a successful operation. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=492.24s)]
*  Next, a reporter asked Donald Trump, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  you promised that there would be peace in Ukraine [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=498.52s)]
*  in 24 hours, so was that sarcastic? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=501.0s)]
*  And you'll hear Donald Trump goes, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  of course that was sarcastic, of course it was. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  He goes, yeah, it was just harder to deal with Putin [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=510.08s)]
*  and harder to deal with Zelensky. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=513.32s)]
*  He has to both sides it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=515.08s)]
*  Then I thought, and then Donald Trump goes, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  but look at what I've done. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  I've made peace in the Middle East. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=520.2800000000001s)]
*  We ended a war in Iran, 30 years of war I just ended. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=522.36s)]
*  No, you didn't, what are you talking about? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=526.0400000000001s)]
*  Then he says, I stopped the war in Rwanda. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=528.36s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=531.48s)]
*  Then he goes and says, I should get credit [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=532.72s)]
*  for ending the wars in Serbia. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  The hell? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=537.0s)]
*  Then he goes, I should get credit, remember this one, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=537.96s)]
*  for the India and Pakistan ceasefire. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=541.0400000000001s)]
*  He goes, I dangled trade in front of India and Pakistan. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=543.8000000000001s)]
*  They were gonna go to nuclear war with each other [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=546.84s)]
*  and they stopped going to nuclear war because of me. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=549.4000000000001s)]
*  I did it, I stopped the Pakistan-India nuclear war. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=552.64s)]
*  And I'm sure you've seen all of my Midas Touch broadcasts [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=558.2s)]
*  where I've shown the India foreign minister [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=561.88s)]
*  and the India's prime minister Modi saying, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=564.64s)]
*  Trump had nothing to do with this at all. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=567.2s)]
*  It was a bilateral discussion between India and Pakistan. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=570.32s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't dangle trade in front of us. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=573.6400000000001s)]
*  There's not even a trade deal right now [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=576.1600000000001s)]
*  between the United States and India. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=577.88s)]
*  Donald Trump just goes there on the international stage. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=579.88s)]
*  He makes a fool of the United States. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=582.6400000000001s)]
*  So no wonder we see Canada and the EU [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=584.7600000000001s)]
*  entering into their own defense agreements [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=588.36s)]
*  and why this whole NATO summit, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=590.84s)]
*  Donald Trump may think he looks strong and tough, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=593.6s)]
*  but it was all of the nations [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=597.2s)]
*  just kind of keeping the United States at the side [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=598.76s)]
*  while the other NATO nations figure out [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=601.76s)]
*  their new arrangements without the US. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=603.76s)]
*  But here's Donald Trump taking credit [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=605.64s)]
*  for stopping every war in the past 50 years. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=608.24s)]
*  Listen to him, it's insane, play this clip. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=612.8s)]
*  Mr. President, Johannes Patera [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=618.16s)]
*  from Austrian National Television. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=619.64s)]
*  How are you? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=621.56s)]
*  You once said that you would end the Ukraine war in 24 hours. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=622.4s)]
*  You later said, you said that sarcastically. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=626.04s)]
*  Of course it was sarcastic. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=629.48s)]
*  But you've now been in office for five months and five days. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  Why have you not been able to end the Ukraine war? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=633.8s)]
*  Because it's more difficult [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=636.96s)]
*  than people would have any idea. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=638.64s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has been more difficult. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=642.16s)]
*  Frankly, I had some problems with Zelensky. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=644.48s)]
*  You may have read about him [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=646.84s)]
*  and it's been more difficult than other wars. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=648.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, we just ended a war in 12 days [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=650.92s)]
*  that was simmering for 30 years, frankly. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=653.12s)]
*  We ended Rwanda and the Congo. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=656.76s)]
*  It's coming to sign the documents. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=660.28s)]
*  We've already signed basic documents, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=662.04s)]
*  but they're coming, I think, to the White House on Friday. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=663.8s)]
*  We ended, Serbia was gonna go at it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=667.88s)]
*  But maybe the most important of all, India and Pakistan. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=671.3199999999999s)]
*  And that wasn't whether or not they may someday have nukes [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=676.68s)]
*  like we're talking about in the Middle East, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=680.16s)]
*  like we're talking about with Israel and Iran. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=683.0s)]
*  This is the half nuclear weapons. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=686.88s)]
*  I ended that with a series of phone calls on trade. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=689.32s)]
*  I said, look, if you're gonna go fighting each other, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=692.6s)]
*  it was getting very bad. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=696.36s)]
*  You know how bad that last attack was. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=697.72s)]
*  It was really bad. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=699.44s)]
*  If you're gonna go fighting each other, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=700.76s)]
*  we're not doing any trade deal. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=702.2s)]
*  No, no, no, you have to do a trade deal. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=703.4s)]
*  I said, we're not doing any trade deal. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=705.52s)]
*  And in fact, I had the general, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=707.96s)]
*  it was very impressive. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=709.7199999999999s)]
*  The general from Pakistan was in my office last week. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=713.0s)]
*  You know, Prime Minister Modi is a great friend of mine. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=718.92s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, he's a great man. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=721.56s)]
*  And I got them to reason. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=724.28s)]
*  I said, we're not doing a trade deal if you're gonna fight. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=725.4399999999999s)]
*  And if you're gonna fight each other, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=727.4799999999999s)]
*  we're not doing a trade deal. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=728.64s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=729.64s)]
*  He said, no, I wanna do the trade deal. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=730.88s)]
*  We stopped the nuclear war, go ahead. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=732.5999999999999s)]
*  Go ahead, go ahead. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=734.3599999999999s)]
*  Then Donald Trump continues to talk about, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=736.2s)]
*  and the language that he's using shows [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=738.96s)]
*  he has no clue what he's even saying, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=741.84s)]
*  how the United States was able [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=743.6400000000001s)]
*  to stop Iran's nuclear program. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=745.36s)]
*  But notice what Donald Trump says. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=747.88s)]
*  He goes, the Iranians knew we were coming. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=749.8000000000001s)]
*  So if they knew we were, this is his logic. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=752.76s)]
*  If they knew we were coming in advance, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=755.2800000000001s)]
*  why would they move the uranium out? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=758.0400000000001s)]

*  they would clearly keep the uranium in there [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=762.0400000000001s)]
*  and let us blow up the facilities. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=764.1600000000001s)]
*  That's what he says, play this clip. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=766.88s)]
*  You need to even get down. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=767.7199999999999s)]
*  The whole thing is collapsed in a disaster. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=768.56s)]
*  And I think all of the nuclear stuff is down there [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=770.9599999999999s)]
*  because it's very hard to remove. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=773.0799999999999s)]
*  And we did it very quickly. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=775.4s)]
*  When they heard we were coming, it was, you know, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=777.56s)]
*  you can't move it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=779.68s)]
*  It's very hard, very dangerous actually to move too. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=780.52s)]
*  And they also knew we were coming. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=783.64s)]

*  we want no nuclear, but we destroyed the nuclear. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=947.46s)]

*  I said, Iran will not have nuclear. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=952.38s)]
*  Well, we blew it up. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=955.82s)]
*  It's blown up. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=956.9s)]
*  The kingdom come, and so, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=958.9s)]
*  I don't feel very strongly about it. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=961.5600000000001s)]
*  If we got a document, it wouldn't be bad. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=962.98s)]
*  We're going to meet with them, actually. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=964.98s)]
*  We're going to meet with them. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=966.52s)]
*  Next, Donald Trump attacks [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=967.9s)]
*  the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=969.82s)]
*  Donald Trump basically says that he's an idiot. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=973.62s)]
*  So just Donald Trump, just think about this. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=976.5s)]
*  He's on the international stage. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=978.38s)]
*  He's speaking at a NATO summit, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=980.22s)]
*  and he's calling the chairman of the Federal Reserve [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=983.9000000000001s)]
*  in the United States an idiot. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=987.4000000000001s)]
*  Do you think that's helpful to having the United States [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=989.94s)]
*  be the world's reserve currency? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=992.58s)]
*  Do you think that brings stability [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=994.82s)]
*  to the United States at all? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=997.2600000000001s)]
*  Do you think that'll, I don't think so. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=998.86s)]
*  And then Donald Trump lies and says [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1001.3000000000001s)]
*  that he's already brought in $15 trillion [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1003.54s)]

*  The entire United States GDP is around 23 or $24 trillion. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1012.74s)]
*  Where have you brought in this $15 trillion from? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1018.82s)]
*  But Donald Trump's a fraud. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1022.7s)]
*  He's a criminal fraudster, right? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1024.58s)]
*  He was, he's a criminal. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1026.26s)]
*  He's a felon. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1028.66s)]

*  He was found civilly liable for fraud as well. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1031.14s)]
*  He's also a sexual abuser. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1034.0400000000002s)]
*  He was found liable for sexual abuse. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1035.5800000000002s)]
*  But in his civil cases and the criminal case, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1037.6200000000001s)]
*  he is that he makes things up, right? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1040.7s)]
*  In the civil case, he makes up fake valuations. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1042.74s)]
*  He says something's worth billions [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1045.42s)]
*  when it's worth millions. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1046.94s)]

*  It's not a real number, play this clip. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1051.0600000000002s)]

*  Hundreds of billions of dollars of tariff money [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1086.7s)]
*  is pouring in. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1088.94s)]
*  Factories are being built because they don't wanna- [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1090.02s)]
*  And as Donald Trump is saying that, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1092.02s)]
*  we also got word for the chairman of the Federal Reserve [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1093.5800000000002s)]
*  that most experts believe inflation [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1096.6200000000001s)]
*  is going to be significantly higher [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1098.98s)]
*  as we continue to go through the summer. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1101.7s)]
*  And you all know from going into stores and buying things [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1104.26s)]
*  and existing on planet Earth that prices are not down. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1108.46s)]
*  We know that. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1112.5800000000002s)]
*  So Donald Trump can continue to lie about everything, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1114.06s)]
*  but we know when we leave the house [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1117.1s)]
*  that he's absolutely lying. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1118.86s)]
*  Then Donald Trump attacks Spain [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1121.26s)]
*  because Spain doesn't want to increase [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1123.94s)]
*  their defense spending. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1126.1s)]
*  So he goes, I'm working on a trade deal with them. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1127.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm gonna make them pay twice as much, twice as much. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1130.3s)]
*  Okay, tough guy, what an idiot. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1133.72s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1135.3s)]
*  Okay, we'll do one or two more. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1136.4199999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1140.82s)]
*  A question on Spain. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1142.1399999999999s)]
*  Are you satisfied with today's- [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1143.5s)]
*  Oh, I think Spain's terrible what they've done. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1145.5s)]
*  No, I do. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1148.46s)]
*  They're the only country that won't pay the full up. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1149.3s)]
*  They wanna stay at 2%. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1152.18s)]
*  I think it's terrible. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1153.46s)]
*  And you know, they're doing very well. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1154.34s)]
*  The economy's very well. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1155.5s)]
*  And that economy could be blown right out of the water [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1157.56s)]
*  with something bad happening. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1159.94s)]
*  Spain is the only country that- [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1161.26s)]
*  Are you from Spain? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1162.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1163.82s)]
*  Good, congratulations. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1164.66s)]
*  You're the only country that is not paying. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1166.34s)]
*  I don't know what the problem is. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1168.74s)]
*  I think it's too bad. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1170.34s)]
*  So we'll make it up. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1171.82s)]
*  You know what we're gonna do? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1172.6599999999999s)]
*  We're negotiating with Spain on a trade deal. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1173.62s)]
*  We're gonna make them pay twice as much. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1176.26s)]
*  And I'm actually serious about that. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1177.98s)]
*  We're gonna make Spain- [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1179.5s)]
*  I like Spain. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1181.02s)]
*  I have so many people from Spain [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1181.86s)]
*  that it's a great place and they're great people. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1183.4199999999998s)]
*  But Spain is the only country out of all of the countries [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1186.98s)]
*  that refuses to pay. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1192.1799999999998s)]
*  And you know, so they want a little bit of a free ride, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1196.7s)]
*  but they'll have to pay it back to us on trade [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1200.1s)]
*  because I'm not gonna let that happen. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1201.9399999999998s)]
*  It's unfair. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1203.34s)]
*  It's unfair to them. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1204.1799999999998s)]
*  All right, sir, please. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1205.1s)]
*  Go ahead, right in the back. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1206.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you tall one. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1208.1399999999999s)]
*  The tall man. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1209.8999999999999s)]
*  Then Donald Trump waxes poetic [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1213.3799999999999s)]
*  about how the Defense Department [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1216.56s)]
*  should really be called the War Department. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1219.2199999999998s)]
*  And he goes, I'm gonna introduce Pete Hegseth to all of you, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1222.06s)]
*  the Secretary of War. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1225.1399999999999s)]
*  Let's call it the Secretary of War, he says. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1227.02s)]
*  I have, as you know, Marco Rubio with me [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1230.3s)]
*  and Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State and Secretary of War. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1232.82s)]
*  Should we say Secretary- [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1237.5s)]
*  You know, it used to be called Secretary of War. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1238.34s)]
*  Maybe for a couple of weeks we'll call it that [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1240.1399999999999s)]
*  because we feel like warriors. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1242.7s)]
*  Used to be called Secretary of War. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1244.3s)]
*  In fact, if you look at the old building [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1246.3s)]
*  next to the White House, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1248.3799999999999s)]
*  you can see where it used to be Secretary of War. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1249.34s)]
*  Then we became politically correct [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1251.34s)]
*  and they called it Secretary of Defense. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1253.54s)]
*  Maybe we'll have to start thinking about changing it, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1255.94s)]
*  but we feel that way. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1259.0600000000002s)]
*  Do we have any questions, please? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1261.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1263.66s)]
*  And then you have Pete Hegseth. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1264.5s)]
*  This is just a total embarrassment right here. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1265.5s)]
*  He goes to the media as though like, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1268.3400000000001s)]
*  he's like acting in some like corny, weird movie, right? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1270.1000000000001s)]
*  Like straight, we called it growing up, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1274.42s)]
*  straight to DVD type of movie. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1276.94s)]
*  He's like, if you, the media, wanna make an assessment [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1279.14s)]
*  of what happened at those nuclear facilities, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1282.46s)]
*  you better get a big shovel and start digging. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1285.02s)]
*  This is so stupid. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1290.98s)]
*  These are just dumb people. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1291.98s)]
*  What idiots here play this clip? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1293.6200000000001s)]
*  Meeting for a tactical reason with President Putin. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1295.78s)]
*  Let him answer this. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1298.6200000000001s)]
*  Hello, Mr. Secretary. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1299.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1300.82s)]
*  There's a reason the president calls out fake news [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1302.42s)]
*  for what it is. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1305.02s)]
*  These pilots, these refuelers, these fighters, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1306.6200000000001s)]
*  these air defenders, the skill and the courage it took [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1310.66s)]
*  to go into enemy territory flying 36 hours [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1313.46s)]
*  on behalf of the American people in the world [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1315.78s)]
*  to take out a nuclear program [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1317.78s)]
*  is beyond what anyone in this audience can fathom. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1319.74s)]
*  And then the instinct, the instinct of CNN, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1323.18s)]
*  the instinct of the New York Times [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1326.46s)]
*  is to try to find a way to spin it [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1328.5s)]
*  for their own political reasons [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1332.22s)]
*  to try to hurt President Trump or our country. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1333.82s)]
*  They don't care what the troops think. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1336.78s)]
*  They don't care what the world thinks. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1338.3400000000001s)]
*  They wanna spin it to try to make him look bad [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1339.98s)]
*  based on a leak. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1342.58s)]
*  Of course, we've all seen plenty of leakers [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1343.6999999999998s)]
*  and what do leakers do? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1345.74s)]
*  They have agendas. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1346.58s)]
*  And what do they do? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1347.58s)]
*  Do they share the whole information [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1348.4199999999998s)]
*  or just the part that they want to introduce? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1350.74s)]
*  And when they introduce that preliminary, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1353.1s)]
*  a preliminary report that's deemed to be a low assessment, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1355.86s)]
*  you know what a low assessment means? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1360.98s)]
*  Low confidence in the data in that report. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1362.5s)]
*  And why is there low confidence? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1365.26s)]
*  Because all of the evidence of what was just bombed [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1366.98s)]
*  by 12, 30,000 pound bombs is buried under a mountain, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1370.14s)]
*  devastated and obliterated. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1375.0600000000002s)]
*  So if you wanna make an assessment [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1376.8600000000001s)]
*  of what happened at Fordow, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1378.6200000000001s)]
*  you better get a big shovel and go really deep [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1380.14s)]
*  because Iran's nuclear program is obliterated. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1383.46s)]
*  And somebody somewhere is trying to leak something to say, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1386.5s)]
*  oh, with low confidence, we think maybe it's moderate. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1390.22s)]
*  Those that dropped the bombs precisely in the right place [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1393.8600000000001s)]
*  know exactly what happened when that exploded. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1397.58s)]
*  And you know who else knows? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1400.74s)]
*  Iran. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1401.86s)]
*  That's why they came to the table right away [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1402.78s)]
*  because their nuclear capabilities have been set back [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1404.46s)]
*  beyond what they thought were possible [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1408.4199999999998s)]
*  because of the courage of a commander in chief [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1410.46s)]
*  who led our troops despite what the fake news wants to say. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1412.9399999999998s)]
*  But you're not disputing the report. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1415.9399999999998s)]
*  So also we learned today that US Secretary of Defense [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1417.1s)]
*  Pete Hegsup has announced that the Pentagon [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1420.02s)]
*  along with the FBI is launching a criminal investigation [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1422.58s)]
*  into the leaks surrounding the classified report [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1426.5s)]
*  on the ineffectiveness of last weekend's US strikes [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1430.22s)]
*  against Iran that was completed [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1433.38s)]
*  by the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1435.5s)]
*  and based on a battle damage assessment done [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1438.78s)]
*  by the US Central Command CENTCOM. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1441.9s)]
*  And this information was leaked to CNN, Fox, NBC [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1444.98s)]
*  and the New York Times and others. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1447.94s)]
*  And again, it came from both CENTCOM and DIA. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1450.5s)]
*  So the fact that our own intelligence community saying [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1454.34s)]
*  that these strikes were not effective, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1457.4199999999998s)]
*  how is the Trump regime responding? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1459.3799999999999s)]
*  The White House this morning is sending to reporters [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1461.82s)]
*  a statement by the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1464.3799999999999s)]
*  that claims the US strike on Fordow destroyed [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1468.7s)]
*  the site's critical infrastructure [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1472.18s)]
*  and rendered the enrichment facility inoperable. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1474.3s)]
*  Even as Barack Rabid says, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1477.3799999999999s)]
*  this is a highly unusual case of the White House [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1479.1399999999999s)]
*  releasing a statement on behalf [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1481.78s)]
*  of a foreign security agency, the Israeli security agency. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1483.86s)]
*  This statement was not even distributed by Israel. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1487.78s)]
*  Trump's what, the spokesperson [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1492.86s)]
*  for the Israeli International Agency. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1495.5s)]
*  It's so ridiculous. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1498.1399999999999s)]

*  and go to MidasPlus.com. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1501.46s)]
*  Didn't Donald Trump once say [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1503.3799999999999s)]
*  that Iran oil sales finance terror and now he's allowing it? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1505.34s)]
*  Didn't Trump once warn that China's oil purchases [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1510.98s)]
*  made Iran rich and fueled terror? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1514.9399999999998s)]
*  Now he calls it a great honor. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1517.54s)]
*  You heard him there. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1519.34s)]
*  Do you remember when Donald Trump said [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1520.58s)]
*  that Russia was offering to mediate the Iran dispute? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1522.8999999999999s)]
*  If you were Russia and you were mediating [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1527.6999999999998s)]
*  the Iran situation, wouldn't you want the outcome [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1531.3s)]
*  to be exactly what the outcome is right now? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1535.1s)]
*  No deal over denuclearization with Iran. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1538.42s)]
*  They still have their nuclear weapons [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1540.98s)]
*  and now they sell cheap oil to China? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1542.8600000000001s)]
*  Sounds like a home run. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1545.42s)]
*  What are we even talking about here? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1547.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, there you have it, folks. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHU3aIf9klI&t=1549.2600000000002s)]
