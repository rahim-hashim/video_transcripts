# Trump Witnesses CLOBBERED on LIVE TV from CROSS-EXAM
**MeidasTouch:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko)
*  He had more guts and balls than you because he said I'm not going to send in the uniform military to do something that I know in my gut isn't right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=0.0s)]
*  That was Democratic Senator Slotkin cross-examining Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and telling him you don't have any balls. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=7.12s)]
*  You pathetic, vile human being. You Democrats were not holding back at all. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=15.92s)]
*  Let me show you that full exchange when Democratic Senator Slotkin looks at Hegseth and tells him that he does not have balls. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=21.84s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=29.6s)]
*  Giving that order to your predecessor, to a Republican Secretary of Defense who I give a lot of credit to because he didn't accept the order. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=30.4s)]
*  He had more guts and balls than you because he said I'm not going to send in the uniform military to do something that I know in my gut isn't right. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=38.4s)]
*  He was asked to shoot at their legs. He wrote that in his book. That's not hearsay. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=45.6s)]
*  Here was another part of that incredible cross-examination by Democratic Senator Slotkin. Let's play it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=50.0s)]
*  They can arrest all day long. That's the job. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=55.44s)]
*  Do they have the ability, the uniform military, to arrest and detain protesters currently today? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=57.76s)]
*  It's a yes or no thing. Authorities. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=66.24s)]
*  It's sort of amusing the extent to which the speculation is out there. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  These troops are given very clear orders. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=71.92s)]
*  Then what is the order? Then list it out for us. Be a man. List it out. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  Didn't you authorize them to detain or arrest? That is a fundamental issue of democracy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=78.32s)]
*  I'm not trying to be a snot here. I'm just trying to get the actual, did you authorize them to do that? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=83.52s)]
*  All of these orders and what they're sent there to do are public. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=88.96s)]
*  Say it. Say it. Yes or no? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=93.44s)]
*  I'd like to. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=96.16s)]
*  Please. Yes or no? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  As I've said time and time again through interruption, they're there to protect law enforcement. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=98.64s)]
*  Do they have the ability to arrest? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=103.6s)]
*  Who are trying to do their job deporting illegals who were allowed in by the previous administration. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=105.36s)]
*  They cannot arrest and detain citizens of the United States, the uniformed military. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=109.76s)]
*  As we've stated, if necessary in their own self-defense, they could temporarily detain and hand over to ICE. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=113.76s)]
*  But there's no arresting going on. You know this better than you're trying to play political games. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=120.64s)]
*  There's no arresting of US personnel. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=126.16s)]
*  Of the US military against members of the protest. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=128.4s)]
*  Have you authorized US military cyber tools to investigate people participating in these protests? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=132.24s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=138.8s)]
*  Certainly in no way that I'd be aware of. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=139.92s)]
*  Okay, that's good. I love that answer. That's great. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  Have you given? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  Next you have Democratic Senator Gerono and he or she's cross-examining Pete Hegseth. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=146.64s)]
*  And she asks, if ordered by the president to shoot peaceful protesters in the legs, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=152.56s)]
*  would you carry it out? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=158.56s)]
*  I think as Julia Davis says, can you just answer no? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=161.12s)]
*  But notice that Hegseth refuses to answer. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=164.88s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=167.04s)]
*  If ordered by the president, I'm going to ask you once again, to shoot peaceful protesters in the legs, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=168.16s)]
*  would you carry out such an order from the president? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=173.52s)]
*  Senator, as I've said before, of course, I reject the premise of your question. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=179.04s)]
*  And the characterization that I would be given or are given on lawful orders, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=184.0s)]
*  it's all meant to attempt to smear the commander in chief. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=188.64s)]
*  Considering that the president in his first term actually ordered such a thing, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=191.12s)]
*  it is not a premise that you can reject. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  He can order, do the same thing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  So you're again, I think you would just follow what the president wants you to do. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  Let's face it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=206.8s)]
*  Next up, you have Democratic Senator Tim Kaine. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=207.44000000000003s)]
*  Here he does cross-examining Pete Hegseth about changing the name of American military bases [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=211.28s)]
*  back to the names of Confederate traitors. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  And Senator Kaine has the family members, the descendants of some of the people [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=222.4s)]
*  who the bases are now named after, who are going to have their names removed [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  to bring back in the Confederate traitors. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=233.44s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=235.76s)]
*  Why did you decide that these four patriots were not worthy enough to have their names on a base? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=237.44s)]
*  Well, Senator, as you know, this was never about the names of the bases they were renamed to. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=244.72s)]
*  So you don't challenge all bases to their original names because we're not about erasing it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=249.52s)]
*  Okay, you wanted to, you don't care about their military record. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  You wanted to restore the Confederate names. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=259.52s)]
*  When you called the Gregg family to tell them that their dad's name was no longer going to be on the base, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=261.6s)]
*  what was their reaction? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  Senator, the Army notified them of that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=272.08s)]
*  You didn't call any of the families, and I've spoken with the families, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=274.24s)]
*  and the families were called by the press. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=277.84s)]
*  That's how they learned about this. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=280.48s)]
*  They learned about it from the press. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=282.56s)]
*  You didn't call the Barfit family, the Gregg family, and you didn't call the Adams family. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=283.92s)]
*  I told the families I'd ask you about this today. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=289.92s)]
*  In fact, two of General Gregg's granddaughters, Avery and Sydney, are right here in the audience, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=291.92s)]
*  and I want to ask you this as I close. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=296.08s)]
*  While you announced that these brave men and women's names would be stripped from the Virginia bases, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  no orders to that effect have been received by the base commanders. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  In light of the patriotic service of Van Barfit, Arthur Gregg, Charity Adams, and Mary Walker, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=309.2s)]
*  I'd like to ask you simply not to issue the orders changing the names of these Virginia bases. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=314.64s)]
*  These families, my Commonwealth, are very proud of these heroes, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=321.2s)]
*  very satisfied with these names, and ask you not to change them. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=325.12s)]
*  Will you honor these exemplary patriots and keep their worthy names in places on the bases they loved and where they served? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  Senator, we very much thank and appreciate them for their service, and we'll find ways to recognize them, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=338.8s)]
*  but the orders will soon be going to those bases to change the names back to the original name that never should have been changed. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=343.68s)]
*  But you have the power to not send those orders. They haven't gone out yet, correct? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=349.12s)]
*  Thank you, Jeff. Senator, your time has expired. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  Senator Craig. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=356.16s)]
*  Next up in this cross-examination of Hegseth by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=356.8s)]
*  Hegseth admits that the Trump regime will not be following orders of any court other than the Supreme Court, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=362.56s)]
*  thus they will not be following district court and court of appeals orders, if you listen to what he's saying. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=374.64s)]
*  How many troops can you deploy domestically before you start to cut into our readiness internationally? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=375.68s)]
*  As I said, previous administrations deployed our National Guard all around the globe in numbers far beyond what we were capable of supporting. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=384.16s)]
*  So limited contingencies inside the United States to protect federal law enforcement is doable. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=391.68s)]
*  If the Supreme Court orders you to remove troops from American city streets, will you do so? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=397.12s)]
*  Can you repeat the question, please? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=402.8s)]
*  Yes, if the Supreme Court orders you to remove troops from American cities, will you do so? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=404.24s)]
*  As I've said, Senator, I don't believe district courts should determine national security policy, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=410.0s)]
*  but if the Supreme Court rules on a topic, we will abide by that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=414.96s)]
*  Here's the cross-exam by Democratic Senator Peters of Hegseth. Let's play it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=418.24s)]
*  ... military actions in Yemen. So given your focus on accountability, how will you demonstrate this accountability to the men and women in the U.S. military [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=422.64s)]
*  if the Inspector General finds that you improperly disclosed information? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=432.24s)]
*  That assessment is pending at this time. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=437.68s)]
*  That is a hypothetical question, but the gentleman's time is expired. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=440.24s)]
*  I think your answer is clear. You are not going to be held accountable. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=448.24s)]
*  Thank you very much, Senator Peters. Senator Mullen. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=451.76s)]
*  Talking about accountability, I wonder who was held accountable for the disastrous withdrawal out of Afghanistan. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so that would be a no right thing to do. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=460.32s)]
*  Here is Democratic Senator Duckworth laying into Hegseth. Let's play it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=462.64s)]
*  ... colleague from Oklahoma. I believe the Secretary of Defense has just responded last week and admitted that [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=466.0s)]
*  the $1 billion mission that he led against the Houthis who do not have a Navy [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=471.68s)]
*  has not restored the transit of U.S. flag commercial vessels through the Red Sea, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=476.88s)]
*  and in fact has resulted in the loss of two FAT-1s. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=480.96s)]
*  ... has not restored the transit of U.S. flag commercial vessels through the Red Sea, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=485.67999999999995s)]
*  and in fact has resulted in the loss of two FAT-1 hornets to the tune of $60 million a piece, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=489.2s)]
*  as well as I believe the last count was seven Reaper drones to the tune of another $200 million. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=497.76s)]
*  You are blowing through money like my fellow cadets and I did in our first liberty after basic camp. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=503.67999999999995s)]
*  Luckily, I didn't end up with a questionable tattoo. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=510.64s)]
*  Your failure as Mr. Secretary since you've taken office has been staggering. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=513.2s)]
*  You sent classified operational information over signal to chest thump in front of your wife, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=517.6800000000001s)]

*  You blew the $1 billion fight against the Houthis, whom again as my colleague says has no Navy, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=525.6s)]
*  and yet you lost all of those aircraft. You've created such a hostile command environment that [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  no one wants to serve as your Chief of Staff or work with you in other senior DOD leadership roles. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=537.36s)]
*  But what we should all be talking about more than all of this is that you have an unjustified, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=542.24s)]
*  un-American misuse of the military in American cities, pulling resources and attention away [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  from core missions to the detriment of the country, the war fighters, and yes, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=552.16s)]
*  the war fighting that you claim to love. I don't know if this is because you are too [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=555.92s)]
*  inexperienced and incompetent to understand the real threats facing our country, or if it's because [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  you are just an unqualified yes man who can't tell the President how to keep Americans safe. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=564.88s)]
*  You are focusing on renaming bases for Confederate generals. You said just now to Senator King that [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=569.6s)]
*  to a man and to a woman, we would rather be associated with the old Confederate names. Well, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=576.32s)]
*  I am one of those women. I served at Fort Rucker, Alabama, a base that was named for a traitor who [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=580.72s)]
*  took arms against the United States of America, led troops who killed Americans. It was renamed [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=586.96s)]
*  for Mike Novosel, a Medal of Honor recipient, who in his citation for the Medal of Honor [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=592.24s)]
*  includes that he saved 29 American lives, to include hovering backwards in a helicopter [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=597.84s)]
*  towards an enemy bunker where a wounded American was laying and saved that person, including [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=604.24s)]
*  after being taken fire himself. I know a little something about what it takes to fly a helicopter [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=611.6800000000001s)]
*  when you've been hit by enemy fire. That was heroic. I'd rather be associated with Mike Novosel [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=616.1600000000001s)]
*  than a failed Confederate traitor. I don't know whether you are inexperienced or too incompetent, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=621.36s)]
*  but I wonder when you will actually focus on our nation's war fighting mission. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=627.76s)]
*  We know that California is just a deliberate systematic political and dangerous campaign [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=632.72s)]
*  led by you. We should not be using our military to pay cops against Americans. General Cain, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=636.88s)]
*  as chairman. You know what's really getting under my skin these days? The price of everything. I [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=642.5600000000001s)]

*  every trip and don't even get me started on how expensive hearing aids can be. Now I've looked [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=651.2s)]
*  into them before for my family members and the price tag, it's just insane. It's like they think [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=655.9200000000001s)]
*  that we all have money growing from money trees or something in our backyards. But I have some [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=660.24s)]
*  good news. Did you know MD Hearing has actually cut their prices in half despite everything getting [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=664.4000000000001s)]

*  in front of federal buildings, they should be rehearsing call for fire missions. We have local [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=840.6400000000001s)]

*  military away from facing foreign enemies who literally say things like, death to America. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=854.16s)]

*  back to its real job. Stop fording them to do DHSs. And if you want to be a DHS secretary, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=864.8s)]
*  maybe you can apply for that job when you're fired from this one due to your incompetence. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=870.16s)]
*  This interest time is expired. Democratic Senator Rosen right here wants to know why is it that [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=874.32s)]
*  right-wing extremist conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer had a say in the firing of General Howe [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=881.44s)]

*  to tell the Democratic Senator, your time is up. And she's like, you don't tell me when my time is [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=897.92s)]

*  Hawk. The sudden inexplicable dismissal of General Hawk. He serves both director of the National [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  Security Agency, commander of US Cybercom. It's deeply concerning, raises significant questions [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=915.8399999999999s)]
*  about the decision-making process, its potential consequences. Public reports [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=921.28s)]
*  indicate that the removal of General Hawk, who has served his country proudly, has been influenced [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=927.36s)]
*  by social media influencer and influence her personality on social media. Laura Loomer [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=933.04s)]
*  spreads conspiracy theories. She's been denounced even by Republicans. And the ideas that any [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=939.52s)]
*  leaders within our agencies responsible for our nation's security, somebody would be dismissed [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=943.92s)]
*  based on the advice of a social media influencer. As alarming to say the least, it's surely not how [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=949.76s)]
*  we should be running our military. So were you consulted regarding General Hawks dismissal? Yes or no? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=955.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, Senator, I would not advise believing everything you read in the media. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=964.16s)]
*  And I'm consulted on every single decision. I'm the decision maker for the department and we all [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=968.16s)]
*  serve as a pleasure of the president. And we have the prerogative to make those decisions. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=972.56s)]
*  What was your recommendation? Did you personally approve Mr. Hawks dismissal? Yes or no? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=976.64s)]
*  Anyone coming or going at the Defense Department, especially at that level, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=982.72s)]
*  would ultimately be a decision made by me. And I stand behind that. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=986.24s)]
*  So that's a yes. Did you personally relieve him? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=989.1999999999999s)]
*  Excuse me? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=991.92s)]
*  Did you personally relieve him? Yes or no? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=992.3199999999999s)]
*  Anyone at that level who is relieved would be relieved by the Secretary of Defense. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=994.3199999999999s)]
*  Was there a specific justification for General Hawks dismissal? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=999.4399999999999s)]
*  Ma'am, we all serve at the pleasure of the president. The president deserves the type [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1014.32s)]
*  of commanders and advisors that he thinks will best equip him to accomplish the mission. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1017.52s)]
*  Did you discuss General Hawks dismissal with Laura Loomer prior to his removal? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1021.76s)]
*  I don't discuss who I talk about anything with, but ultimately this is my decision and he serves [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1025.36s)]
*  at the pleasure of the president and that's why he's no longer there. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1030.72s)]
*  So do you believe it's appropriate for any social media personality to influence personnel decisions [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1033.76s)]
*  in your department, yes or no? I believe your time is up, Senator. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1038.96s)]
*  Oh, it is not up to you to tell me when my time is up. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1046.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, the time is up. And I am going to say, Mr. Secretary, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1049.28s)]
*  you're either feckless or complicit. You're not in control of your department. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1052.88s)]
*  You are as un-serious. It is shocking. You're not combating anti-Semitism within your ranks. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1056.48s)]
*  It's a dangerous and pivotal time in our nation's history. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1061.44s)]
*  And I don't appreciate the smirk, sir. You are the Secretary of Defense. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1066.88s)]
*  The time of the gentlelady has expired. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1071.2s)]
*  One more clip of Democratic Senator Rosen right here. Let's play it. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1073.68s)]
*  So would you also agree then that anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories have no place [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1077.3600000000001s)]
*  in our government or military? Yes or no? They should not. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1083.04s)]
*  Thank you. So would you also agree that anyone who has posted, and I'm going to quote, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1089.44s)]
*  anti-Semitic conspiracy theories lifted right out of a neo-Nazi playbook, end quote, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1094.08s)]
*  shouldn't be anywhere near a position of power? Yes or no? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1100.24s)]
*  Since I don't believe the characterization of many officials in the news media, I would need to see [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1104.4s)]
*  precisely what's being characterized. But generally, would you not say that if [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1112.16s)]
*  we thought something was coming out of a neo-Nazi playbook, it doesn't have any [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1116.64s)]
*  place in our Department of Defense? Now, Secretary Hegsett, the quote that I just read you was [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1122.0800000000002s)]
*  referencing Ms. Kingsley Wilson, the DOD press secretary. It's a direct quote from her, who my [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1127.52s)]
*  Republican colleagues on this committee have also expressed alarm over due to her comments. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1133.92s)]
*  In fact, one colleague said, and I'm going to quote again, obviously, I don't agree with her [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Pl0kysUko&t=1138.3200000000002s)]
