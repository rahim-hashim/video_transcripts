# Trump has BAD MELTDOWN and threatens NUCLEAR WAR
**MeidasTouch:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ)
*  Donald Trump is having a complete meltdown this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=0.0s)]
*  He's behaving like an absolute lunatic. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=3.2s)]
*  But what else is new? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=5.44s)]
*  He appears to be threatening nuclear war with Russia. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=6.84s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump just posted on social media moments ago. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=10.96s)]
*  Did I hear former president Medvedev from Russia casually [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=15.08s)]
*  throwing around the N word nuclear exclamation point and saying that he [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=20.64s)]
*  and other countries would supply nuclear warheads to Iran? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=26.96s)]
*  Did he really say that? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=32.04s)]
*  Or is it just a figment of my imagination? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=33.52s)]
*  If he did say that, and if confirmed, please let me know immediately. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=37.56s)]
*  And Donald Trump puts immediately in all caps. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  The N word should not be treated so casually. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=45.68s)]
*  I guess that's why Putin's the boss. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=49.44s)]
*  And he puts that in caps. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=52.52s)]
*  By the way, if anyone thinks our hardware, and he puts that in quotes, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=54.0s)]
*  was great over the weekend, far and away the strongest and best equipment we have. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=59.0s)]
*  20 years advanced over the pack is our nuclear submarines. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=64.28s)]
*  They are the most powerful and lethal weapons ever built [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=69.12s)]
*  and just launched the 30 Tomahawks. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=72.72s)]
*  All 30 hit their mark perfectly. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=75.92s)]
*  So in addition to our great fighter pilots, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=78.6s)]
*  thank you to the captain and crew exclamation point. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=82.12s)]
*  These are the rantings and ravings of an absolute lunatic who this morning is [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=86.4s)]
*  threatening nuclear war, is calling it the N word and is saying, did I hear [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=91.32s)]
*  former Russian president Medvedev say that he was going to use the N word [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=96.72s)]
*  and that he was going to supply Iran with nuclear warheads? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=102.76s)]
*  This is what Donald Trump is talking about this morning. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  This is what he's posting on social media. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=110.12s)]
*  He was also panic posting the following this morning as well. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=112.84s)]
*  This is all in caps. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=116.96s)]
*  Everyone keep oil prices down. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=118.84s)]
*  I'm watching exclamation point. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  You're playing right into the hands of the enemy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=125.28s)]
*  Exclamation point. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=126.28s)]
*  That's what you're posting in the morning. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=128.48s)]
*  You sound like a panicked lunatic. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=131.24s)]
*  He then posts the following as well, straight from the central planning [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=134.2s)]
*  department of the Trump regime to the Department of Energy drill, baby drill, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=138.44s)]
*  drill, baby drill. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=144.4s)]
*  And I mean now exclamation point, does he think the Department of Energy [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=145.68s)]
*  does the drilling drill, baby drill Department of Energy? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  Oh, and then he also attacked a Republican Congress member, Thomas Massey [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=157.16s)]
*  of Kentucky, get this bum out of office ASAP. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=162.36s)]
*  Get this bum out of office ASAP exclamation point. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=166.68s)]
*  Now, oil prices are surging, which you're going to feel at the pump soon as inflation [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=170.28s)]
*  continues to rise, as unemployment continues to rise, as GDP continues to contract. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  Oil prices are surging in the wake of US strikes in Iran. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  The US oil futures jumped 3.6 percent Sunday to about $76.47 per barrel. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  And it seems that it's only going to be getting higher with rhetoric like Donald [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=198.2s)]
*  Trump is using this morning. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=203.04s)]
*  One of the main issues is whether or not Iran will shut down the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=205.32s)]
*  And the Strait of Hormuz passes right by Iran and Oman. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=211.76s)]
*  At least two supertankers made U-turns at the Strait of Hormuz following the US [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=216.68s)]
*  military strikes in Iran. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  Ship tracking data shows as more than a week of violence in the region is prompting [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=224.24s)]
*  vessels to speed, pause or alter their journeys. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=230.12s)]
*  Also, the United States State Department sent out a notice to all Americans in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=234.56s)]
*  Qatar to shelter in place that their lives are in jeopardy as a result of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=240.44s)]
*  potentially being targeted following the United States strikes on Iran. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=246.56s)]
*  George Conway posted the following, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=253.12s)]
*  doesn't have a clue about the law of supply and demand. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=270.44s)]
*  That's in response to Donald Trump's post this morning. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=274.84s)]
*  Everyone keep oil prices down. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=277.84s)]
*  You're going to fall right into the enemy's hands. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  Keep oil prices down. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  George Perks writes, it turns out creating a situation where 25 percent of global [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=283.56s)]
*  petroleum liquids might go offline at any minute has an impact on oil prices. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=288.68s)]
*  Who could have guessed that? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=294.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, Iran's military central command spokesperson issued the following [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=295.8s)]
*  statement, Mr. Trump the gambler, you may start this war, but we will be the ones [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=301.04s)]
*  who end it as we look at some of the high resolution satellite imagery of the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  Fordow nuclear facility. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=311.68s)]
*  It does not appear that the facility was completely destroyed. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  It does appear it was damaged. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=318.8s)]
*  But we do see here, if you look at this photo and you zoom in, you'll see 16 cargo [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=320.68s)]
*  trucks were entering tunnels at Iran's Fordow nuclear facility shortly before [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=325.56s)]
*  the US Israeli strike, raising concerns that Tehran may have secretly relocated [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=330.88s)]
*  enriched uranium or critical nuclear minerals ahead of the bombing. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=336.2s)]
*  Lots of people were also saying that as a result of Donald Trump's social media [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=340.92s)]
*  posts and Trump's behavior and his statements like, oh, we're planning [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=344.76s)]
*  something far bigger than a ceasefire, far bigger than a ceasefire, that Donald [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=349.36s)]
*  Trump also tipped off Iran for what was going to happen so that they were able to [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=354.52s)]
*  limit the damage that was actually being caused. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  I think Jake Bro makes a good point here when he shows this photo of former [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=362.59999999999997s)]
*  presidents giving speeches to the American people at the White House and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  contrast it with Donald Trump. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=372.32s)]
*  Jake goes, I have never seen a US president that was so weak and so scared [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=374.44s)]
*  about talking military action that he needed his yes, men entourage to keep him [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=379.76s)]
*  company at the podium in the cross hall. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=385.68s)]
*  Donald Trump came out there with JD Vance, Marco Rubio and Pete Hegseth versus in the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=389.08s)]
*  past commanders in chief addressing the American people directly from the New [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  York Times over the past 24 hours. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  Trump's incessant tweets gave away his war plans and convinced the Iranians to [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=402.96s)]
*  hide a ton of uranium. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=408.16s)]
*  Nice job, Donald. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=410.72s)]
*  And who do we have right now as running counterterrorism in the United States? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=412.44s)]
*  This guy, Thomas Fugate, 22 year old. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=418.32s)]
*  He was a grocery store clerk and that's what he was doing. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=422.08s)]
*  But he was a big maga person. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=426.96s)]
*  And that's ultimately why I was reading the what the meme actually says. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=431.64s)]
*  But he was a grocery store clerk and that's why he was a big maga supporter, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=436.40000000000003s)]
*  ultimately picked by Trump because he was a big maga fan, has no counterterrorism [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=441.72s)]
*  experience before. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=446.2s)]
*  Is listening to the craziness of the world making you just want to cuddle up on the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=447.28000000000003s)]

*  Smalls is possibly my favorite sponsor ever because my cat Chubbs is frankly [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=511.32000000000005s)]
*  obsessed. I use Smalls as a topper to transition Chubbs to Smalls and the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=515.6800000000001s)]

*  switched to Smalls. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=526.6400000000001s)]

*  Pat Ryan, a veteran who served two combat tours in Iraq, says the following. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=560.96s)]
*  Trump is claiming his strikes on Iran made the American people safer. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=566.24s)]
*  He is dangerously wrong. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=570.2800000000001s)]
*  I served two combat tours in Iraq and am now in the Armed Service Committee. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=571.9200000000001s)]
*  His actions were not only unconstitutional, they have made America less safe. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=576.04s)]
*  Not more. Here's why. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=580.32s)]
*  Within hours of strikes, Trump said the nuclear facilities were completely and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=581.76s)]
*  totally obliterated. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=585.8s)]
*  This was literally impossible to know. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=587.24s)]
*  A battle damage assessment takes days or even weeks, especially given the secretive [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=589.64s)]
*  and fortified nature of all three targets. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=594.52s)]
*  This morning, Chairman Kaine made it clear it was far too soon to know whether Iran's [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=596.84s)]
*  nuclear program was destroyed. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=601.08s)]
*  I hope and pray the strike was successful, but there's a real chance the operation [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=602.6800000000001s)]
*  wasn't fully effective. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=606.52s)]
*  If so, the risk to the US is dramatically higher. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=607.5600000000001s)]
*  Iran now has every motivation to break out and develop nuclear weapon as quickly as [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=611.0s)]
*  possible. Given the lack of clear rationale for why this preventative strike was needed [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=615.64s)]
*  and what exactly it was capable of achieving, this is an incredibly dangerous amount of [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=620.96s)]
*  risk to take on. I know Trump said he now wants peace. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=625.6s)]
*  I share that goal. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=628.64s)]
*  The problem is that, as Secretary Mattis always says, in war, the enemy gets a vote. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=629.96s)]
*  We have 40,000 troops in theater. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=635.24s)]
*  The risk of an Iranian or proxy counterattack is much higher. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=637.2s)]
*  I'm praying for their safety. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=640.64s)]
*  It's not just conventional attacks from Iran, ballistic missiles, drones I'm worried [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=642.4s)]
*  about. It's asymmetric escalation. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=646.2s)]
*  Cyber closing the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=648.4s)]
*  Militant groups in Iraq deciding they have nothing to lose. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=650.6s)]
*  It's God forbid a strike on the homeland. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  I love our country. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=655.72s)]
*  I proudly put my life on the line to keep the American people safe. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=657.0s)]
*  And I'm under no illusions about the Iranian regime. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=660.6s)]
*  It's evil. But war is hell. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=663.08s)]
*  And Trump just introduced an incredible amount of risk and volatility into the global [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=664.76s)]
*  order. For a guy who ran on keeping us out of war, this is a total 180. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=670.16s)]
*  And he did it without ever making the case to the American people or involving Congress [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=674.56s)]
*  or even getting on the same page as his own director of national intelligence. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=679.56s)]
*  That's deeply wrong and un-American. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=684.24s)]
*  We need to have an honest conversation as a country about what comes next. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=686.44s)]
*  And we cannot repeat our approach from 2001 and 2002. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=690.36s)]
*  The answer cannot be. We'll figure it out as we go. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=694.6800000000001s)]
*  I lost too many friends because of that logic. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=697.9200000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, you have MAGA Republican Senator Joni Ernst from Iowa. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=701.24s)]
*  She says this is not a war. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=706.2800000000001s)]
*  We're not actually in a war. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=708.6400000000001s)]
*  This was just a strike. This is not a war. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=710.2800000000001s)]
*  Here's what she says. Play this clip. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=712.5200000000001s)]
*  They do not want to see a war. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=714.2s)]
*  This is not a war. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=716.44s)]
*  This was a strike on a threat to the United States of America. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=717.88s)]
*  I would say as well, this is retribution, Harris, for the thousands of American [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=723.36s)]
*  lives that have been taken by Iran through direct strikes from Iran, as well as [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=728.76s)]
*  their terrorist proxies. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=733.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, you've got MAGA Republican Congress member Pat Harrington on Fox saying, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=735.1600000000001s)]
*  We're trying to lower the temperature by raising the temperature. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=741.12s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=744.3199999999999s)]
*  Be with you. Look, this is certainly a dynamic environment, right? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=745.28s)]
*  We're trying to lower the temperature of global conflict while simultaneously kind [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=748.16s)]
*  of raising it here in order to lower it. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=752.5999999999999s)]
*  And so I think the Secretary of State Marco Rubio is exactly right. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=754.76s)]
*  It would be Iran's worst decision possible to this point. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=758.64s)]
*  They've made a lot of bad decisions up till this juncture to come back and attack [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=762.3599999999999s)]
*  America or American troops. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=767.4s)]
*  I genuinely hope that they don't do that, but we'll just have to wait and see here. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=769.92s)]
*  Then you had MAGA Republican Congress member Keith Self threatening to bomb [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=774.88s)]
*  downtown Tehran. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=779.32s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=780.72s)]
*  I don't think they'll go big because if the president has promised, if they go big [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=781.84s)]
*  with major missile strikes against our assets, we'll go back downtown Tehran, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=786.28s)]
*  probably. But yes, it is time for them to come to the table, to come to the table, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=791.08s)]
*  to negotiate the peace that we have demonstrated. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=797.24s)]
*  The president is serious when he says the U.S. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=800.16s)]
*  will demonstrate peace through strength. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=802.96s)]
*  We did that. Now it's time for Iran to come back to the table and make a deal [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=805.84s)]
*  with the president. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=811.0s)]
*  All right, we will be watching very closely, of course. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=811.96s)]
*  And then moments ago in front of the White House, you had Donald Trump's faith [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=814.36s)]
*  office praying and speaking in tongues at the White House. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=817.88s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=821.0s)]
*  This is the time. And so we declare right now for the capital of our nation, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=822.36s)]
*  that America will come back to God. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=827.24s)]
*  We will come back to God. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=829.52s)]
*  Nothing will stop this nation. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=831.32s)]
*  And we speak right now by the authority of. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=833.4s)]
*  That's what's going on in the White House right now. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=836.12s)]
*  Donald Trump threatening nuclear war against Russia and calling it the N-word. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGboRoFvEQ&t=838.4s)]
