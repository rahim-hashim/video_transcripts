# ðŸš¨ ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE as Trump DECLARES WAR on LA
**MeidasTouch:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4)
*  We have, oh my God, we have tear gas, we have fireworks going off, tear gas is in the air, people are dispersing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=0.0s)]
*  I can't see anything. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=6.72s)]
*  That was a scene from last night in Los Angeles as the Trump regime quite literally declared war on its own citizens. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=9.84s)]
*  The Trump regime invoked 10 USC section 12406, which is entirely inapplicable to what's taking place, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=18.2s)]
*  and it's invalid the way Trump invoked it because it requires a governor's consent, which did not take place here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=28.12s)]
*  But the Trump regime issued a memo federalizing the National Guard in California to go against the people of California [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  based on a manufactured situation that the Trump regime provoked by sending ICE to attack communities [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=44.44s)]
*  and to provoke and cause chaos in communities in Los Angeles and in the adjacent areas to Los Angeles. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=54.32s)]
*  The memo that Donald Trump issued last night while he was at a UFC fight, mind you, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=61.2s)]
*  is called the Department of Defense Security for the Protection of Department of Homeland Security Functions memo. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=66.92s)]
*  And as I said, it invokes section 10 USC 12406, and I'll go explain to you what that means in a little bit. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=72.72s)]
*  But let's just go back a little bit. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=79.84s)]
*  Over the past few days, the Trump regime was conducting ICE raids in downtown Los Angeles to start. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=81.24s)]
*  They were targeting apparel factories where migrants were hard at work. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=89.36s)]
*  They were targeting courthouses where migrants were going through a lawful process to have their cases heard. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  They were targeting neighborhoods where migrants were raising their families. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=102.44s)]
*  They were targeting areas where migrants were peaceful and contributing to the economy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=108.84s)]
*  Home depots, parking lots. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=114.44s)]
*  They were not going after criminals or gang bangers. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=116.84s)]
*  They were going after peaceful, hardworking migrants, which Donald Trump purportedly told his base that he was not going to do. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=120.52s)]
*  But we all told you that he was lying. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=129.12s)]
*  So that happened yesterday. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=131.84s)]
*  Then on or that happened on Friday. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  Then on Saturday, the Trump regime expanded the operation to the areas surrounding the city of Los Angeles, still within the county. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=135.92s)]
*  Areas like Paramount and Santa Fe, areas like Compton, a lot of areas, Torrance, surrounding the city itself within the county. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=146.2s)]
*  And again, they were specifically targeting communities where there were hardworking Latino families just going about working [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=157.64s)]
*  or living their peaceful lives or just trying to raise their families. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=165.28s)]
*  Why? The Trump regime wanted to provoke something that they could essentially claim was an insurrection so that they could federalize the National Guard, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=168.84s)]
*  which they ended up doing last night, and send the troops against the people of California. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=178.32s)]
*  So let's just take a look at some of the scenes of what went down yesterday. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=185.0s)]
*  Here was a video where you can see some less than lethal rounds, which are still could be very lethal, being used against protesters in Southern California. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  This was in an area called Paramount, which is about 10 to 15 miles kind of south of Los Angeles. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=200.2s)]
*  Take a look right here of what went down. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=208.27999999999997s)]
*  These proud dispersal tactics being used on protesters that are protesting in Paramount, California. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=220.64s)]
*  Those in the area basically call this Compton. It's outside of a Home Depot. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=228.64s)]
*  Where protests began earlier today. And there we see those gas canisters. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=237.64s)]
*  The people covering their eyes, their mouths, their noses. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=245.64s)]
*  These pepper balls impact all of the senses. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=252.64s)]
*  And this is a big show that they're doing here. A big display of the less than lethal rounds. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=257.64s)]
*  Here's another just insane scene of what we were seeing yesterday with ICE out and about in Paramount. Play this clip. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=263.64s)]
*  Here's another image of the ICE raid. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=274.64s)]
*  And you'll see community resistance in front of this Home Depot in Paramount. Take a look. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=290.64s)]
*  F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=304.64s)]
*  promote [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=334.64s)]
*  Here's another image of what was going down in Paramount. Play this clip. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=349.74s)]
*  A lot of this footage was captured on the Citizen app [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=361.56s)]
*  as well. Like here you have a new video of some of the ice attacks on the immigrants. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=364.32s)]
*  This is in Inglewood from yesterday. Here play this clip. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=371.84s)]
*  So with all of that taking place, you know, Stephen Miller then put out a statement that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=394.32s)]
*  this is an insurrection, an insurrection against the laws and sovereignty of the United States. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=404.56s)]
*  Then Tom Homan went on TV and he said, oh, you know, we're going to have to activate, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=410.24s)]
*  you know, the National Guard. We're going to have to federalize it. So we were wondering, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=416.4s)]
*  are they going to federalize the National Guard? Are they going to invoke the Insurrection Act? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=420.92s)]
*  They actually technically didn't invoke the Insurrection Act. They invoked another act that [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=426.92s)]
*  allows you to federalize the National Guard if you're the president, but you have to work [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=433.0s)]
*  with the governor and it's under very narrow circumstances. So I'll go and break that down. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=437.88s)]
*  So while Donald Trump was at a UFC fight, he posts the following. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=442.68s)]
*  If Governor Gavin Newsom of California and Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles can't do their jobs, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=446.28s)]
*  which everyone knows they can't, then the federal government will step in and solve the problem, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  riots and looters, the way it should be solved. Just take a look at this map here. You can see [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=457.47999999999996s)]
*  all of the areas here with potential ice sightings and you'll see, you know, really from downtown [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=462.28s)]
*  Los Angeles, it kind of expands out. Let's talk briefly about the statute that Donald Trump invoked, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=468.2s)]
*  10 USC, section 12406. It's not the Insurrection Act. The Insurrection Act is 10 USC, section 253. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=475.64s)]
*  But just take a look at what 12406, what Donald Trump invoked actually says. Here's what it says, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=487.56s)]
*  whenever one, the United States or any of the commonwealths or possessions is invaded or is [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=494.36s)]
*  in danger of invasion by a foreign nation, that didn't happen. Two, there is a rebellion or danger [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=500.84s)]
*  of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States. Well, that [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=508.84s)]
*  didn't happen. Three, the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=514.1999999999999s)]
*  United States. And again, that didn't happen. The president may call into federal service [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=521.56s)]
*  members and units of the National Guard of any state in such numbers as he considers necessary [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=527.72s)]
*  to repel the invasion, suppress the rebellion or execute those laws. Orders for these purposes [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=533.8s)]
*  shall be issued through the governors of the states. That didn't happen. Or in the case of [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=541.24s)]
*  the District of Columbia, through the commanding general of the National Guard of the District of [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=547.48s)]
*  Columbia. So you see right there, subparagraph one, two and three, I read them for you. None of [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=553.32s)]
*  those were met to be able to invoke 10 USC 12406. And then it says that the orders for these purposes [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=559.5600000000001s)]
*  shall be issued through the governors. These were not issued through California Governor Gavin [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=568.12s)]
*  Newsom. Gavin Newsom came out with a statement that Donald Trump federalizing the National Guard [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=572.9200000000001s)]
*  is wholly improper. It's to sow chaos and that Governor Newsom is very much against it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=578.68s)]
*  So what Donald Trump did in federalizing the California National Guard unlawfully, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=584.76s)]
*  when you go and you read this memo, it says that the members and units of the National Guard called [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=590.12s)]
*  into federal service shall be at least 2000 National Guard personnel. And the duration of the duty [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=596.1999999999999s)]
*  shall be for 60 days or at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=603.64s)]
*  In addition, the Secretary of Defense may employ any other members of the regular armed forces [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=610.28s)]
*  as necessary to augment and support the protection of federal functions and property in any number [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=616.68s)]
*  determined appropriate in his discretion. Again, that is not permitted in the section that I read [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=623.48s)]
*  you, 10 USC 12406. All that was in there was federalizing the National Guard. Not that [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=629.72s)]
*  Pete Hegseth can send the Navy or the Marines or the Air Force or the Army against the United States [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=636.52s)]
*  citizens. But that's actually exactly what Pete Hegseth wants to do. I'm not being hyperbolic. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=645.1600000000001s)]
*  Pete Hegseth posted that he is considering putting the Marines, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=651.32s)]
*  will be mobilized. They are now on high alert to attack the citizens of the United States of [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=660.2800000000001s)]
*  America. As we wrote on the Midas Touch channel, Pete Hegseth is now threatening to send the Marines [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=666.5200000000001s)]
*  into Los Angeles. Make no mistake, this is a declaration of war against the United States. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=673.24s)]
*  Here's what Secretary of Defense, former Fox host Pete Hegseth posted. The violent mob assaults on [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=679.24s)]
*  ICE and federal law enforcement are designed to prevent the removal of criminal illegal aliens [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=686.28s)]
*  from our soil, a dangerous invasion facilitated by criminal cartels, aka foreign terrorist [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=692.6s)]
*  organizations, and a huge national security risk. And he puts that in caps. Under President Trump, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=700.84s)]
*  violence and destruction against federal agents and federal facilities will not be tolerated. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=707.8000000000001s)]
*  It's, and he puts this in caps, common sense. The Department of Defense is mobilizing the [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=713.4s)]
*  National Guard immediately to support federal law enforcement in Los Angeles. And if violence [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=718.36s)]
*  continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized. They are on high alert. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=724.6s)]
*  So I'm not being hyperbolic. The United States Department of Defense is threatening to send [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=732.76s)]
*  the United States Marines against American citizens in California, literally going to war [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=739.24s)]
*  against people in California. Now, I want to be very clear. How did this all start? ICE raids [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=747.64s)]
*  sent by the Trump regime to terrorize peaceful communities. These ICE raids targeted courtrooms, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=755.0s)]
*  courthouses, ICE agents waiting in bushes as people were going through their lawful process. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=762.92s)]
*  They were going to court. They were showing up to court on time to deal with their asylum claims or [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=767.96s)]
*  their immigration, their pending immigration claims. That's where they were getting snatched [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=775.8s)]
*  and disappeared from and put in detention centers. Kids were being grabbed. Babies were being grabbed. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=780.12s)]
*  They were inflicting torture on the people. ICE was inflicted torture. Then they went to home [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=785.56s)]
*  depots. They went to factories where people were hard at work. And then they were snatching people [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=791.48s)]
*  and disappearing them and they were pissing off the community. So was there some social unrest [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=797.7199999999999s)]
*  or societal unrest that occurred? So stipulated. I've showed you some of the videos. People were [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=804.44s)]
*  pissed off that their family members were being disappeared, that people in their communities were [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=810.36s)]
*  being snatched, that hardworking people were basically going to be sent off and they were sent [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=815.48s)]
*  to areas that they left and got asylum here, being sent off to get killed. So yeah, especially [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=820.2800000000001s)]
*  knowing that you could end up in a concentration camp in El Salvador or Libya. So yes, people in [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=826.44s)]
*  California and across the country were pissed and upset. Was it something that the California [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=832.36s)]
*  could deal with on its own through the California police officers, Los Angeles police officer CHP? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=839.08s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, you know, these protests, sure they were somewhat sizable, but they weren't like [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=845.72s)]
*  huge massive protests that were taking place. The fact that they were talking about sending the [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=853.24s)]
*  Marines right now to attack American citizens tells you that's what they've wanted from the [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=858.76s)]
*  very beginning. It's what I've always been saying that they wanted to provoke. They want to send the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=865.0s)]
*  military against the United States citizens. And I have one other theory that I think is pretty [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=870.28s)]
*  accurate. So next weekend is the Trump regime's birthday party for Donald Trump, where they are [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=876.28s)]
*  doing the big dictatorship military parade. We've never had that in America with tanks and, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=883.4s)]
*  you know, going through Washington, D.C. and displaying missiles and things like that. How [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=890.52s)]
*  anti-American is that? But that's what Trump wants on his birthday, a big Kim Jong-un, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=897.16s)]
*  Vladimir Putin style dictator parade for himself on June 14th for his birthday. What else was June 14th? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=902.1999999999999s)]
*  The no-kings protests were going to take place across the United States of America, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=909.88s)]
*  and I expected there to be literally millions to tens of millions of Americans attending the [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=915.4799999999999s)]
*  no-kings protests. So what I think also the Trump regime is trying to do is I think they're trying [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=921.0799999999999s)]
*  to create a situation of martial law. I think they want the military to suppress every, you know, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=927.16s)]
*  all of the citizenry in anticipation of Donald Trump's dictator parade, where I think Donald [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=933.88s)]
*  Trump wants to show the dictatorship power that's never existed in the United States. He wants that [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=939.48s)]
*  display. And I think this escalation that we're seeing right now leading up to his dictator parade, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=945.64s)]
*  I don't think that's coincidental. There's a lot of other videos I can show you. I think you get [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=952.9200000000001s)]
*  the point from that, what was taking place. They were raiding downtown L.A., raiding the surrounding [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=957.96s)]
*  areas within the 10-, 15-, 20-mile radius of downtown L.A., going into the factories. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=963.8s)]
*  Immunity members were pissed. And then the Trump regime immediately invoked, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=970.5999999999999s)]
*  and I read you those categories unlawfully, section 10 U.S. Code, section 12406. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TD5rTXj-_4&t=975.64s)]
