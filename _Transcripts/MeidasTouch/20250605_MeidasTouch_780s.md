# Trump gets SMOTHERED by BAD NEWS and LOOKS SICKLY
**MeidasTouch:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y)
*  Donald Trump was looking sickly, fatigued, out of breath yesterday, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=0.0s)]
*  as he was basically cornered like a rat internationally, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=6.4s)]
*  being Vladimir Putin's stooge and basically reading press releases from Putin, saying, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=11.76s)]
*  Putin's gonna have to respond very strongly to the Ukrainian attacks on Russia, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=17.68s)]
*  being a Putin mouthpiece on his social media platform. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=23.6s)]
*  And then you had Elon Musk just relentlessly putting the dagger into Donald Trump, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  mocking Trump and the disastrous budget bill over and over again. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=34.8s)]
*  Elon Musk was posting comments from Fox viewers who said that they felt betrayed by Donald Trump. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=39.36s)]
*  And Trump was pretty much MIA. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=47.84s)]
*  He's pretty much been MIA since last Friday when he showed up at the Pittsburgh Steel factory, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=50.64s)]
*  the US Steel, and he lied to all the steel workers, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=58.64s)]
*  you're all gonna get $5,000 bonuses and Nippon Steel is not really acquiring US Steel, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=61.84s)]
*  US will have full control. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=69.76s)]
*  Liar, liar, liar. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=71.52s)]
*  How do you know Donald Trump's lying? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=73.2s)]
*  Because he's opening up his mouth. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  So we didn't really see Donald Trump this weekend. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=76.88s)]
*  By the way, I'm not really complaining. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=79.28s)]
*  We didn't see him on Monday. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=81.12s)]
*  He really wasn't anywhere on Tuesday. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=82.8s)]
*  And then on Wednesday, he did this weird mini, not a press conference. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=86.88s)]
*  He did this prerecorded video from the Oval Office and his face looked all puffy and strange. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=93.76s)]
*  And then he showed up at what he called the summer soiree at the White House [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=100.88s)]
*  for about, he gave like a 10 minute speech on the balcony of the White House. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=106.4s)]
*  Like, well, it has those COVID 2020 vibes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=111.36s)]
*  But you have Elon Musk making posts like this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  Elon Post does a meme where he goes, here's the money that Doge saved. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=117.84s)]
*  And then he does a picture of a train hitting the bus. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  Trump's big, beautiful bill destroying what Doge did. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Let me be very clear. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=130.72s)]
*  Doge was an absolute disaster. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=132.08s)]
*  There's significantly more federal spending month over month now than under former President Biden. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=133.84s)]
*  So let's not in any way imagine that Doge was a success. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=139.84s)]
*  I think Congress is going to pass a rescission bill and claim that Doge cut about $9.3 billion. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=143.6s)]
*  With all the essential services that Doge got rid of, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=151.52s)]
*  it's going to lead to trillions of dollars more being added to our deficit. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=154.96s)]
*  But this is how Elon Musk is mocking Donald Trump over and over again. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=159.6s)]
*  Elon Musk calls for a new spending bill should be drafted that doesn't massively grow the deficit [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=164.0s)]
*  and increase the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump sheepish. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=175.28s)]
*  Sheepish. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=177.28s)]
*  He's telling people behind the scenes that he's very, very angry. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=177.92s)]
*  But he is a taco. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump always chickens out. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  He's a chicken. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=189.04s)]
*  You stand up. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  You watching Elon Musk bully Trump and also, I guess in his own way, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=191.04s)]
*  have his own version of like, compromise on Trump. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=196.56s)]
*  Just think about Trump's like, I don't know what to do. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=200.64s)]
*  You have Donald Trump being outmaneuvered by Putin. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  You have Zelensky Europe being like, all right, Trump's a, what a weak, vile, pathetic thing that is. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=206.56s)]
*  We're going to stand up for ourselves and Europe leaning in on its defense of Ukraine. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=213.44s)]
*  And we're seeing Canada look to Europe, Australia look to Europe. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=219.44s)]
*  Heck, we're seeing meetings between the European Union and China potentially scheduled for July, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=223.28s)]
*  leaving the United States all isolated. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=230.8s)]
*  But this one, this is how I think Trump's team is trying to leak it to right-wing press. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=233.12s)]
*  I think Trump might be working in tandem with Elon here to tank his own bill in a 4D chess move. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=239.68s)]
*  As our editor in chief, Ron Filipkowski goes, ah, yes, taco is playing 4D chess once again. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=250.0s)]
*  How could we not realize that? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=259.52s)]
*  But while Donald Trump fatigued, sickly looking, hiding, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=262.4s)]
*  he did a number of very, very kind of cruel things today with a lot of major implications. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=267.52s)]
*  So let me go through what he did. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=273.12s)]
*  He reversed former president Biden's executive order that was critical for women getting [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=275.36s)]
*  reproductive emergency abortion care. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  The Trump regime ended emergency abortion requirement for hospitals. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=285.84s)]
*  The Biden era guidance now overturned, directed hospitals to perform abortions [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  when needed to protect pregnant patients whose life was in jeopardy. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=296.08s)]
*  Donald Trump says, nope, if your life is in jeopardy, you should die. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump signed a proclamation through an executive order suspending visas [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=305.84s)]
*  for new Harvard international students. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=313.2s)]
*  Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum directing an investigation [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=316.32s)]
*  into who ran the United States while president Biden was in office. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=322.56s)]
*  It's always deranged, unhinged, sickening conspiracies with these magas, right? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=328.72s)]
*  It's one thing to the next because what are they trying to distract from? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=334.48s)]
*  No peace in Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=338.64s)]
*  By the way, Donald Trump's post yesterday where he parroted Putin's talking points, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=341.28s)]
*  literally a social media post like promoting Putin's propaganda. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=345.92s)]
*  Trump said it was a great call with Putin. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate peace. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  Putin said that he will very strongly retaliate against Ukraine. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=359.76s)]
*  So how is that a good call that's not going to lead to an immediate peace? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, it's not Putin retaliating against Ukraine. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=369.2s)]
*  Vladimir Putin every day has been sending Shaheed drones and ballistic missiles [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=372.4s)]
*  to kill innocent Ukrainians every single day. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=378.72s)]
*  And Ukraine defending itself, attack the weapons that are attacking innocent Ukrainians. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=384.16s)]
*  You cowardly fool you, you vile piece of trash. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=390.8s)]
*  And I know sometimes people go, hey, Ben, stop with the name calling. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=394.56s)]
*  We like the more Mr. Rogers approach. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  Chill out with the name calling. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  But I'm sorry. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=402.16s)]
*  When Donald Trump is out there literally doing social media posts [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=403.36s)]
*  that are like more Russian propaganda than RT, it riles my blood sometimes. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=408.16s)]
*  And it makes me just utterly pissed. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=414.48s)]
*  Oh, by the way, great job, Columbia University. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=416.48s)]
*  Y'all sucked up to Donald Trump and tried to appease him and cave to all of his demands. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  And now the Trump regime says Columbia failed to meet the standards to be accredited. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=425.68s)]
*  And they want to remove you as an accredited university. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=432.48s)]
*  And Columbia sucked up to Donald Trump, did everything Trump said. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=436.72s)]
*  By the way, it was what? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  It was on May 28th, 2025, Donald Trump said, Harvard needs to act more like Columbia. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=441.6s)]
*  And do what I say. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=448.08000000000004s)]
*  Want me to prove to you he said that? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump said May 28th, 2025. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  You know, Columbia has been really, they were very, very bad what they've done. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=454.56s)]
*  They're very anti-Semitic and lots of other things. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=459.20000000000005s)]
*  But they're working with us on finding a solution. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=462.64000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, they're taking off that hot seat. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=466.4s)]
*  But Harvard wants to fight. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=468.96s)]
*  They want to show how smart they are. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=470.32s)]
*  And they're getting their ass kicked. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=471.91999999999996s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=473.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=475.12s)]
*  And yesterday, Donald Trump says that Columbia can't get accredited anymore. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=476.4s)]
*  So you can't appease this guy. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=481.91999999999996s)]
*  He's a taco. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=484.79999999999995s)]
*  He always chickens out. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  You know what you got to do to bullies? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=487.68s)]
*  You got to bully him back. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=489.76s)]
*  You got to stand up. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  You got to call them out. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=493.91999999999996s)]
*  You can never capitulate. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=495.36s)]
*  We live once. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=496.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ovATw5H7Y&t=498.24s)]
