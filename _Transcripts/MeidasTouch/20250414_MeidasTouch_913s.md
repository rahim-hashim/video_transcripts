# Trump has MELTDOWN and gets BOOED EVERYWHERE
**MeidasTouch:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY)
*  That's so rich! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=0.0s)]
*  Look what you did there, Donald. That's in Salt Lake City, Utah, where 20,000 people, or 10% of the people in the city, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=7.5s)]
*  showed up to protest you to fight the oligarchy and rally behind Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman AOC on Sunday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=14.8s)]
*  The people across the country are fed up and pissed off at you and Musk, your deranged and dangerous behavior. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=24.1s)]
*  Like last night, Donald Trump was posting this while that event was taking place in Salt Lake City. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=32.6s)]
*  He goes, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=38.6s)]
*  Almost every week, 60 minutes, which is being sued for billions of dollars for the fraud they committed in the 2024 presidential election. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=39.300000000000004s)]
*  With their interview, a failed presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, mentions the name Trump in a derogatory and defamatory way. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=49.1s)]
*  But this weekend's broadcast tops them all. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=56.6s)]
*  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. This goes on with an alternation between all caps and lowercase and incoherent sentences. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=59.1s)]
*  But then at the end of Donald Trump's post, he goes, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=67.1s)]
*  They, being CBS and 60 Minutes, should lose their license. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=69.6s)]
*  Hopefully, the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, as headed by its highly respected chairman, Brendan Carr, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=74.1s)]
*  will impose the maximum fines and punishment, which is substantial for their unlawful and illegal behavior. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=81.1s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump is doing on Sunday. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=88.6s)]
*  Engaging in his authoritarian fantasies on social media and directing his FCC commissioner to attack 60 Minutes, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=92.1s)]
*  who, by the way, Donald Trump sued in the Northern District of Texas with Ronny Jackson because they claim they were consumers, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=102.6s)]
*  who were injured by the way 60 Minutes interviewed former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 election [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=111.1s)]
*  because Trump didn't like the way it was edited because they took out some of her mmms and ahhs [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=118.6s)]
*  when Trump was too afraid to show up for that interview himself and only former Vice President Kamala Harris did the interview. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=123.6s)]
*  So Donald Trump and Ronny Jackson, the pathetic fools they are, are suing 60 Minutes, guess this, for about $20 to $25 billion [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=130.1s)]
*  because they say their feelings were hurt from the 2024 election. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=139.6s)]
*  And that's why Donald Trump is whining this evening, by the way, or last night, as he's imploding the bond markets [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=143.6s)]
*  as the 5, 10, 30-year Treasury yields are reaching heights, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=151.1s)]
*  demonstrative of genuine and real chaos in the United States markets in an unprecedented way. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=156.1s)]
*  Let me just share with you that crowd size one more time so you can see what 20,000 people in Salt Lake City [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=163.6s)]
*  rising up to fight the oligarchy looks like. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=169.6s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=171.6s)]
*  Thank you Utah! [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=174.6s)]
*  And by the way, here was Senator Bernie Sanders the day before. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=181.6s)]
*  First he spoke in front of a huge crowd in Los Angeles, 36,000 people. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=185.6s)]
*  Then he gave a speech at Coachella in front of 125,000 to 150,000 people. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=189.6s)]
*  Let me show you a short clip of Bernie Sanders in Coachella. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=196.6s)]
*  Take a look at this photo of him staring at a crowd of 125,000 to 150,000 people on the main stage. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=198.6s)]
*  Now we got a president of the United States who... [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=206.6s)]
*  I agree. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=213.6s)]
*  Yes, people are livid at the oligarchs at the Trump regime, which has destroyed democracy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=216.6s)]
*  We're past the constitutional crisis phase. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=223.6s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans in the House of Representatives and Senate [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=226.6s)]
*  who gave Donald Trump all of their authority as well. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=231.6s)]
*  Trump is ruling like an authoritarian, like a dictator, a deranged one, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=235.6s)]
*  one that's even weirder and more dangerous than a Kim Jong-un, a pariah state. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=240.6s)]
*  The United States has become alienated and isolated from our allies and the rest of the world [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=244.6s)]
*  who are forming alliances with themselves and leaving the United States and saying, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=250.6s)]
*  What the heck is this mess? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=254.6s)]
*  As Donald Trump puts tariffs on, then exemptions, more tariffs, no tariffs, yes tariffs, no tariffs. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=256.6s)]
*  The insanity, the delusions, the ranting and ravings of a madman. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=262.6s)]
*  This is what Donald Trump was posting yesterday as well. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=268.6s)]
*  Letitia James, this is what Trump posts, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=270.6s)]
*  a totally corrupt politician should resign from her position as New York State Attorney General immediately. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=273.6s)]
*  Everyone is trying to make New York great again and it can never be done with this wacky crook in office. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=279.6s)]
*  And then after that, Donald Trump posts a torture video of people unlawfully being sent to El Salvador, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=286.6s)]
*  migrants who the Trump regime may disappear from the United States without due process [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=293.6s)]
*  through them in concentration camps in El Salvador. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=299.6s)]
*  And now Naid Boukeli, the authoritarian leader of El Salvador, is visiting Donald Trump today and this week. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=302.6s)]
*  And then Donald Trump posts a torture video, an ISIS style torture video being posted by the leader of the United States. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=309.6s)]
*  I wonder why people from other countries are not visiting the United States anymore. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=318.6s)]
*  I wonder why tourism from Canada, Europe, Australia and elsewhere is dropping 30, 50, 75 percent. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=322.6s)]
*  Maybe people don't want to be disappeared to concentration camps and ICE detention centers [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=329.6s)]
*  and then have ISIS style videos made about them and posted by a deranged lunatic leader of the United States. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=334.6s)]
*  Donald Trump posts the following, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=339.6s)]
*  We look forward to seeing President Boukeli of El Salvador tomorrow in the White House, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=341.6s)]
*  is what he posted last night along with this torture video. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=346.6s)]
*  It should be noted that even though the Supreme Court ruled 9-2-0 against Donald Trump [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=349.6s)]
*  in connection with the Abrego Garcia case where Trump disappeared Garcia, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=355.6s)]
*  a El Salvador individual who was living, a migrant who was living in Maryland, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=361.6s)]
*  and he sent him to El Salvador despite the fact that he had protected status and was not giving due process. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=365.6s)]
*  And Trump threw him in a concentration camp and the Supreme Court ordered Abrego Garcia be returned [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=371.6s)]
*  and that Trump facilitate the return. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=376.6s)]
*  On Sunday, Donald Trump filed a paperwork in the federal courts with a declaration and a motion [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=378.6s)]
*  saying that his facilitation is done, that the courts can't dictate what he does. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=385.6s)]
*  He gave him to Boukeli and now it's under the sole custody of Boukeli in El Salvador. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=392.6s)]
*  And Trump says, I'm done. I'm not bringing him back. I'm defying you, Supreme Court. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=398.6s)]
*  I'm defying you, District Court Judge. What are you going to do about it? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=402.6s)]
*  So Trump throwing the United States into both a financial crisis as well as a constitutional crisis all at once [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=406.6s)]
*  and layer in there an international crisis as well. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=413.6s)]
*  As we saw over this weekend on Palm Sunday, what was taking place? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=417.6s)]
*  You had the Putin regime, one of Trump's buddies, the Putin regime bombed Sumi, the city of Sumi in Ukraine, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=422.6s)]
*  two ballistic missiles killing at least 34, injuring 120 innocent Ukrainians. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=432.6s)]
*  And right before that happened, Donald Trump sent his special envoy, Steve Witkop, who put his hand on his heart, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=438.6s)]
*  looked like he was pledging allegiance to Putin. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=445.6s)]
*  Oh, by the way, this was also posted on Donald Trump's social media app as well. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=449.6s)]
*  The Kids' Guide to Doge. Discover for kids how Doge's efforts to cut government waste [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=454.6s)]
*  are paving the way for your children's prosperous future. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=461.6s)]
*  Donald Trump also posted videos of himself golfing, posing in front of gold statues, going to UFC matches, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=464.6s)]
*  other MAGA people over the weekend, the MAGA rappers like Furgatio Blow, whatever this guy is, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=472.6s)]
*  posting videos of himself with stacks of money. Must be great, your stacks of money as people have lost their life savings, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=478.6s)]
*  as their 401Ks are in the gutter, as their college accounts for their kids are in the gutter, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=486.6s)]
*  as homes are less affordable, as the bond market is imploding, as the dollar is crashing, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=491.6s)]
*  you're walking around with stacks of hundred dollar bills. That's what it means to be MAGA today. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=497.6s)]
*  What in the heck is that? So no wonder Republicans fear that Trump's trade wars, tariff policies, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=502.6s)]
*  and overall reckless behavior could cause them a wipeout in the midterm elections. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=508.6s)]
*  This from the Hill. Republicans fear Trump's trade war could lead to political wipeout. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=515.6s)]
*  And remember how it was reported this weekend that the Trump regime was going to provide exemptions to the tariffs [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=521.6s)]
*  as it relates to electronics, laptops, semiconductors, and iPhones? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=529.6s)]
*  Then Trump posts, nobody is getting off the hook for the unfair trade balances and non-monetary tariff barriers [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=534.6s)]
*  that other countries have used against us, especially China. There was no tariff exception on Friday. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=541.6s)]
*  These products are subject to the 20% fentanyl tariffs. So just in case you're losing track, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=548.6s)]
*  there were reciprocal tariffs, but actually not reciprocal tariffs, on everyone but Russia. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=555.6s)]
*  Then the tariffs went down to 10% on everyone but China for 90 days, except actually 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=560.6s)]
*  Then 50% more tariffs on China, then 50% even more tariffs on China, but not computers and electronics, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=568.6s)]
*  but maybe on computers and electronics. Also due to a system glitch, a lot of the tariffs haven't been collected at all. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=574.6s)]
*  Also separate other tariffs on steel pharmaceuticals and semiconductors maybe will be happening. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=579.6s)]
*  Efron wrote a really good one right there. Also there's this post right here of Donald Trump waiting for Xi Jinping to give him a call, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=585.6s)]
*  but Xi Jinping of China is not giving him a call. Also if you go on TikTok, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=591.6s)]
*  you have all of these Chinese influencers who are just mocking the United States and MAGA and Trump's behavior, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=595.6s)]
*  and they're like, oh, you're calling us peasants? Really? You're calling us peasants when we hold your debt? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=601.6s)]
*  I mean, you think about it. China holds what? Close to a trillion dollars in treasury notes of the United States. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=607.6s)]
*  What if they just start dumping those as well and the rest of the world does? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=613.6s)]
*  You know what that's going to do to the bond market here in the United States? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=617.6s)]
*  Do you know what China can actually do based on Trump's reckless handling of this trade war? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=621.6s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about as this GS desk, Pasquarello, a statement goes, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=627.6s)]
*  judging only from price action, we are suddenly witnessing a comprehensive turn away from US assets, stocks, USTs, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=632.6s)]
*  corporate credit, dollars, bonds. The single most theme to monitor over the coming days, weeks and months [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=640.6s)]
*  is that the United States is no longer viewed as a stable economic market. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=646.6s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, you want an update on Doge? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=652.6s)]
*  Elon Musk now says his group will produce only 15% of the savings it promised, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=655.6s)]
*  but even that estimate is inflated with errors and guesswork. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=660.6s)]
*  So at most you're going to be talking about 150 billion in savings, but that's probably all made up too. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=664.6s)]
*  So it's no savings at all. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=670.6s)]
*  Also, if you actually look at the federal spending taking place on the Trump regime, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=672.6s)]
*  where they want to spend $1 trillion on the military industrial complex, Trump said $1 trillion. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=676.6s)]
*  Also, all of this money for Trump's authoritarian machinations and all the terrorizing of immigrants [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=682.6s)]
*  and all these things that Trump's doing there and also Trump's vacations tomorrow. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=689.6s)]
*  There's way more federal spending right now just objectively based on the data than under former President Biden. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=693.6s)]
*  Everything this regime does is an utter failure and an utter mess. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=700.6s)]
*  Let me leave you with this right here. This is Ray Dalio. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=705.6s)]
*  He predicted the Great Recession in 2008. He's a billionaire investor. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=708.6s)]
*  This is not a liberal guy by any stretch of the imagination. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=713.6s)]
*  It's not a lefty by any stretch of the imagination. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=717.6s)]
*  I mean, this is in my view of Ray, he's a right leaning financial guy. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=721.6s)]
*  He goes, I'm worried about something much worse than a recession. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=727.6s)]
*  He's referring to a depression. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=731.6s)]
*  He's saying that Donald Trump is bringing us into a depression right now. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=733.6s)]
*  And if you look at what Trump is doing to the bond markets, if you look at the 5, 10, 20, 30 year Treasury yields right now [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=737.6s)]
*  that are skyrocketing, which they're not supposed to. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=744.6s)]
*  If you look at mortgage rates going up to about 7%, if you look at the fact that the American bond market's imploding, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=748.6s)]
*  the conditions are here. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=755.6s)]
*  The issue is going to be which entity, which institution is going to now default. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=757.6s)]
*  And will that create a domino effect? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=763.6s)]
*  Because that's the type of downward pressures that the Trump regime is putting on the economy here in the United States, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=765.6s)]
*  not just with the tariffs themselves, but with the chaos and the volatility that on the whims of an authoritarian leader in the United States, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=772.6s)]
*  all of a sudden there's fundamental shifts and changes in the economy based on his tweets or social media posts. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=780.6s)]
*  Here's Dalio play this clip. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=786.6s)]
*  I think that right now we are at a decision making point and very close to recession. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=788.6s)]
*  And I'm worried about something worse than a recession if this isn't handled well. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=796.6s)]
*  A recession is two negative quarters of GDP and whether it goes slightly there, we always have those things. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=802.6s)]
*  We have something that's much more profound. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=808.6s)]
*  We have a breaking down of the monetary order. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=811.6s)]
*  We are going to change the monetary order because we cannot spend the amounts of money. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=815.6s)]
*  So we have that problem. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=820.6s)]
*  And when we talk about the dollar and we talk about tariffs, we have that. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=821.6s)]
*  We are having profound changes in our domestic order. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=825.6s)]
*  How ruling is existing. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=830.6s)]
*  And we're having profound changes in the world order. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=832.6s)]
*  Such times are very much like the 1930s. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=835.6s)]
*  I've studied history and this repeats over and over again. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=838.6s)]
*  So if you take tariffs, if you take debt, if you take the rising power, challenging existing power, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=841.6s)]
*  if you take those factors and look at the factors, those changes in the orders, the systems are very, very disruptive. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=848.6s)]
*  How that's handled could produce something that is much worse than a recession. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=857.6s)]
*  Well, there you have it, folks. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=861.6s)]
*  A lot left, a lot of other things to report as well. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=862.6s)]
*  But you do have Republicans worried about the wipeout. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=865.6s)]
*  You do have people standing up in Salt Lake City. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=868.6s)]
*  You have Donald Trump, a deranged lunatic, sexual abuser, sexual predator, felon, fraud, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=870.6s)]
*  engaging in this horrific conduct. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=876.6s)]
*  And then you have the MAGA Republicans basically saying, what can we do? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=878.6s)]
*  He does the art of the deal. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJ1XeNhAmY&t=882.6s)]
