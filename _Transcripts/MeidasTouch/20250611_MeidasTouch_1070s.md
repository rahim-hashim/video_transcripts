# Fox News in PANIC MODE on LIVE TV after Trump DISASTER
**MeidasTouch:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8)
*  State regime media known as Fox, they're in panic mode. I want to show you the anatomy of how they try to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=0.0s)]
*  cover up for Donald Trump, spread disinformation, and how they try to brainwash their audience. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=7.12s)]
*  Let's just go through this together, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=13.22s)]
*  because they went into overdrive for Donald Trump. When Donald Trump had this dementia-like moment, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=15.64s)]
*  and I don't want to let him off the hook by saying, oh, it's just [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=23.5s)]
*  dementia, but Donald Trump had that moment where he was like, I spoke to Gavin Newsom a day ago, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=27.36s)]
*  when they spoke on June 7th. Boom! Fox had to go into overdrive and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=33.92s)]
*  convince their audience that June 9th, a day ago from June 10th, was actually [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=39.36s)]
*  June 7th. Because California Governor Gavin Newsom had said, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=46.64s)]
*  yes, I spoke to Donald Trump on June 7th, and we spoke for about 20 minutes, and Donald Trump didn't talk about the National Guard at all. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=51.72s)]
*  It was really weird. I was speaking to Donald Trump. He wanted to act like he was my buddy. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=59.64s)]
*  He was talking about every topic other than the National Guard, and I was trying to ask him, what the hell's going on? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=63.96s)]
*  He was just talking about other topics. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=69.44s)]
*  So Donald Trump makes up a fake conversation with Newsom, the same way Donald Trump makes up fake everything. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=71.4s)]
*  Oh, I spoke to Xi Jinping, and I told him that it's not humiliating that you're giving me a call, right? Because [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump had to call Xi Jinping. It's just bizarre to lie about literally everything, but [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=83.6s)]
*  State Regime Media Fox, they've got to cover it. So let me just show you the anatomy of all of it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=90.44s)]
*  What are they doing? So [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=95.28s)]
*  State Regime Media Fox, they have Greg Gutfeld, and just look, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=97.32s)]
*  he's like, I don't even know what that little, he has like toys in front of him while he's giving his newscast. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=101.24s)]
*  What the hell's even going on there? And he goes, these are the Biden riots. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=105.84s)]
*  What we're seeing is the Biden riots. And then the Chiron says, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  violent anti-ice rioters cause mayhem in LA. Here, watch this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=115.72000000000001s)]
*  We see why Trump is necessary, because who are the rioters? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=120.36000000000001s)]
*  Remember the tens of thousands of men that float across the border? Almost all entirely men. Where did they go? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=125.84s)]
*  I mean, I guess some were deported, but most of them, they're not deported yet. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  So, I mean, these are the Biden riots. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=135.52s)]
*  And again, in 99% of LA, this is not going on, number one. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=138.0s)]
*  Number two, these were [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  overwhelmingly peaceful protests before Donald Trump [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=147.0s)]
*  escalated this and brought in the National Guard and then the Marines. And Donald Trump tried to provoke this community. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  Ice raids at Home Depots and in factories, in courthouses, by schools, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  going through restaurants, ripping people apart, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=164.36s)]
*  disappearing children like a [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=167.8s)]
*  totalitarian regime, not going after the criminals. We all want to go after the criminals, go after the criminals. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  But they're going after the hard-working migrants who have been here, who pay their taxes, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=175.52s)]
*  who are members of the community. It is absolutely vile. It is absolutely despicable. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=181.24s)]
*  Now, it's the Biden riots during Donald Trump's regime while Donald Trump's in office. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=186.96s)]
*  It's interesting that all of these things happen when Trump's in office, the arsonist, then let me go and fix the problems. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=192.8s)]
*  He creates the trade war. Let me try to solve it. We need to get those rare earth minerals back from China. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=199.56s)]
*  They were coming in until you [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=205.88s)]
*  declared a trade war against the world and put the United States in the weakest position possible. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=208.32s)]
*  Like, you create the problems, then you want to solve your own problems, and you don't do it, and then you want, good job, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=214.48s)]
*  Donald. Let's state regime media. It's just so utterly ridiculous. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=221.92s)]
*  Then you have Jesse Waters playing a clip of Democratic lawmakers saying they stand in solidarity with residents of LA, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=225.92s)]
*  immigrants, and only the peaceful protesters, yet the Chiron reads, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=234.48s)]
*  Dems choose rioters over you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  That's what they're saying. Dems choose rioters over you. I want you to see the brainwashing [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  that's in effect play this clip. Right there says it all. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=248.56s)]
*  So guess what side the Democrats are on? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=252.4s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=255.68s)]
*  Congressional Democrats stand in full solidarity with the residents of Los Angeles, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=257.36s)]
*  with our immigrants, sisters, and brothers, and with the peaceful protesters who dare to speak out [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=263.04s)]
*  and who will support every effort to oppose this president's abuse of power. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=269.76s)]
*  Democrats are telling cops to stand down and rioters to stand up. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=275.2s)]
*  Then Laura Ingraham brings on Kevin McCarthy, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=279.2s)]
*  the completely failed spineless former speaker of the House, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=283.52s)]
*  and their message on Fox to other state regime media, ABC, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=287.68s)]
*  is our message to you, ABC, is you did the right thing by firing Terry Moran, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  who had the audacity of saying that Stephen Miller and Donald Trump have hate in their heart for [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=299.2s)]
*  disappearing four-year-olds and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=305.26s)]
*  taking away mothers who are breastfeeding with their children, ripping them apart. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  How dare you, ABC political correspondent Terry Moran. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  And Fox goes, good work. Pat on the back to our fellow state regime media. Play this clip. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=315.68s)]
*  Now I'm going to do something I haven't done before. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=320.72s)]
*  ABC did the right thing. Good job, ABC. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=322.8s)]
*  You know what? Because this person has probably never even met Stephen Miller. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=327.12s)]
*  And to say that, he's sitting there at midnight putting that out telling exactly what he truly thinks. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=331.44s)]
*  How does he report the news every day? You know what he goes about. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  Taints it, puts it his own beliefs in there. It's something we've been fighting for years. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=340.96s)]
*  And now they finally stood up and said, yes, enough is enough. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=345.52s)]
*  Now we put out a strong message here on the Midas Touch Network to Terry Moran. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=348.8s)]
*  That you've got a place, you've got a home here at the Midas Touch Network if you want. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=353.12s)]
*  Then Laura Ingraham says, I want to remind everyone tonight that if Democrats had their way, they would let this all continue. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=357.91999999999996s)]
*  Hey, Laura. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  Hey, Laura. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=367.36s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=368.64s)]
*  This wasn't happening when Democrats were in charge. This wasn't taking place. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=370.0s)]
*  So you could create your hypothetical dystopian straw man world and attack that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  But this is the Trump regime where guess what's happening, Laura? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=380.8s)]
*  Where prices are up, where there's no peace in Ukraine, where America is weaker and being laughed at by the world, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=384.64s)]
*  where Trump is sending the Marines to attack Americans and people living in American, Laura? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=391.68s)]
*  That's what's going on here. Play this clip. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=397.6s)]
*  I want to remind everyone tonight. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=399.6s)]
*  If Democrats had their way, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=402.56s)]
*  they would let all this continue. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=405.52s)]
*  They wouldn't intervene on the 101, which if you know LA at all, if the 101 is blocked, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=407.68s)]
*  the whole city is strangled. And the surrounding parts of the city, of the main city of the downtown, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=414.96s)]
*  LA County, the ripple effects across the region, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=422.0s)]
*  I can't overstate it enough as someone who's lived in LA. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=426.56s)]
*  More propaganda from Kevin McCarthy. They're sitting there having their American flag saying they want to stay in America. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=430.24s)]
*  They say this is Mexico. They want their land back. They're saying this is Mexico. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=437.76s)]
*  What the hell are you talking about? Play this clip. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=442.32s)]
*  We're in native California. It's getting real there. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=444.32s)]
*  It's getting very real. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  People should listen to what the protesters are saying and they're not protesters, they're rioters. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=450.24s)]
*  And they're not sitting there having American flags saying they want to stay in America. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=455.84s)]
*  They want to become an American. They say this is Mexico. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  They're going to take their land back and they hold Mexican flag. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=462.4s)]
*  Look, starting a new business can be intimidating. I get it. Midas Touch Network was not built overnight. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=465.44s)]

*  protesters. As Carl Keatonia says, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=578.48s)]
*  strange, strangely, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=581.28s)]
*  Roberts doesn't name the democracies that he says, shoot to kill the protesters. That's where Fox is. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=583.36s)]
*  We should be so fortunate that the Trump regime, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=590.5600000000001s)]
*  Gestapo, is not killing the protesters, the peaceful protesters. In other democracies, you would be killed on, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=594.62s)]
*  what the hell are you talking about? Here, play this clip. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=601.44s)]
*  Now, I was just going to say the district attorney for Los Angeles County, Nathan Hockman, who was on Fox and Friends [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=604.1600000000001s)]
*  a little while ago, says he's going to prosecute these folks to the fullest extent of the law. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=608.48s)]
*  But some of these people we see hurling bricks at officers from overpasses. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=612.8000000000001s)]
*  They're throwing them at cars as they're passing by. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=617.6s)]
*  And there are plenty of democratic countries in this world that I can think of where doing something like that, Senator, would get you shot. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=621.12s)]
*  So there would seem to be a fair degree of restraint being practiced by these officers and these National Guard soldiers. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=629.04s)]
*  Well, I don't think we ought to shoot them unless they try to hurt somebody. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=636.64s)]
*  But I think we ought to put them in jail and give them a long time [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=640.88s)]
*  to think about what they did. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  Then next, Jesse Waters plays a clip that's been edited [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=646.64s)]
*  to exclude the part where Donald Trump says he called Newsom a day ago, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=651.36s)]
*  and then shows a Trump call log that Trump gave to John Roberts at Fox, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=656.32s)]
*  showing that he and Donald Trump spoke on Friday. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=662.24s)]
*  And then they go, Newsom's a liar. Why would Newsom lie that they didn't have a phone call? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=666.08s)]
*  Newsom said they didn't have a phone call a day ago, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=671.0400000000001s)]
*  because they didn't have a phone call a day ago. As Brian Tyler Cohen, our friend over here, says, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=674.64s)]
*  So I guess we're going to see a lawsuit against Fox under the Trump precedent of zero tolerance for deceptively edited interviews. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=680.4s)]
*  And this one was actually deceptively edited. Watch this. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=687.6s)]
*  Radical left and it's usually governors that are Democrat [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=710.0s)]
*  and they don't want to call them in. They don't want to [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=714.16s)]
*  save lives. They don't want to save property. They don't want to call them in. I don't know what it is. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=717.04s)]
*  Newsom responded and he said there wasn't a phone call. He said Trump never called him. Not even a voicemail, he said. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=720.96s)]
*  But John Roberts got Trump's call logs and it shows Trump called him late Friday night and they talked for 16 minutes. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=727.84s)]
*  Why would Newsom lie and claim Trump never called him? Why would he do that? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=734.56s)]
*  Because let's take a look at the actual video [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=738.64s)]
*  that Newsom was responding to where Donald Trump said the last time he spoke to Governor Newsom was quote [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=741.6s)]
*  a day ago [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=748.24s)]
*  and I told him you're causing a lot of death. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=749.6s)]
*  Okay, there's been no death so far and you didn't call him a day ago. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=753.2s)]
*  Newsom was called on June 7th. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=759.12s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=762.08s)]
*  you know where there's lots of death that you don't respond to? All of those storms that have hit Kentucky and Mississippi and Missouri and Indiana [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=763.04s)]
*  and Georgia and North Carolina. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=772.7199999999999s)]
*  Across the country dozens of Americans have died. You didn't mention it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=775.12s)]
*  You didn't talk about the four American soldiers who died in Lithuania. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=779.1999999999999s)]
*  Were they suckers and losers Donald to you or the two soldiers who died [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=783.12s)]
*  at the border as you sent our troops to the border by Mexico. Two troops died one person seriously injured. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=788.32s)]
*  You didn't say anything about that. Were they suckers and losers also? How about the fact that the National Guard Donald [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=794.5600000000001s)]
*  was sleeping on the floor in Los Angeles because he didn't give them beds or pillows and they didn't have the resources [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=801.9200000000001s)]
*  to even sleep anywhere. But anyway play this clip. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=808.5600000000001s)]
*  Called him up to tell him got to do a better job. He's doing a bad job [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=818.1600000000001s)]
*  causing a lot of death and a lot of a lot of potential death. If we didn't send out [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=822.32s)]
*  the National Guard and last time we gave a little additional help [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=827.6s)]
*  Los Angeles would be burning right now. Los Angeles would be [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=831.6s)]
*  not a lot different than what you saw take place in [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=837.2s)]
*  California in Los Angeles just a little while ago. So then notice how Donald Trump pivots [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=840.46s)]
*  and he's like I presented the phone call to Fox. I said I spoke to Newsom in the past few days. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=845.92s)]
*  No, you didn't. You said you spoke to him a day ago and in situations [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=851.12s)]
*  actual numbers like the actual facts matter. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=855.84s)]
*  A day ago is not four days ago or three and a half days ago. A day ago is yesterday. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=859.1999999999999s)]
*  So stop with the bullshit play this clip. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=864.4s)]
*  The governor did not speak to you a day ago if you said [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=866.4s)]
*  you know the officer leader. What's your response? Well, I gave him it wasn't a day ago. It's a little longer than that. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=871.28s)]
*  And I presented the phone conversation to [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=877.04s)]
*  Fox News. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=881.04s)]
*  John Roberts and Molly Lyne at Fox News because they were the ones that said it. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=882.64s)]
*  And we actually spent 16 point something minutes on the phone [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=888.3199999999999s)]
*  and I told him he's got to get his act together because you're gonna have some bad times in Los Angeles if he doesn't. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=892.64s)]
*  We had a pleasant conversation. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=898.96s)]
*  The proof was from the phone company. Because here is from a few days ago [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=901.2800000000001s)]
*  where Governor Newsom voluntarily said I spoke with Trump for about 20 minutes. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=907.36s)]
*  He never brought up the National Guard. Watch this. Just 10 minutes ago [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=912.0s)]
*  he put out another truth social telling you and the mayor to apologize to the people of Los Angeles. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=915.6s)]
*  You guys go at it pretty hard publicly, but I know you talk privately. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=921.0400000000001s)]
*  Have you spoken in the last couple of days to the president about any of this? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=924.48s)]
*  Yeah, we know. We talked for almost 20 minutes and barely this issue never came up. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=927.6s)]
*  I kept trying to talk about LA. He wanted to talk about all these other issues. We had a very decent conversation. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=933.2800000000001s)]
*  When was this? This was late Friday night. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=937.76s)]
*  About 1 30 plus his time. After the protests had started. After the protests and he never once brought up the National Guard. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=940.08s)]
*  He's a stone cold liar. He said he did. Stone cold liar. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=945.52s)]
*  Never did. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=949.84s)]
*  It was a very civil conversation. I've always wanted to approach engagement with the president of the United States in a respectful and responsible way. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=951.04s)]
*  But there's no working with the president. There's only working for him and I will never work for Donald Trump. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=959.2s)]
*  And so now you have all of the MAGA disinformation [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=964.96s)]
*  influencers like Eric Doughty goes breaking. New phone logs dispute. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=969.82s)]
*  Gavin Newsom's lie that President Trump never called him. This was obtained by John Roberts at Fox. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=974.24s)]
*  Directly from President Trump's phone. There was no call. Not even a voicemail Newsom says. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=980.56s)]
*  The log shows the date and time. The log shows June 7th, 2025. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=986.24s)]
*  That's what it shows. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=993.8399999999999s)]
*  Multiple days ago. Not a day ago. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=995.92s)]
*  And then John Roberts has to then basically sit like notice how John Roberts then from Fox then pivots his language. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=998.72s)]
*  And he's like and Donald Trump said a day ago or a few days ago. No, he said a day ago. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=1006.08s)]
*  Stop bending. This is what I've always said. I go if Donald Trump says the sky is pink. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=1010.5600000000001s)]
*  They'll go the sky is actually pink today. This makeup stuff. Here's John Roberts play this clip. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=1016.5600000000001s)]
*  Uh, Gavin Newsom after President Trump said in the noon hour in the Oval Office that he called him yesterday the other day. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=1021.2s)]
*  Gavin Newsom tweeted the following. He said quote there was no call. And I think California Governor Gavin Newsom has been showing such incredible leadership. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=1028.0s)]
*  And his press office responds to uh, because in Trump's phone it says Newsom. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=1035.76s)]
*  And then Governor Newsom goes thought it was Newscum, Mr. President. Oh, and by the way, this calls from three days ago. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiqw2SW66O8&t=1041.12s)]
