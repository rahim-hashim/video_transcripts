# Trump gets CRUSHED in AM with AWFUL News and LOSES IT
**MeidasTouch:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE)
*  Another morning of panicking and ranting and raving by Donald Trump. Here's what he just posted. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=0.0s)]
*  Our court system is not letting me do the job I was elected to do. Activist judges must let the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=5.84s)]
*  Trump administration deport murderers and other criminals who have come into our country illegally [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=11.76s)]
*  without delay! It should be noted, Donald, that your Attorney General Pam Bondi yesterday gave [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=18.56s)]
*  a press conference where she said that she wanted the worst of the worst murderers and criminals [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  to be prosecuted and put in American jails. But, Donald, there's something called due process in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=29.36s)]
*  our country, and you're deporting and disappearing people without criminal history to concentration [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=34.96s)]
*  camps. And Trump-appointed judges in multiple states now have joined with judges appointed [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=40.32s)]
*  by Democratic administrations, and they've all held, every single one of them held, that there's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  something called due process in the United States of America. You present the evidence, you prove [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=52.4s)]
*  your case, if you prove people are guilty, they can go to jail and they could be deported. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=57.68s)]
*  That's our system, Donald. You don't like our system, go to Russia. We know that's where you [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  want to go anyway. With posts like this, we know that's where you want to be. You hate the free [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=66.4s)]
*  press, you hate our Constitution. Donald Trump whining this morning about 60 minutes again and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=70.64s)]
*  about CVS, and Trump trying to shake down Paramount and trying to block the merger between Paramount [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=77.04s)]
*  and Skydance by attacking them through this $20 billion ridiculous lawsuit that Trump filed [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=84.16s)]
*  against 60 Minutes because he didn't like the way they did an interview with former Vice President [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=92.16s)]
*  Kamala Harris in October of 2024 before the November election that Donald Trump was too [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  afraid to sit for himself. Trump writes, the election interfering 60 Minutes interview with [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=102.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris. Just pause there for a second, Donald. It's May 7th, 2025. Americans are suffering [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=109.04s)]
*  right now, okay? Main Street is suffering. Your trade war against the world has created [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  massive uncertainty. People are being laid off. People are seeing the impacts in our economy while [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  you're pretending everything is great. And on May 7th, 2025, you're waking up. This is what you're [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=128.0s)]
*  posting about? This is what you think leadership is? Like, could we just talk about right and wrong [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=133.84s)]
*  for a second, people? We don't need to talk about Democrat, Republican, independents. What the hell [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=139.12s)]
*  is this? I don't know how anyone looks at this, goes, oh, the election interfering. Oh, he makes [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=143.2s)]
*  a good point. What are you even doing? No deals, Donald. The election interfering 60 Minutes [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=147.68s)]
*  interview with Kamala Harris, which aired on CBS just before election day and deep into early voting, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=153.52s)]
*  turned out to be much worse than expected. Did 60 Minutes and its corporate parents apply to get [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=159.28s)]
*  an Emmy for an illegally falsified interview, or did other fake outlets nominate them for this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=168.0s)]
*  dubious honor? These antics are why the American people have no trust in the press. What the hell [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=174.48s)]
*  are you even writing about? You promised there would be peace in Ukraine in 24 hours, a lie. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=181.12s)]
*  You promised you would bring peace to Gaza in 24 hours, a lie. And now Israel is saying that they [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  plan to fully occupy it forever and remove everybody from Gaza. That's what they're saying they're [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=193.52s)]
*  going to do. In addition, a war just broke out between India and Pakistan, and you're posting [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=198.96s)]
*  this? Oh, and you're also, again, promoting your meme coins, the Trump meme coins, where the top [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=207.12s)]
*  22 holders of your meme coins get to meet with you for an exclusive dinner in Washington, D.C. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=214.8s)]
*  on May 22nd, 2025. And now we know that the Abu Dhabi fund, by the way, Trump's going to the Middle [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=222.8s)]
*  East next week, the Abu Dhabi funds using $2 billion in Trump crypto for transactions. So the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=228.8s)]
*  transaction fee will ignore to the benefit of Donald Trump and his family. Personally, we have [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=235.52s)]
*  Donald Trump building resorts in Qatar right now, Donald Trump building resorts in Oman with [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=241.04s)]
*  Saudi Arabia right now. I mean, the corruption is right in front of our faces. And look, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=246.4s)]
*  should we talk about the insanity of Donald Trump posting AI images of himself as the pope and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=252.0s)]
*  offending the Catholic community right before they go into their conclave? Should we talk about that? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=257.84s)]
*  Yes, it's deeply offensive and despicable. Donald Trump wanting to open up, reopen Alcatraz. Yes, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=262.88s)]
*  but let's not forget about the billions and tens of billions of dollars in corruption [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=269.36s)]
*  right before our face with Donald Trump and his crime family. Then Donald Trump posts, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  Lawrence Jones is doing a great job on Fox and Friends. What do you just watch TV all day? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=281.44s)]
*  You watch TV. I mean, again, imagine if you had someone who worked at your company, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  a boss, whoever at a company at a midsize, big size, small size company, non-profit, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  whatever, who behaved this way, you would say this is absolutely despicable. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=297.44s)]
*  Are we any closer to having peace in Ukraine? A statement from JD Vance this morning, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=301.68s)]
*  There is a big gulf between where Ukrainians and Russians are. U.S. Vice President Vance says, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=307.2s)]
*  We think Russians are asking for too much. Vance also says, It is probably impossible to mediate [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=313.6s)]
*  this without at least some direct negotiation between Russia and Ukraine. I'm glad on May 7th, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=320.0s)]
*  2025, after making a fundamental promise of your campaign that you were going to bring [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=327.2s)]
*  peace to Ukraine in 24 hours, you go, it's probably impossible without direct negotiations. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=332.08s)]
*  You mean between Russia, which wants to exterminate Ukraine, which invaded Ukraine, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=338.16s)]
*  and Ukraine, which has agreed and wants there to be a ceasefire without any conditions at all? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, Europe realizes what a loser Donald Trump is. The world realizes what a loser Donald Trump [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=351.2s)]
*  is. And as Donald Trump makes the world weaker, Europe, Canada, Australia, other places are saying, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=357.6s)]
*  Okay, we got this. We know. Okay, Donald, you want to post about 60 minutes and how that makes you [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=365.04s)]
*  upset? Was 60 minutes mean to you, Donald? Okay, we're going to pursue intelligent fiscal policy. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=371.36s)]
*  We're going to handle central banking the way it should be handled. We're going to build alliances [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=379.52s)]
*  the way they should be built. The European Commission will announce on Thursday details of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  its plan for countermeasures against US tariffs should negotiations with Washington fail, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  European Trade Commissioner Maro Sveco said on Wednesday. Also, you remember yesterday how [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that he would be meeting with Chinese trade representatives [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  in Switzerland in the coming days, manipulates the market moves the market. It's the China play, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=408.48s)]
*  like our markets right now are moving on the idea that the Trump administration is going to remove [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=415.76s)]
*  the tariffs on China. That's where we are that we are going to that the markets while former [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=422.72s)]
*  President Biden pursued smart, intelligent fiscal policy created 16.2 million jobs in our economy, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=429.76s)]
*  record low unemployment, 40,000 infrastructure projects going up and they were they were brutal [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=436.0s)]
*  to former President Biden. They treat Donald Trump removing the problems he created as somehow being [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=443.2s)]
*  a win and on that basis, the market is being manipulated based on the ideas that there may [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=450.96s)]
*  be some sort of a deal with China in the horizon to remove the tariffs, not some comprehensive [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=456.32s)]
*  trade deal, but just to undo the damage that Donald Trump has done in this embargo. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=463.12s)]
*  The weather is heating up and your nighttime bedroom temperature has a huge impact on your [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=467.52s)]
*  sleep quality. If you wake up too hot or too cold, I highly recommend that you check out [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=471.76s)]

*  is saying, is he trying to downplay the expectations after he moved the market? Now [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=589.68s)]
*  he downplays the expectations. Just the beginning of conversations. We'll see where it goes. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=594.48s)]
*  Okay, well now used car prices are going up, reflecting broad inflationary impacts from tariffs [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=599.92s)]
*  up 4.9% year over year in April, the biggest jump since August of 2022. So inflation is back. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=606.7199999999999s)]
*  You know that even though Donald Trump's claiming, oh, like a miracle, it all went away. We know that [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  it's here. And then the cruelty of his policies are seeping into a lot of other things as well. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=618.8s)]
*  Take for example, this bulletin that Cornell University put out. Approximately 40,000 children [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=624.4s)]
*  born every year have some type of heart condition, but that isn't a large enough number to incentivize [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=630.72s)]
*  the private sector medical device companies to invest. For that reason, the only option for [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=637.36s)]
*  federal funding. And one of the issues here is based on the Trump stop work order for federal [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=645.92s)]
*  government. The project's future is uncertain. So on a lab bench in the basement of Wheel Hall, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=652.32s)]
*  a tiny device silently plumps fluid through a series of tubes and vessels that mimic the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  human heart. It has the potential to save lives, lives of tens of thousands of babies with heart [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=663.9200000000001s)]
*  defects. But the oligarch say, screw that. I always want to highlight those little pieces [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=670.08s)]
*  in a given day too, because with all of the Trump chaos, let's not forget the cruelty is the point. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=675.36s)]
*  Speaking of cruelty being the point, JD Vance yesterday at this press conference that he was [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=681.68s)]
*  having with Donald Trump while India attacked Pakistan and they were at war with each other. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=688.48s)]
*  JD Vance joked about deporting tourists who attend the 2026 World Cup. He warned people that if you [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=695.28s)]
*  stay a little bit later than you should, after you attend the World Cup, that dog killer Homeland [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=702.8s)]
*  Security Secretary Kristi Noem will throw you into concentration camps. So funny. I'm sure people [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=707.92s)]
*  who have legitimate fears about coming into the United States because the United States is [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=714.8s)]
*  literally disappearing human beings to concentration camps in El Salvador and showing ISIS style videos [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=719.68s)]
*  about it. I'm sure that's going to encourage tourism, you moron. JD, these people are [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=726.16s)]
*  cruel and they are morons. It's just that simple. The US in February made just $4.3 billion [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=733.6800000000001s)]
*  in new binding funding commitments to state and local governments, a 57.5% decline from the same [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=742.32s)]
*  month a year earlier. We also learned that more than a half of the top holders of Donald Trump's [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=749.76s)]
*  meme coin who are jockeying for that dinner with Donald Trump that he was posting about today [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=756.0s)]
*  have used foreign exchanges that say they ban US users, suggesting that many of the purchasers [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=761.2s)]
*  are based outside of the US. Speaking by the way of what else is going on outside of the US, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=767.92s)]
*  Denmark inviting American scientists to continue their research in their country. We're seeing [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=777.28s)]
*  this all throughout Europe. We're seeing this in Australia. We're seeing this in China. We're [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=783.6s)]
*  seeing this in Asia. We're seeing them saying, look, US scientists will offer you funds and [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=789.04s)]
*  stipends. Come over here, brain drain. Let's get rid of the best and brightest from the United [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  States. Come to Denmark, come to Europe, come to France. And they're offering incentives to do that. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=799.8399999999999s)]
*  Come to Canada. And we're seeing our scientists do that. They go, why would we go here where we're [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  going to be attacked by the Trump regime for doing scientific research? Are we going to get thrown in [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=810.56s)]
*  jail? Is he going to throw the DOJ at us? Is he going to shut us down? No, we need to be able to [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=817.36s)]
*  do our job, do our profession, be scientists in a place that actually supports science. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=822.88s)]
*  I want to leave you with this story because it's so incredibly bizarre, but it's one of these things [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=829.2s)]
*  that are not getting reported enough. Let's just go into the reporting inside Sweden itself in [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=833.92s)]
*  Stockholm and take a look at what their local paper is reporting. This is front page news right now in [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=840.08s)]
*  Sweden. I know we have a lot of supporters from Sweden who are part of the Midas Mighty. The US [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=846.0s)]
*  embassy in Sweden sent a contract to Stockholm's urban planning office demanding the elimination [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=851.84s)]
*  of equality, diversity and inclusion policies and demanded they sign it. It's completely bizarre, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=859.6s)]
*  a Stockholm urban planning counselor, Jean Valskog said. It's the most bizarre thing. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=866.96s)]
*  The United States, through its embassy, is acting like it controls Stockholm, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=873.4399999999999s)]
*  that it controls Sweden, and it is telling the people of Sweden, you can't have diversity, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=879.52s)]
*  equity and inclusion in Sweden. Our embassy, you heard that right, the US embassy sending contracts [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=885.4399999999999s)]
*  to government officials in Sweden and foreign countries saying, you must agree to remove your [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=892.0s)]
*  DEI if you want the United States embassy to be here. And the people are outraged there. And I [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=897.36s)]
*  think the United States is now going to be doing this in other nations as well. I think they have [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=903.6s)]
*  before. It's wild stuff that that's what they're doing. This is the Trump regime. It's buffoonish, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=908.24s)]
*  it's clownish, no offense to clowns, but it's another day in the Trump regime. Tell me what [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=914.24s)]
*  you think. Leave comments below. What's up to all of our Sweden fans? Great to have you watch. I got [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5V6Tm3YwE&t=918.48s)]
