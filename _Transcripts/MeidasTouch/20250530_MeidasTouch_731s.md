# Republicans RETURN HOME and get INSTANTLY BOOED to FACES
**MeidasTouch:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4)
*  We saw Republican Congress members going back to the state of Colorado, I guess, to lie [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=0.0s)]
*  to the people of Colorado about what was in that disastrous budget bill. But the people of Colorado [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=7.04s)]
*  were not buying it. And they were booing them at these manufactured press conference on the steps [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=11.84s)]
*  of the Colorado state Capitol. Exhibit A, MAGA Republican Congress member Gabe Evans, pretending [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=16.8s)]
*  that this disastrous budget bill actually protects Medicaid when it does the exact opposite. Here, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=22.48s)]
*  play the clip. It's about protecting Medicaid. It literally cuts close to a trillion dollars, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=27.76s)]
*  880 billion dollars. What are they talking about? Here's MAGA Republican Congresswoman [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  Lauren Boebert. Play this clip. It's in the big, beautiful bill. They keep calling that. It's a [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=51.92s)]
*  big, giant disaster. I'll show you one more clip of some of these people just not buying it. Let's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=78.96s)]
*  play it. We're seeing headlines like this throughout Colorado. Colorado businesses struggle [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=83.36s)]
*  amid uncertain teams of Trump's fluctuating tariffs. Colorado would lose billions of dollars [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=108.72s)]
*  in Medicaid funding under this disastrous bill. Colorado is going to lose a lot of clean energy [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=114.32s)]
*  programs that bring jobs to the state. Who better to talk about what's going on in the state of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=120.08s)]
*  Colorado than Colorado Governor Jared Polis? Governor Polis, great to have you on. What do [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=125.76s)]
*  you think when you see these Republicans coming back from Washington and saying that this big [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=131.68s)]
*  budget disaster bill actually protects Medicaid? What's your response to that? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=137.04s)]
*  Well, frankly, this is really the first Coloradans have seen of Gabe Evans. He's been hiding zero [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  town halls. People have been having cut out photos of him at town halls trying to get his ear in his [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=146.64s)]
*  district, which is right near Denver. He won by just a couple thousand votes. He's very vulnerable, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=152.32s)]
*  but this is the first they saw of him. The reception wasn't good because there he is defending [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  an incredibly unpopular bill that would throw hundreds of thousands of Coloradans off of their [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=163.36s)]
*  healthcare and, frankly, raise commercial insurance rates for everybody else. Because when you throw [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  that many people off of healthcare, there's cost shifting that occurs, and you're going to see 15 [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=173.68s)]
*  to 20% increases or even more on everyone's insurance premiums that they buy commercial [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=178.88000000000002s)]
*  insurance with. People are really outraged with this, and this is the first they saw of him. I [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=184.16000000000003s)]
*  wasn't any surprised to see that he got that kind of reception right near his district. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=189.52s)]
*  I know when you're looking at that budget bill, you're looking out for your state. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=194.72s)]
*  You're taking a look at, okay, how is this impacting Medicaid and how many people are on [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  Medicaid in the state? How is this impacting SNAP? How is this impacting the infrastructure projects [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=204.08s)]
*  that are going on across? How is this impacting making housing more affordable? What's your [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=209.68s)]
*  just overall assessment? Are there certain areas that concern you more than others? What do you [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=216.64s)]
*  say to the people of Colorado as this works its way to the Senate? Well, it's a very devious plot [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=223.2s)]
*  because the federal government is cutting back on Medicaid, and they're letting the states be the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  bad guys. They're saying, you guys decide exactly who to throw off, what benefits to cut. To be [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=233.2s)]
*  clear, I can certainly speak for Colorado. I'm almost certain it's the case for every state. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=238.64s)]
*  The states don't have the ability to backfill this Medicaid money. It's a question of who will [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=243.76s)]
*  lose their health care and what benefits will be cut. Those are terrible decisions to foist them [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  on the states. Again, no matter what the states decide, it's going to increase everyone else's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=255.28s)]
*  insurance. This big, beautiful bill is really blowing up right in the face of Gabe Evans, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=260.08s)]
*  right in the face of the president. There's still time to fix it. I hope the Senate does [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=264.88s)]
*  because real people are hurt when they lose health care. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=268.88s)]
*  It seems what the Trump administration uses the federal government for is to kind of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=272.0s)]
*  attack the freedoms within the state's rights and the ability of the state to protect its people's [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=279.36s)]
*  freedoms. But then also when it comes to the resources, limit the purpose of what the federal [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=284.88s)]
*  government is actually there for, being this important backstop on all of these issues, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=292.32s)]
*  whether it is something like Medicaid or whether it is something like in the Department of Education [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=299.52s)]
*  and ensuring that there are lunches for kids with disabilities or kids who are poor and rely on it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=305.52s)]
*  It's cruel. It feels very cruel. How do you see it? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=315.2s)]
*  Colorado already is a state. For every dollar we pay to the federal government, we only get [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  90 cents back. This only makes it worse. They're using more and more for debt service. This [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  budget plan increases the deficit more than any other budget plan in the history of our country, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=329.68s)]
*  blows the roof off the deficit. Even Elon Musk criticized the fact that it increases spending [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=334.32s)]
*  and decreases revenue. What does that equate to? Record deficits, record debt. More and more of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=339.44s)]
*  Colorado's tax dollars and your tax dollars are just going to go to servicing the debt [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=346.16s)]
*  rather than help people with health care, help kids in our schools, or help build roads. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's what people want their taxes to go to. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  And let's talk about DOGE because I think in theory, people want the government to be more [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=359.92s)]
*  efficient. We want to rein in bad spending. But in my view, DOGE has been an absolute failure. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=365.36s)]
*  There's actually more federal spending. And now with this budget, the deficit's going to increase [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=372.4s)]
*  by trillions. And then there is the direct attacks on states and things that people don't really [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=377.52s)]
*  necessarily even think about outside of the state. But talk to us about how DOGE has harmed [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  Colorado, including in areas like forest services and wildfire prevention and things like that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=390.96s)]
*  First of all, as you pointed out, if the goal was to reduce the deficit and cut spending, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=397.35999999999996s)]
*  it didn't work. There's record spending. It's a spending spree, defense, border security, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=401.2s)]
*  all the things that are in that bill, record amounts while they're cutting back in areas [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=406.88s)]
*  that matter and reducing revenue. Look, we all hope that DOGE would find major waste and fraud [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=411.68s)]
*  and result in savings to their credit. They found a little, but in fact, it's dwarfed by this huge [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=420.0s)]
*  deficit spending plan. So it really was all for naught if they're just going to spend, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=426.16s)]
*  you know, 10 times even what they what they saved through that work. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=430.64000000000004s)]
*  Talk to us about your budget and contrast it with what we're seeing now and the types of priorities [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=434.56s)]
*  that as a Democratic governor, you're focused on versus it seems when it comes to the federal [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=443.12s)]
*  budget, it has a lot to do with harming people, taking away, you know, things that are essential [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=450.16s)]
*  services. Can you as a Democratic governor have a budget that helps people and is also fiscally [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=457.20000000000005s)]
*  responsible? And first of all, we balance our budget. It's a requirement in Colorado. I think [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  it's a requirement in nearly every or every state to produce a balanced budget. The federal [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=470.8s)]
*  government is going to have record deficits with this plan that's making its way through [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=475.68s)]
*  Congress. We put people first in ours. First thing we do, fund our schools. We have full funding of [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=480.96s)]
*  our schools, reducing class size. We increase the budget per student by about 400 and some dollars. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=487.04s)]
*  You know, for a class of 20, that's a good $8,000, $9,000 increase for next year. We made college [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=492.64s)]
*  more affordable. We did a now if you make under $90,000 the first two years of college, community [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=498.96000000000004s)]
*  college are free in the great state of Colorado. We established free preschool and kindergarten. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=503.92s)]
*  When I became governor, that's one of the reasons I ran. We only had half day kindergarten. Parents [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  had to pay for full day preschool. You had to pay for $6,000 a year plus free now saving families [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=512.32s)]
*  of four year olds, five year olds, thousands of dollars a year. And more importantly, making sure [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=519.04s)]
*  that every kid, no matter their economic background, gets a strong start in learning and achievement [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=523.28s)]
*  and is able to perform a grade level. So this is the way that we've done it. We've done it every [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=528.48s)]
*  year with a balanced budget. Governor, are there any issues? It's a bit of a broad question, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=532.24s)]
*  but whenever I have a governor on, you have a perspective that I, as a reporter in an interview, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=538.08s)]
*  don't. So are there any issues that you think deserve more attention that you're focused on, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=544.16s)]
*  on a day to day that, you know, I always think that sometimes the most important issues are the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=549.92s)]
*  ones that are not being discussed. And so are there issues in your state or just in general [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=555.04s)]
*  that concern you that you're focused on that you want to see more attention be spent on? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=560.56s)]
*  I'll raise two exciting things we're working on in Colorado and in many states like Colorado, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=565.04s)]
*  where it's desirable to live, good job market, people want to come here, our housing prices have [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=570.16s)]
*  gone up. And so there's been artificial constraints on supply. We focus on making it easier to build [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=575.1999999999999s)]
*  homes, eliminating parking requirements, allowing accessory dwelling units to be built by right, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=581.04s)]
*  establishing multifamily zoning in near transit areas in our cities. We reformed stair evacuations [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=587.84s)]
*  to allow for more architectural flexibility. So everything we're doing to help reduce the cost of [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=595.6800000000001s)]
*  housing, make living in our state more affordable. The second area, which is very exciting, is what I [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=600.08s)]
*  would put in the kind of the realm of workforce innovations. How do we better prepare learners, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=605.12s)]
*  and we mean students 16, 17, 18, but also could be a 30 year old coming back to learn new career, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=609.44s)]
*  learners of all ages, how do we successfully prepare them for good careers that earn a good [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=614.64s)]
*  living with meaningful certification that means something to employers, right? So it's well beyond [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  just, oh, you're it's college for four years or two years. There's many kinds of certificates, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=624.16s)]
*  whether it's a trade like welding, whether it's a nurse, anesthetist, nurse assistant, how do we get [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=628.16s)]
*  people trained up to live their potential, earn a good living, and also help power our state and our [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=633.76s)]
*  country forward. And we're doing a lot in that area from apprenticeships to free training to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=639.2s)]
*  making sure that students who graduate high school have the opportunity and exposure, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=644.08s)]
*  especially if they're not going on to a four year university, to get a certification as they graduate [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=647.6s)]
*  that allows them to get a good job. Finally, this budget is working its way through the Senate right [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=652.32s)]
*  now as a leader outside of Washington, the governor of the great state of Colorado. What would be your [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YozAR8jiu4&t=657.84s)]
