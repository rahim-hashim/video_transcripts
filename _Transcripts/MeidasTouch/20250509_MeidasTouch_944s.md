# Newsom DROPS THE HAMMER on Trump on HIS OWN TURF
**MeidasTouch:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA)
*  I'm joined by California's Governor Gavin Newsom. Governor, you are taking the fight against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's disastrous economic policy to Trump's turf on Fox News. Tell us about what [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  you're doing, Governor. Well, it's getting really serious, and I don't think people fully have [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=12.24s)]
*  absorbed how serious. We're talking about school supplies not being on the shelves when kids come [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=17.12s)]
*  back from the summer. We're talking about just a few months away from having a real impact, quite [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  literally, on toys being on people's shelves. We're seeing 60 percent, six zero percent decline in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=27.2s)]
*  bookings for cargo, and California is the recipient of 40 percent of the good movement coming into the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=35.04s)]
*  United States and Long Beach and L.A. So this is serious stuff. It's code red now. It's not just a [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=41.92s)]
*  yellow flag, and that's why we wanted to take this ad directly to Trump, knowing that he'll be watching [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=47.36s)]
*  Fox and have plenty of opportunities to understand and absorb the impacts. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=53.04s)]
*  But Governor, Donald Trump's saying that if you're a little girl, you just gotta be fine. You get one [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=59.92s)]
*  doll, you get one pencil, you're gonna pay more for it, and just shut up. I mean, that's what he's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=64.96s)]
*  saying. What do you think about that? Well, you imagine if Joe Biden said something like that, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=71.52s)]
*  that the prime time lineup at Fox would be reacting to that, how it would light up every one of the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=76.64s)]
*  right-wing networks. I mean, it's real. This is serious. And what happened yesterday was [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=82.16s)]
*  not very serious, and that was this so-called deal with the UK that actually hurts American [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=90.88s)]
*  automobile manufacturers. Don't take my word for it. You saw GM and others came out with a statement [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=98.08s)]
*  saying this advantages imports of Range Rovers and Rolls Royces over American manufacturers. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=103.76s)]
*  So it's time to sober up, and it's time for this administration to sober up. They have done real [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  damage, and they cannot quickly undo that damage. And it's time to highlight the consequences. We [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  obviously filed the lawsuit, but I think now as consumers, we need to understand what Trump has [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=123.68s)]
*  done and the impacts, even if he reversed course tomorrow, the impacts of that over the course of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=130.56s)]
*  the next few months. What do you think they should do? I mean, obviously, this UK deal, to your point, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=135.68s)]
*  the auto manufacturers saying it's a disaster. I mean, they did this trade war against the world [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=142.72s)]
*  right now, and they seem to be a total mess. And I don't even know what they're... They think tariffs [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=149.84s)]
*  are great. They want to remove the... I don't even know what they're doing. What are they doing? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=156.24s)]
*  Yeah, look, if you use their theory of the case, if you want to impose tariffs to bring back [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=159.92s)]
*  manufacturing, industrial policy back to the United States of America, they have to be predictable. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=167.2s)]
*  You have to have stability. You have to send a signal to small business owners that this is here [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  to stay, and that means you have to radically change the way you're doing business. But every [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  few hours, every news cycle, there's another zig and zag. It's chaotic. There's no rhyme or reason. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=184.16s)]
*  I'll give you a specific example just this morning. In anticipation of meeting with Chinese [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=192.16s)]
*  counterparts in Geneva, he decided to negotiate against himself, the great negotiator, from 145% [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=198.32s)]
*  tariffs imposed on China. Now he says, well, maybe it should be 80%. Who knows what happens [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  in the next few hours? And if you're someone that's buying goods from overseas, from China, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=210.64s)]
*  how do you make a decision? Maybe you wait another week, maybe another month, and see if it gets down [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=216.32s)]
*  to 10% like it is in the UK. It's an absurd, absurd rollout, and it's profoundly impactful. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=221.27999999999997s)]
*  He's wrecking the economy of the United States and California as the tempo of the economy is being [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=228.48s)]
*  impacted more than anybody else. Going back to this ad buy that you're doing on Fox, let me just [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  show our viewers the ad, then let's talk about it. Let's play it. California is now the fourth [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=239.2s)]
*  largest economy in the world. Innovation, manufacturing, agriculture, and we've done it [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  by reducing trade barriers and delivering for American consumers. But the Trump administration [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=249.04s)]
*  is putting all of that at risk, halting delivery of essential goods through our ports. Today, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  it's school backpacks. In a few months, it'll be Christmas toys. These tariffs punish families [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=259.36s)]
*  and risk ending America's run as the world's greatest economy. Take it from California. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=265.2s)]
*  We're the ones leading it. Governor, how serious is this scarcity issue? I don't want to fearmonger [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=270.8s)]
*  my audience and say there's not going to be things on the shelves, but I'm hearing from [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  the Long Beach port director, the Seattle port director, that ships aren't coming in, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=283.76s)]
*  at least at the quantity they should be. What's really happening? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=289.68s)]
*  No, it's very real. It's very raw. I was walking with some of the dock workers and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  some meeting with truckers just in Oakland, California, the northern part of California, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=298.64s)]
*  that's down 20%. Down 35% in Southern California. Bookings moving forward down 60%. It takes days [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=302.88s)]
*  and days and days. It takes weeks and weeks and weeks for decisions being made overseas and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=310.56s)]
*  purchase orders to go into effect before they end up on the shelves. So decisions that are being [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  made today or the indecision around making commitments will have a profound impact on [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  tomorrow. And that's why this can't be easily fixed. I think Trump's in a bit of a panic. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=326.79999999999995s)]
*  He recognizes the damage now he's done. I think he's trying to reconcile that with the markets, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  but there's something now bigger than the markets around consumer confidence. It's around investments [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=336.4s)]
*  and business decisions that are being made and the impact that's going to have over the course of the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  next many months, including, and yes, I'll highlight because I have kids, and forgive me, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=346.16s)]
*  I'll double down again on school supplies, on issues around toys, or 80 plus percent of our [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  toys, things under your Christmas tree, come from China. And so it's not about fear-mongering. It's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  about, I think, waking people up that this has already had a profound impact on the United States [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  of America and our economy and budgets, including the budget of the state of California. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=371.84s)]
*  When Donald Trump panics, he tries to buy time. And often that's through [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=376.32s)]
*  efforts to distract and deflect. I don't want to fall into his distraction trap where he talks [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=380.64s)]
*  about Alcatraz this, Alcatraz that, but I think it's important to call it out for what it is, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=388.23999999999995s)]
*  which is look there, distraction, while what's his next trip? He's going to the Middle East to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=394.88s)]
*  meet with sovereign wealth funds that he has deals with in Qatar, in Oman, with the Abu Dhabi [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=400.48s)]
*  fund for his crypto. It's kind of look there, here's what I'm doing. What do you think about it? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=406.88s)]
*  Well, I could not agree. I think this is the essential question that we have to answer as [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=411.6s)]
*  Democrats and how we address and deal with Trump and this wrecking ball of policy making, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=417.6s)]
*  particularly as it relates to terrorists. We have got to focus on the big thing that impacts us in [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=423.6s)]
*  more ways on more days. And that's the issue of these tariffs. That's why we did first state [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=428.48s)]
*  lawsuit against these tariffs. He does not have the unilateral right to impose tariffs, period, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=433.68s)]
*  full stop. And that's why I'm doing this ad to maintain that focus and not get to your point [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=440.0s)]
*  distracted by distraction day on Sunday, just a few days ago, where it wasn't just Alcatraz. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=445.52000000000004s)]
*  He was talking about tariffs on foreign films or films that are made overseas. And we all ran, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=451.44s)]
*  we all chased that. And meanwhile, what's staring us in the face is hundreds and hundreds, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=458.32s)]
*  thousands and thousands will be tens of thousands containers less of goods coming into our ports, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=464.32s)]
*  ending up on our shelves and impact that will have on our quality of life. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  Let's talk about California facts.com. Why you've launched it. I mean, I saw kind of first hand you [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=474.24s)]
*  dealing with the deluge of lies as you were trying to deal here, where I live in Southern [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=482.32s)]
*  California with the disastrous fires at the beginning of the year, while you were out there, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=487.52s)]
*  sleeves rolled up literally on the front lines, ordering the trucks and the fire department here. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=492.32s)]
*  They were lying about you relentlessly. And, you know, I think even I could be wrong here. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  I even think that you were slightly for that first day caught off guard a little bit that they would [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=503.92s)]
*  go after you right then and there where you were in the thick of it. And then to me, there was a [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=508.88s)]
*  moment where a click to you go, Oh, I see what there I have to deal with this now, if I want to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=514.08s)]
*  be effective in helping. So was that the genesis of this? And what's California facts? I think you [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=519.36s)]
*  observed it very well. And with humility, let me acknowledge that, you know, I'm this is not my [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=525.52s)]
*  first rodeo, as they say, I'm used to, you know, these guys have tried to recall me on six occasions, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=532.24s)]
*  they've got another effort underway, one went to the ballot, I've been on the receiving end for [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=537.0400000000001s)]
*  years and years and years of this surround sound coming after me, not just the state of California, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=541.76s)]
*  but as someone that pre positioned 110 engines, and a dozen aerial support, and had anticipated [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=549.44s)]
*  the high winds in LA was on the scene within 90 minutes or two hours, you're right that the amount [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=559.6s)]
*  that came was a bit overwhelming. And so we pushed back because I couldn't do it alone. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=565.6s)]
*  We pushed back by creating a platform around LA fire facts. And then we decided, look, it's it [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=570.4s)]
*  one thing and I think it started to change the conversation a little bit. I mean, we started [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=576.32s)]
*  just foundational facts that we pushed back and we are able to not just assert it, but prove the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  lies and miss and disinformation. But the same thing is happening with this California derangement [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=584.48s)]
*  syndrome that's out there 24 seven. And that's why we just put out, you're right, California facts, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=589.12s)]
*  dot gov. And it's incredibly important because it's a point of pride. But it's also an important [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=594.96s)]
*  part of the progress we're making as a state again, the fourth largest economy appreciate you [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=601.36s)]
*  highlighting that. And obviously, that's highlighted in the ad, we had record breaking tourism spend [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=606.24s)]
*  last year, years back to back of increased population, were the number one manufacturer [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=611.76s)]
*  in every category, California continues to punch above its weight. But people don't believe that [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=617.52s)]
*  and many Democrats have started to doubt that as well. So that's the idea. It's just a mechanism [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=623.92s)]
*  to push back. And it's just another one of many efforts here to iterate. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=629.28s)]
*  Yeah, I want to just talk to you about that briefly when these starts with Trump, but these [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=633.8399999999999s)]
*  mega Republicans constantly attack California. California is leading the United States of all [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=637.68s)]
*  economies, fourth largest economy in the world. Yet, this mega narratives out there and why you [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=645.68s)]
*  need a California faxes sometimes this narrative, which is false, takes hold and then it just gets [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=651.84s)]
*  repeated. And then we exist in that framework. So I'm just your overall response in addition [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  to California facts, like just your defense of California, you know, in the pushback to all that [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=663.84s)]
*  crap. No, I appreciate it. Look, I mean, we're 18% of the world's R&D, which is just foundational [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=669.2s)]
*  in terms of our capacity to continue to lead in terms of innovation and entrepreneurialism, 32 of [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=675.6800000000001s)]
*  the top 50 AI companies in the world are located in California and every major category of every [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=681.68s)]
*  major industry. California has a larger counterpart than other parts of the United States, including [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=688.4s)]
*  agriculture and forestry jobs across the spectrum, including, by the way, a framework around [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=694.2399999999999s)]
*  progressive taxation, which is interesting because now Trump himself, at least asserts modestly that [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=701.5999999999999s)]
*  he is looking to promote a progressive tax for people earning over two and a half million dollars, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=709.52s)]
*  which dare I say, looks a little bit like California. We in California have the highest tax rate for the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=714.24s)]
*  top earners, but we have very progressive rate as it relates to middle income and low wage earners. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=720.96s)]
*  And I'll give you a proof point of that. There's 16 states in America. Again, this is about facts, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=728.48s)]
*  16 states in America that tax their poorest residents more than we tax our richest residents. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=733.04s)]
*  So it begs the question, who's the high tax state? So that issue, among many other issues, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=738.48s)]
*  again, manufacturing, and I don't think most Californians know this, $412 billion of output [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=743.2s)]
*  in manufacturing. That's 41% bigger than the next state. And as we had a chance to talk a few weeks [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=748.72s)]
*  ago, I think this is profoundly important. When you look at the issue of donor states, you talk [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=754.24s)]
*  about trade imbalances and trying to level set these trade imbalances. How about the imbalance [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=759.12s)]
*  between a state like California that provided as a donor state $83.1 billion more than it received [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=764.96s)]
*  from the federal government and red states of which literally seven of the top 10 states that [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=772.0s)]
*  are taker states, dare I say, are the recipients of more federal largesse, again, are in those red [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=778.8000000000001s)]
*  parts of the country, including, by the way, the $71.1 billion that Texas takes in more than they [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=785.84s)]
*  provide the federal government. The final question, Governor, you know, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=792.32s)]
*  when I have the opportunity to speak with people like you, I know with humility as a reporter, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=796.5600000000001s)]
*  there's just some things that I'm not thinking about that I know weigh heavily on your mind. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=801.12s)]
*  I mean, your perspective as the governor, fourth largest GDP in the world, you're seeing things, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=806.0s)]
*  you're hearing things, you're thinking about things. I'm lucky I've got an audience of 5 million [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=811.5200000000001s)]
*  subscribers on YouTube and beyond that on this platform of people who just want to know what [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=816.1600000000001s)]
*  is either keeping you up at night, what are you thinking about, do you have hope? In general, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=822.0s)]
*  what do you just want our audience to know and take away right now at this moment, May 9, 2025? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=826.64s)]
*  My biggest anxiety is how serious and real this all is, not just the rule of law, not just this [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=833.12s)]
*  notion of three co-equal branches of government, the best of our, you know, of Greek democracy in [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=838.24s)]
*  the Roman Republic, this notion of popular sovereignty, all of that being at risk. But [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=845.52s)]
*  the coin of the realm above anything else is trust and the brand that is America and alliances [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=850.4s)]
*  and how that could be destroyed like that and how consequential what Donald Trump is doing in real [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=857.68s)]
*  time. And I say that not because I think it, I know it. I cannot tell you how many foreign [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=864.3199999999999s)]
*  representatives and leaders that I've met with and what they're telling us behind the scenes, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=869.68s)]
*  what they're telling us behind closed doors. It's alarming beyond words. And so, look, it takes [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=874.48s)]
*  years and years and years to build something. It could take a matter of hours to destroy something. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=880.5600000000001s)]
*  And we're seeing in real time Donald Trump's capacity to destroy our reputation, to destroy [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=886.24s)]
*  our alliances and to destroy, potentially destroy, literally, if he keeps down this path, the economy [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=892.32s)]
*  in the United States of America, it is happening in front of our eyes. And that's why I thought [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=898.4s)]
*  it was so important to do this ad and continue to remind people of the impacts of these tariffs [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngOzoJqEXbA&t=903.76s)]
