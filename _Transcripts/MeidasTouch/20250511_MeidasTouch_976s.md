# FED UP Law Dean DESTROYS Trump in PERFECT TAKEDOWN
**MeidasTouch:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g)
*  One of the most well-known deans of a top law school in the United States of America, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=0.0s)]
*  UC Berkeley School of Law, the dean's name is Dean Erwin Chemerinsky, is calling out law firms [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=6.0s)]
*  who have capitulated to the Trump administration. He's addressing this issue also very candidly with [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=12.8s)]
*  students at the law school where he is the dean. He's come out with a number of op-eds and like [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=19.76s)]
*  this one in the Daily Journal, we should be ashamed, this one in the New York Times, we should all be [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=27.28s)]
*  very, very afraid above the laws written about what Dean Chemerinsky is doing. Saying T14, that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=33.6s)]
*  means top 14 law school dean thinks law school applications are soaring thanks to Donald Trump, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=41.28s)]
*  and T14 law school dean encourages students to take into account whether big law firms capitulated [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=46.96s)]
*  when making career decisions. Now Dean Chemerinsky does not mince words. Here's what he said in one [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=53.199999999999996s)]
*  of these op-eds, as lawyers we should be ashamed that so many in our profession have capitulated [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  to authoritarianism, choosing silence and self-preservation over defending the constitution [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=66.96s)]
*  and the rule of law. He goes on to say it's not hyperbole to say that if there is a path [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  towards authoritarianism in the United States this is it. And this was written with less than [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=80.24s)]
*  a hundred days. In less than a hundred days Donald Trump has taken an astounding array of actions to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  consolidate power and stifle dissent. He's claimed authority to deport and imprison those lawfully in [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=90.08s)]
*  the United States in the maximum security prison in El Salvador. He has claimed the ability to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  eliminate federal agencies created by statute and to refuse to spend federal funds allocated by law. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=101.36s)]
*  I'll just say this as a lawyer now for about 15 years when I attended Georgetown law every law [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=108.72s)]
*  student knows Professor Chemerinsky, Dean Chemerinsky. He's argued multiple cases before [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=116.16s)]
*  the United States Supreme Court. It's not hyperbole for me, although Dean Chemerinsky is humble for me [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=123.2s)]
*  to say he's probably the most famous law professor out there right now. And again the high profile [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=129.2s)]
*  dean of UC Berkeley School of Law speaking out we need more people like this in the legal profession. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=134.96s)]
*  Let's bring in Dean Erwin Chemerinsky right now. Dean Chemerinsky great to have you on the Midas [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  Touch Network. I want to talk about you know first your statements about these law firms capitulating. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=146.16s)]
*  What are you saying to students? Tell us because your platform as the dean of a high profile top [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=153.12s)]
*  school like Berkeley you know some people would be scared. First thank you for all the kind of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=160.16s)]
*  things you said and it's a pleasure to be talking with you. I think it's important to note that what [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=165.52s)]
*  Donald Trump has done in a series of executive orders targeting law firms is clearly unconstitutional [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=170.24s)]
*  and illegal. He's open that he's doing this for retribution. He went after the law firm of Perkins [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=176.8s)]
*  Cooey because at one point it represented Hillary Clinton. He went after the law firm of Paul Weiss [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=182.4s)]
*  because at one point they employed a lawyer who'd worked for the Manhattan District Attorney's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=188.4s)]
*  office that prosecuted Trump and because they'd represented some plaintiffs suing the January 6th [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  insurrectionists. Each one of the executive orders states that it's for retribution. Four law firms [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=197.84s)]
*  so far have brought challenges to what Trump has done. All four have won in federal district courts. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  All of the district courts, two were conservative judges and two were liberal judges said that what [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=211.28s)]
*  Trump was doing violates the first amendment. It violates due process. It undermines the sixth [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=216.64s)]
*  amendment right to counsel. So one of the things that I've said to my students is you quoted that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=222.72s)]
*  when they choose what law firms to interview with and go to work for they should look to was it a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=228.72s)]
*  law firm that fought back or a law firm that unfortunately capitulated. You know some of these [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=234.64s)]
*  firms that are capitulating were so revered. I mean when you know whether it was you starting [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  UC Irvine School of Law as their first dean now in your position at Berkeley. When I went to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  Georgetown Law I mean they would recruit. They talk about pro bono services. They talk about diversity [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=256.0s)]
*  and inclusion and you know they'd really pitch that and so you know I'm not sure if people outside [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=263.04s)]
*  of the legal community like fully grasp like almost what a betrayal these firms have been [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=269.36s)]
*  around for such a long time to go this route. I mean did you see it coming and what do how do you [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=275.12s)]
*  interact with these firms on a day-to-day basis knowing that betrayal? What's so important to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=283.44s)]
*  emphasize is how clearly illegal and unconstitutional the Trump executive orders have been with regard to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=291.68s)]
*  law firms. They're punishing law firms for their advocacy to protect by the First Amendment. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=298.64s)]
*  They're imposing sanctions that literally could put the law firms out of business without [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=304.24s)]
*  due process. They're undermining the right to counsel. If all of the law firms had fought back [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=307.76s)]
*  in the way that Perkins, Cooey, Jenner and Block, Willem or Hal have fought back [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=314.64s)]
*  this would have ended but because the law firms capitulated it's continued what President Trump [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=321.04s)]
*  has done. We all learned on the playground if you give into a bullet you only make it worse. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=329.12s)]
*  Let's talk about Trump's other attacks on the rule of law. The fact that I have to get from [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=335.6s)]
*  your perspective like when you see these debates on corporate news about due process and whether [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  due process should or shouldn't be given and that there's a split screen and there's a side [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=349.76s)]
*  of people who are arguing no due process in the United States of America outwardly. That's the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=356.88s)]
*  argument. No due process to people. You disappear them. You send them to Sikad in El Salvador. Now [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  what they were recently talking about Libya. Where else? What do you think about? Let's talk [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=372.0s)]
*  just your overall reaction to that taking place in these United States. The Fifth Amendment says [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=378.32s)]
*  no person should provide life, liberty or property without due process of law. It doesn't say no [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  citizen. It doesn't say no documented person. It's no person can provide life, liberty, property [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=394.32s)]
*  without due process of law. We've got to remember one of the reasons we have due process is to make [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=402.4s)]
*  sure the government's not making a mistake. The government may believe that somebody's part of a [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=406.72s)]
*  Venezuelan gang or somebody is dangerous, but we need to have process to make sure that they really [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=411.6s)]
*  are part of the Venezuelan gang or they really are dangerous. And so maybe there's two people on a [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=418.16s)]
*  split screen, but that doesn't mean there's two arguments of equal weight. The Constitution has [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  always been thought to provide due process to everyone here, citizen and non-citizen, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=429.36s)]
*  documented and undocumented. Dean Chemerinsky, what do you make of the resiliency of the federal [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=434.8s)]
*  court system right now? I mean, we're seeing, you know, a Trump appointed judge in the Southern [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=441.92s)]
*  District of Texas, Judge Rodriguez. You're seeing a Trump appointed judge in Louisiana, Tredge [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=448.8s)]
*  Doughty. You're seeing a Trump appointed judge in Maryland and the language, at least on these due [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=456.8s)]
*  process cases, seems very similar to your Obama appointed judge or your Biden appointed judge or [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=463.68s)]
*  your Clinton appointed judge. It's not to mention, you know, your Reagan appointed judges like [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=470.96s)]
*  Lamberth and, you know, and others who have ruled against her. I mean, sometimes, you know, as a [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=475.6s)]
*  former practicing lawyer, it makes me uncomfortable even to have to say a Trump appointed judge did [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=480.16s)]
*  this and a disappointed judge. Is that how I used to talk about these things? But what do you make [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=485.12s)]
*  of just the resiliency of the federal court? Are there things that concern you? Are you surprised? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=488.88s)]
*  Do you think it's holding up? What's your overall thoughts there? Ultimately, if our democracy is [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=493.92s)]
*  going to survive, it's going to be because of the courts. They're right now the primary guardrail [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=499.28s)]
*  of democracy. President Trump doesn't have people around him ruling to say no. The Republican [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  Congress so far has only to say no. But the courts have been. And I think the fact that you have [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  both liberal and conservative judges, Democratic appointees and Republican appointees, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=516.64s)]
*  repeatedly saying no to Donald Trump should tell us something. It should tell us that what he's [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=522.64s)]
*  doing isn't a close question under the law. He's blatantly violating core constitutional principles. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=528.0s)]
*  Now, Dean Chemerinsky, you've argued multiple cases before the Supreme Court. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=536.0s)]
*  You're humble, so I'll just say it. You're also just a savant on Supreme Court history. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=541.68s)]
*  For those who know, one of the things that Dean Chemerinsky will do in his speaking engagements, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=546.96s)]
*  he could pretty much cite for you footnote 23 in a 1963 obscure case that nobody's heard of. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=552.24s)]
*  So you know the court very, very well. You know all the justices. And you've studied the court, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=558.4s)]
*  its dynamics better than about anybody. So talk to us now about the dynamic that exists on the court [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=566.48s)]
*  with the types of cases you're going to start to see next week nationwide injunctions [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=574.24s)]
*  as kind of the precursor to the birthright citizenship issue. But I think the threshold [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=580.96s)]
*  question is, are nationwide injunctions allowed or not allowed? Talked about that one, but more [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=585.6s)]
*  broadly, what dynamic you see based on the composition of the justices, the groups that [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=590.5600000000001s)]
*  are being formed that you see as other cases make their way to the Supreme Court? What are you looking [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=597.2s)]
*  at? Sure. It's a court that has six conservative justices appointed by Republican presidents, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=601.92s)]
*  Roberts, Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, and three liberal justices appointed [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=608.56s)]
*  by Democratic presidents, Son of Merrick, Kagan, and Jackson. I think the Supreme Court's going to [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=613.52s)]
*  have a mixed record in the end in terms of whether or not they uphold what Trump's done [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=619.04s)]
*  or whether they strike it down. They have a mixed record already. So far what they've said is that [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=623.5999999999999s)]
*  Trump administration can't put people in El Salvador. Just a couple of weeks ago, the Supreme [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=629.36s)]
*  Court entered an order and it was seven to two, only Alito and Thomas dissenting, saying no further [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=635.68s)]
*  individuals can be placed in the El Salvador maximum prison without prior approval from the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=642.88s)]
*  Supreme Court. On the other hand, with regard to the cutoff of funds, there have been two Supreme [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=647.68s)]
*  Court rulings. One allowed Trump to cut off the funds that were appropriated by statute. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=653.36s)]
*  One invalidated it. Both were five to four with only Justice Barrett and the majority in both, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=658.88s)]
*  and she didn't write. I think there are instances where the Trump administration is going to lose. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=665.36s)]
*  I think they'll lose ultimately on birthright citizenship. I think there's instances where [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=670.4s)]
*  the Trump administration may win. I think the court's going to give the president a lot of [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=674.48s)]
*  latitude to fire people in the executive branch. I don't know what the Supreme Court's going to do [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=678.32s)]
*  in the case that's going to be argued next Thursday. It's Trump versus Casa, Trump versus [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=683.36s)]
*  Washington, and Trump versus New Jersey. And as you point out, the issue is, can a federal district [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=688.88s)]
*  court issue an injunction for the entire country? It's always been understood that it can happen. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=694.48s)]
*  The alternative seems draconian. It requires somebody to file lawsuits in all 94 federal [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=700.64s)]
*  districts. It could lead to absurd results. Somebody born in one federal district be a citizen, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=706.4s)]
*  someone born under identical circumstances in another district wouldn't be a citizen. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=712.56s)]
*  But I don't know what the court's going to do on that issue. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=717.1999999999999s)]
*  Where do you see the Abraco? For everybody who knows, for me, this is like me geeking out at my [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=719.92s)]
*  finest right now. I get to ask Dean Chemerinsky all of these incredible questions. I hope our [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=725.92s)]
*  viewers are having fun too. Tell us about, what do you think is going to happen with Abraco Garcia? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=731.1999999999999s)]
*  You had the most recent development is that after being ordered into expedited discovery, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=737.2800000000001s)]
*  the Trump regime has invoked the state secrets doctrine. Judge Zinnis in Maryland has said, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=743.2s)]
*  describe this. What's the state secrets issue right there? So you have that with Abraco. Maybe [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=750.5600000000001s)]
*  if you can talk to that. But then we have other cases like that that are not getting the same [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=755.6s)]
*  amount of attention. Another case with a Trump appointed judge in Maryland where the district [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=760.96s)]
*  court judge said, facilitate the return there. And we've had three or four courts right now, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=766.0s)]
*  New York, Southern District of Texas, Colorado, and I think one other saying the alien enemies [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=770.56s)]
*  act is invalidated. But we have hundreds of people at CICOT, this camp in El Salvador, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=776.08s)]
*  this terrorism, whatever you want to call it in El Salvador. Tell us what you think is happening [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=782.48s)]
*  in these cases. There's so many layers to it. And on every level, what the Trump administration [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=786.88s)]
*  has done is illegal and unconstitutional. First, the Trump administration has invoked, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=792.88s)]
*  as you point out, the alien enemy act of 1798 as a basis for taking people in Pueblo, El Salvador. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=797.76s)]
*  The alien enemy act applies if there is, quote, a declared war or an imminent military invasion, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=804.56s)]
*  and it allows for people and a hostile enemy to return to their home country. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=811.36s)]
*  The alien enemy acts only been used during the war of 1812, World War I and World War II. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=816.64s)]
*  That's why Judge Rodriguez in Texas said it has no application here. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=821.6s)]
*  Several judges said that. Second, even if the alien enemy act applies, there still has to be [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=825.68s)]
*  due process before somebody is deported or somebody's imprisoned. The individuals who have [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=830.96s)]
*  been put in a maximum security prison in El Salvador have been given no due process at all. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=836.3199999999999s)]
*  That's why, third, every court has ruled against the Trump administration on this. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=841.28s)]
*  In the Abrego Garcia case, a lawyer for the Justice Department told the judge [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=846.96s)]
*  that he was taken there by mistake. Maybe it was a mistake. Maybe, as now the Trump [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=852.16s)]
*  administration claims, it wasn't a mistake. But that's what due process is all about. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=857.52s)]
*  And so I think the judges are going to order that the people be brought back from El Salvador. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=862.0s)]
*  And I think the Supreme Court is going to agree the government has to facilitate that. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=868.08s)]
*  But then what's going to happen? Will the Trump administration comply or will they defy the courts? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=872.4s)]
*  That's what we have to wait and see. Final topic, law school applications on the rise. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=878.0799999999999s)]
*  You say because of the policies of Trump. Can you talk to that? I know lots of law students [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=884.3199999999999s)]
*  in where I teach also say, you know, when there's recessionary environments, that's one of the [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=892.4s)]
*  reasons that people start applying to law schools because they're worried about the job market. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=897.52s)]
*  Is that what you meant by that? Or are there other reasons as well? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=902.0s)]
*  I've been doing this a long time and I've seen law school applications go up and law school [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=906.24s)]
*  applications go down. And we're always speculating as to why it happens. I think in this instance, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=910.56s)]
*  some of it at least is Donald Trump's election as president. I'm seeing more people applying [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=917.36s)]
*  and wanting to come to law school to fight for democracy. When I talk to our admitted students [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=924.0s)]
*  and I'm asking them why law school, that's what I'm hearing. Some of it I think is the economy. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=929.28s)]
*  There's fear of a recession and going to law school seems a good thing to do in a hard job market. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=934.4s)]
*  So hard to know exactly why, but no doubt law school applications went up this year. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=940.4s)]
*  Dean Erwin Chemerinsky, Dean of UC Berkeley School of Law, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IKrroyk_g&t=946.0799999999999s)]
