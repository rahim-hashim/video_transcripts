# LIVE: MeidasTouch RESPONDS to MAJOR Breaking News - 6/19/25
**MeidasTouch:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE)
*  The Midas Touch Network hit 5 million subscribers on our YouTube today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks to you, the Midas Mighty. We'll get into that, but we've got a lot of news to discuss. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=6.32s)]
*  E. Jean Carroll and her lawyer Roberta Kaplan broke their silence about the back-to-back [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  federal trials that they defeated Donald Trump in in New York, where Donald Trump was found liable [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=16.88s)]
*  for sexual abuse and for defamation. The case is currently still through the appellate process, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=22.959999999999997s)]
*  but E. Jean Carroll keeps winning during the appellate process, but she expressed to us [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=30.88s)]
*  things that she's never told anybody else about the trial. Let's watch what went down. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=37.6s)]
*  And what this book does is we approach things in a light way, because we understand this is a man [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=42.0s)]
*  who wears apricot makeup with his hair twirled around his head like Barbara Stanwyck in Ball of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=52.48s)]
*  Fire, who we can beat. Robbie figured that out five years ago. I was so close, Ben, Ben, I was so close. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=61.68s)]
*  If I went this far and reached back, I could have him by the hair. I heard almost every single thing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=73.44s)]
*  he said. Robbie had to stand up and object to Judge Kaplan, saying, Your Honor, if we can hear [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=80.16s)]
*  him, what does the jury think? And by the way, Ben, when you looked at the jury, they were like [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=86.56s)]
*  stunned by the moaning and his groaning and his weeping and his snarling and his, oh, he was very [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=92.16s)]
*  cruel to Alina Jaba, Esquire, really treated her terribly. I don't know how she carried on, but we [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=100.64s)]
*  were there. We saw everything. The farting, you wanted to know about that? I didn't say that, but [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=107.68s)]
*  it was a silent one. It was a silent one, sort of. That's all. All right. A. Jean Carroll and her [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=113.92s)]
*  lawyer, Robbie Kaplan, breaking their silence about Donald Trump, perhaps breaking other things [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  during the federal trial. The full podcast involving A. Jean Carroll and Robbie Kaplan's [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  on the Midas Touch podcast. You should watch the full one and listen to the full one because it [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=132.72s)]
*  we actually cover a lot of ground that's never been covered before. But I start with that clip [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=138.16s)]
*  at the beginning of this episode because we have a deeply unserious, deeply unwell, sexually abuser, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=142.32s)]
*  someone who's also separately been convicted as a felon in a business records case, someone [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=150.08s)]
*  who's bankrupted businesses running the White House right now and is just a complete and utter [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  disaster. The world views him as completely pathetic and weak. Here we are recording this [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=163.04s)]
*  on Thursday. After Donald Trump spent Wednesday whining that he hasn't played golf in the past [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  few weeks, he's leaving to go and play golf right now. He delivered a message through his chief [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=178.56s)]
*  propagandist, Caroline Levitt, that the United States will make its determination about whether [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=185.84s)]
*  to invade Iran or not in two weeks. Donald Trump needs two weeks to assess what's going on. Now, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=192.64s)]
*  Donald Trump says two weeks about everything. Two weeks for his health care plan. Just give it [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  two more weeks. Two weeks to determine whether or not to sanction Putin. Two weeks to determine [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=205.76s)]
*  what the United States is going to do regarding Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Two weeks, two weeks, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  that's Donald Trump's basic statement for he's not going to do anything. He's just going to wait [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=218.72s)]
*  and then see what happens and then either try to run away from accountability or take credit [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=223.84s)]
*  depending on what happens. But before I show you what Caroline Levitt said at the press conference, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=229.6s)]
*  I think we have a clip of Donald Trump from April and May repeatedly when asked, well, what are you [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=234.88s)]
*  going to do with Putin? You promised there would be peace in Ukraine in 24 hours. That hasn't happened. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=242.48s)]
*  Putin continues to escalate things. Donald, what are you going to do? Let's roll tape. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=247.6s)]
*  You crushed President Putin. You know, in about two weeks. Is Ukraine doing enough to get this? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=252.72s)]
*  I'd rather tell you in about two weeks from now. You think two weeks about President Putin? What [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=258.88s)]
*  is two weeks? Give us what is the actual date? What is the timeline? Two weeks or less. And if [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=264.8s)]
*  it's a little more at the time, I say, but you know, they're losing a lot of people. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=270.0s)]
*  Cool. You see those little dates up at the top, April 27th, May 19th. Today is May 28th. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=274.16s)]
*  So two weeks, two weeks, two weeks. Now we're still two weeks away. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=280.56s)]
*  And today is June 19th and still two weeks, two weeks, two weeks. Now it's two weeks though, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  about whether the United States is going to send its military to engage in regime change in Iran. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  I think that's where they're at right now. It's unclear what they're even talking about. Is it [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=299.36s)]
*  denuclearization? Is it regime change? But I want to show you what Caroline Levitt read today in a [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=303.12s)]
*  press briefing that she did. And then I want to discuss with Brett, Jordi and all the Midas, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=310.32s)]
*  Mighty, how this just completely undercuts everything that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=314.72s)]
*  have been saying here. Play this clip. Now regarding the ongoing situation in Iran, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=318.96s)]
*  I know there has been a lot of speculation amongst all of you in the media regarding the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=324.08s)]
*  president's decision-making and whether or not the United States will be directly involved. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=327.92s)]
*  In light of that news, I have a message directly from the president. And I quote, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=332.64s)]
*  based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=337.52s)]
*  place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=342.64s)]
*  two weeks. That's a quote directly from the president for all of you today. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=348.64s)]
*  But Brett and Jordi, didn't Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu and all the Fox propagandists [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=354.0s)]
*  and everybody on cable news say that Iran was going to have a nuclear weapon within a day [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=360.24s)]
*  or within two days. It was so urgent, so urgent that we needed decapitation strikes [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=366.88s)]
*  right away. American troops needed to be in the ground right away because it was just days away [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=373.52s)]
*  Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. But now Donald Trump is saying that he's going to need [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  two weeks, which is for people following along, more than a few days. And Trump is going to go [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  and just play golf now this weekend. Now that undercuts, of course, everything that Trump and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu and everyone's saying, but we didn't need to hear that as confirmation. I mean, we have been [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=398.32s)]
*  hearing Iran's about to have a nuclear weapon now for a very, very long time as justifications. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  We've been hearing that probably for what, the past 20 or 30 years. You had former President Obama [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=413.28s)]
*  enter into a nuclear deal to denuclearize Iran that Donald Trump pulled us out of. We heard from [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=419.28s)]
*  Donald Trump's director of national intelligence in the past 90 days, Tulsi Gabbard, who said that [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=425.28s)]
*  Iran is not capable of producing a nuclear weapon in the near term, certainly not in the next few [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=430.15999999999997s)]
*  days. And I want to be clear where I stand. I don't want the Ayatollah to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=439.36s)]
*  I don't like the Ayatollah. I don't think that the Ayatollah and the way Iran is being run is good [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=444.56s)]
*  for the world. I think they're a dangerous regime. I think they're horrible and awful. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=451.2s)]
*  Just as an American, I don't want to get us into an endless Middle East war again, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=455.92s)]
*  where we're committing troops. What is our goal? Denuclearization? Is it ceasefire? Is it regime [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=460.56s)]
*  change? What is it? You have people on Fox talking about America dropping nukes on Iran that can bust [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=467.52s)]
*  through the ground in order to basically hit where they claim the nuclear program is taking place. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=477.84s)]
*  They're talking about Americans dropping nukes or bunker busting bombs. What happens if you get [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  rid of? What if you get rid of the Ayatollah? You're going to have a bloody civil war in Iran. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=489.52s)]
*  What does that mean for America? Clarity. What the hell is even happening? That's where I approach [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=494.48s)]
*  this, Brett and Jordy. I agree, Ben. And it's great to be here and great to see everybody. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=499.68s)]
*  Congrats on 5 million to the whole community here. Huge accomplishment and thank you and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=503.6s)]
*  congrats to everybody for being a part of this. But yeah, Ben, it makes me think this is why Trump [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=508.8s)]
*  is incapable of making a deal in any scenario. It's not just this Iran nuclear situation that [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=513.28s)]
*  we're seeing right now, but let's go back to the tariffs. In order to make a deal, all parties in [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=518.88s)]
*  the deal need to understand what the other party wants. And if there's no clarity as to what the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=524.0s)]
*  end game is, what the actual goal of the deal that is in question is, then how could you possibly [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=528.96s)]
*  negotiate and how could you possibly move the ball forward? So with the tariffs, we heard Trump say [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=534.56s)]
*  every kind of thing in the book. Oh, this is going to make America rich. We're going to be richer [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=539.28s)]
*  than ever. We want these tariffs. These are actually going to be permanent and everybody's [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=543.52s)]
*  going to be rich and I'm going to be handing out money. We also heard this is a negotiating tactic [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=547.76s)]
*  and we actually want the other countries to lower their tariffs. But then when people in the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=552.16s)]
*  administration were asked about, okay, so if they lowered their tariffs to zero, would you take away [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=556.48s)]
*  their tariffs? They go, no, that's not what that's not actually what we want. How could the other [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=560.9599999999999s)]
*  party actually know what they should be doing if you don't have a clear sense of what you want? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=565.4399999999999s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing here in this Iran situation. Do you want to denuclearize Iran? Do [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=570.16s)]
*  you want to do regime change in Iran? And we're not hearing what the actual plan is here, but it's [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=575.8399999999999s)]
*  very clear that Trump and this administration are willing to send Americans into war for this. They [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=581.92s)]
*  are willing to join this war and I want to be clear too that we are already very much involved [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  in this effort, mostly from a defensive capacity, but we are very much involved in this war to the [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=591.92s)]
*  point where Wikipedia even lists the United States as one of the belligerents in the war as long [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=597.8399999999999s)]
*  along with Israel. So we are well a part of this already. Now it's going to, we got to see, you know, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=602.8s)]
*  how deep we're going to go into this thing. And I've heard my entire life, Ben, as you said, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=608.0s)]
*  at least two decades, probably more, I've heard Iran, it's going to, they're going to have a [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=612.88s)]
*  nuclear tomorrow. They're going to have a nuke tomorrow. They're going to have a nuke tomorrow. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=616.64s)]
*  It's coming. It's coming three days away. We better take action. We better take action. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=619.28s)]
*  So finally, president, I've heard that through, by the way, administrations of both parties. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=623.04s)]
*  And so finally, uh, former president Barack Obama negotiated this deal. We saw Iran's nuclear [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=626.96s)]
*  program go to like zero. Like they were no longer doing anything as far as a nuclear weapons program [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=633.12s)]
*  is concerned. And one of the first things Trump did in the middle of his term, he threw that deal [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=640.0s)]
*  right away. And ever since then, they have been building back their nuclear program. They now, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=644.48s)]
*  our own intelligence agencies seem to say that at least in public, that there is no evidence that [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=649.5999999999999s)]
*  they are very close to a nuclear weapon, but that's not what Netanyahu is saying. That's not what [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=656.0s)]
*  Trump is saying. That's not what the war hawks and the Republican party and someone, the Democratic [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=660.88s)]
*  side are saying, but Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump's DNI, a few months ago in March, she went out there [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=664.96s)]
*  and she said that Iran is not working towards a nuclear weapon right now. That's what she said [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=670.56s)]
*  in public. And so one of the issues about all the lies that we're seeing right now is we simply don't [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=675.28s)]
*  know what to trust. We don't know what to believe. And that's one of the issues. So when I hear all [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=680.96s)]
*  this incoming from the administration, and if you turn on Fox right now, they are blood thirsty. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=685.68s)]
*  They want a war. I mean, I'm getting flashbacks right now. What do you want? They want to nuke [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=690.56s)]
*  them? Yeah, they want a nuclear war. I'm getting flashbacks right now to, you know, 9-11, post-9-11 [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  when we got into Iraq. You know, it's the same sort of rhetoric that we're hearing. It's the same sort [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=701.76s)]
*  of, you know, warmongering. It's the same sort of, oh, you know, they're going to get weapons or they [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=706.56s)]
*  have weapons of mass destruction or they're going to get weapons of mass destruction in just a few [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=712.3199999999999s)]
*  days. We got to go in there now. We got to go in there now. And I'm sorry, I'm not willing to risk [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=715.76s)]
*  American troops. I'm not willing to put Americans on the line for this one. You know, people could [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=720.08s)]
*  say on the right, oh, but you thought Ukraine was a good idea. You thought, yeah, because that [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=724.64s)]
*  prevented Americans from getting into a war. Like, if you want to really go there, Biden was actually [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=729.44s)]
*  the peace president. Biden actually kept American troops out of war, kept American troops out of [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=735.36s)]
*  Ukraine, kept them out of that conflict by giving the support that we gave. Biden actually pulled [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=740.72s)]
*  our troops out of Afghanistan. And you criticized him for it because it wasn't perfect because he [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=746.4s)]
*  was dealing with the fact that Trump completely screwed the whole thing up by releasing 5,000 [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=750.88s)]
*  Taliban prisoners. So don't give me that crap. Let's look at the reality of the situation. And [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=755.36s)]
*  we see right now that this Trump presidency and the way Fox is going, it feels much more like a [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=760.8s)]
*  Bush 3.0 than anything else. Everybody should be concerned right now that the Republican party [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=765.92s)]
*  right now is ramping up this war machine just like they did in the post 9-11 world. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=771.4399999999999s)]
*  Jory. Absolutely, Brett. And to your point, the juxtaposition between President Biden and [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=775.52s)]
*  Donald Trump, it could not be more clear in this instance. What did Biden do? He got us out of war. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=782.48s)]
*  What's Trump doing? He's getting us into war. Look, you don't elect leaders because nothing [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=787.52s)]
*  wrong is going to happen and bad things won't happen. You elect the leaders for when inevitably [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=794.16s)]
*  bad things happen, that they're there to meet the moment and help guide you through bad and difficult [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=799.1999999999999s)]
*  situations. But what we have right now is this cacistocracy. It's the most incompetent people [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=805.12s)]
*  running the government. You see Caroline Levitt up there. I'm sorry, that chief propagandist, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=810.72s)]
*  she has a third grade reading level. I mean, when she was reading that statement, it just [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=817.28s)]
*  sounded straight out of North Korea. What are we doing? What are we doing? And it's frustrating [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=821.52s)]
*  from a standpoint of these are American lives that are going to be on the line, that are already on [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=827.12s)]
*  the line. And the Donald Trump and the Trump regime, they're just going to get a pass because [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=832.48s)]
*  Fox News is buffering up their coverage and getting all of their viewers excited about nuclear war, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=837.52s)]
*  this and no, none of this that we're witnessing is okay. And again, this is why it's so freaking [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=844.16s)]
*  important to elect leaders that actually know what the heck they're doing and don't just want to put [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=851.6s)]
*  their fingerprints on everything. Because that's what Donald Trump is doing in this in presidency, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=857.84s)]
*  right? When it comes to the tariffs, why is he doing that? The economy, right? We were the envy [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=863.6800000000001s)]
*  of the world, right? The economy was going back on track under President Biden. Donald Trump comes [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=868.8000000000001s)]
*  in, oh, we're going to do these tariffs. Let me put my fingerprints on there. Let me do it. And [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=874.48s)]
*  just totally throws everything up in shambles. This is the craziest report, by the way. Trump, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=879.36s)]
*  so when Trump was debating at first, this is a legitimate report that came out when Trump was [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=884.72s)]
*  debating at first, should the US get involved in this Iran, Israel situation, Trump, you know, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=889.12s)]
*  wasn't 100% sure. But then he saw that Fox News was praising Israel's attacks on Iran. And he liked [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=895.6s)]
*  the images of war, he liked the images of the bombs raining down on Iran. And Fox was saying how [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=902.88s)]
*  brilliant of a campaign it was, because Israel was taking out the top military, the top leaders in [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=908.08s)]
*  Iran and nuclear scientists. And Trump wanted to feel like he was part of it. And so Trump went all [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=913.6s)]
*  in because of the way it looked on Fox News. And that's what you see. And I just want to show you [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=919.84s)]
*  this clip just like for context, because we're not making this up here, right? Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=924.0s)]
*  this is Donald Trump's director of national intelligence. This was Tulsi Gabbard in March [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=928.32s)]
*  of this year, speaking about whether or not Iran is actually in the process and close to building [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=933.28s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. Now, I want you to listen to what she has to say. Then I want you to listen [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=939.6s)]
*  to what Trump had to say in response to her comments when Trump was asked about what Tulsi [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=944.24s)]
*  said, the intelligence, what they said about what is going on. Check this out. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=949.44s)]
*  I don't care what she said is what Donald Trump said about his director of national intelligence. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=969.6s)]
*  Now, whether he cares or doesn't care, could you imagine a leader in any organization taken outside [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=986.24s)]
*  of this context, which is a very serious one. But just assume you were asking someone who's a CEO [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=994.0s)]
*  of a company, your CFO has said the following about your revenue projections. I don't care [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1001.76s)]
*  what the hell my CFO has to say about revenue projections. How do you think the stock would do [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1008.8s)]
*  with that company? And do you think investors would want to invest in that company? Now you bring it [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1013.92s)]
*  here to the context of the director of national intelligence, the top intelligence official in the [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1018.64s)]
*  United States who has access across all agencies to what's supposed to be the best available data. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1024.8799999999999s)]
*  And Donald Trump says, I don't really care about it at all. And then I'll show you this clip right [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1032.24s)]
*  here. This is Benjamin Netanyahu over the years, over the decades, various forum hats in various [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1037.12s)]
*  locations saying, I ran as a few days away from getting a nuclear weapon. He says it over and over [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1045.36s)]
*  and over again, over the past few decades. And again, I want to be clear. I don't want [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1051.4399999999998s)]
*  Iran to have nuclear weapons. If I believed that Iran had a nuclear weapon and was about to use it [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1056.8s)]
*  against the United States or against our allies, yes, you can convince me that action needs to be [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1064.56s)]
*  taken immediately. But you need to stop lying to me over and over and over again about literally [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1071.2s)]
*  every single freaking thing because we're talking about the lives of our soldiers. So stop making it [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1077.76s)]
*  up and then just expecting us to be like, whatever. I mean, here, let me show you these receipts again. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1084.0s)]
*  The deadline for attaining this goal is getting extremely close. And Iran, by the way, is also [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1091.1200000000001s)]
*  outpacing Iraq in the development of ballistic missile systems that they hope will reach the [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1098.32s)]
*  Eastern seaboard of the United States within 15 years. By next spring, by next summer, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1103.6s)]
*  at current enrichment rates, they will have finished the medium enrichment and move on to [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1110.3999999999999s)]
*  the final stage. From there, it's only a few months, possibly a few weeks before they get [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1117.9199999999998s)]
*  enough enriched uranium for the first bomb. The foremost sponsor of global terrorism [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1125.04s)]
*  could be weeks away from having enough enriched uranium for an entire arsenal of nuclear weapons. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1131.84s)]
*  That would place a militant Islamic terror regime weeks away from having the fissile material [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1139.2s)]
*  for an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs. If not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1147.04s)]
*  in a very short time. It could be a year. It could be within a few months, less than a year. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1153.52s)]
*  Then recently they said a few days. And now Donald Trump says that he will decide what he's [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1161.36s)]
*  going to do in two weeks. So Caroline Levitt was asked a good question by a reporter. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1168.48s)]
*  Donald Trump says two weeks about Russia. He says two weeks about everything. What's going to really [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1174.24s)]
*  happen in the two weeks? And now you'll notice Caroline Levitt's strategy, because there's no [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1179.28s)]
*  good answer to it. She attacks former president Biden and just keeps on blaming Biden for the [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1184.72s)]
*  current situation. And then she goes on to take credit. She says that Trump deserves credit [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1193.28s)]
*  for the peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. That by Donald Trump saying two weeks, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1201.12s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine have had some very successful peace negotiations, which is false. If anything, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1208.72s)]
*  things have gotten much worse, especially over the past few days with Russia attacking Ukraine [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1214.8000000000002s)]
*  using Iranian drones, by the way, and ballistic missiles, killing people in Kiev and across [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1221.76s)]
*  Ukraine. Here, play this clip. There's still a substantial chance is my question. I'm not going [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1227.68s)]
*  to get into the reasoning and the rationale. The president believes that, but that's his position [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1231.52s)]
*  and he will make a decision within the next two weeks. Thanks, Caroline. President Trump has said [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1235.52s)]
*  previously in regard to Russia, he's used this phrase about two weeks several times in terms of [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1240.56s)]
*  like we expect like a two week deadline and then you get another two week deadline. How can we be [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1246.48s)]
*  sure that he's going to stick to this one on making a decision on Iran? Well, in those deadlines, as [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1251.12s)]
*  you've seen in respect to Russia, Ukraine, might I add these are two very different complicated [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1256.6399999999999s)]
*  global conflicts. As you know, that the president inherited from our previous incompetent president [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1261.12s)]
*  in the weakness of the previous administration and the president has spent a tremendous amount [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1266.6399999999999s)]
*  of time and effort cleaning up these crises that were caused by the last administration's just [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1270.8s)]
*  complete dereliction of duty on the world stage and American weakness. Now we have American strength [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1276.0s)]
*  again with respect to Russia and Ukraine because of that American strength and the president's [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1280.2399999999998s)]
*  leadership. We have seen these two sides engage in direct negotiations and the last time the [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1285.12s)]
*  president said two weeks, you saw Russia and Ukraine have direct negotiations for the first [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1290.0s)]
*  time in years and so the president is always interested in a diplomatic solution to the [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1294.32s)]
*  problems and the global conflicts in this world. Again, he is a peacemaker in chief. He is the [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1299.04s)]
*  peace through strength president and so if there's a chance for diplomacy, the president's always [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1303.68s)]
*  going to grab it but he's not afraid to use strength as well, I will add. Frances. I don't even know [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1307.92s)]
*  what you're adding other than being a horrible human being to the world, adding your existence [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1313.28s)]
*  as just a vile and horrible lying human being. I mean to pivot that to attack former president Biden [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1321.2s)]
*  when the simple question was what are you going to do in the next two weeks? That was the question [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1330.96s)]
*  and then she says attacks Biden and then she says that there was some great conversations [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1337.6000000000001s)]
*  that happened between Ukraine and Putin as a result of Donald Trump saying two weeks, you know, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1345.3600000000001s)]
*  the Trump two-week scam because Trump says like I started off by showing the E. Jean Carroll video [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1350.48s)]
*  for a reason because at his core, Donald Trump is a sexual abuser, right? Donald Trump is a felon. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1357.2800000000002s)]
*  He is a con artist. He is a scammer. He is a bankruptor. He is a loser. He's someone who joins [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1366.24s)]
*  a sports team or join a football team and then he gets tackled and then he quits the sport. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1376.3999999999999s)]
*  He's someone who shows up at the G7 and when he was not the center of attention and when there was [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1383.76s)]
*  adult leadership taking place and adult conversations, no offense to like spoiled [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1390.0s)]
*  brats or like third graders or whatever, it was like he showed up at the sleepover party in third [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1398.8s)]
*  grade or fourth grade and nobody wanted to hang with him and no one thought he was cool [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1406.0s)]
*  so he called his parents and went back home and came up with like an excuse to try to leave [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1410.48s)]
*  because at his core, he is a loser. He never had friends. People don't like him. He's a bad guy [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1416.64s)]
*  and he ruins things. He ruins things. So one of the qualities is taco that Trump always chickens [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1427.2800000000002s)]
*  out but part of the mechanism of taco is two weeks. It's a defensive mechanism for him to just be like [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1434.4s)]
*  let me just see what happens and if it goes bad, I will blame aside for it and take credit that I [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1444.32s)]
*  didn't do something. If it goes well, I will try to take credit for it and pretend that I did it. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1451.84s)]
*  Now that style of non-leadership results in one thing over and over again in his career and we're [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1459.6s)]
*  seeing it now for our country, bankruptcy. That's where it leads because that's not an [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1469.36s)]
*  effective way to say the least about being a leader. I'm not talking even about a democratic [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1474.9599999999998s)]
*  policy or a republican policy. I'm literally talking about being an adult, being a leader, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1480.6399999999999s)]
*  meeting deadlines. If you are invited to a conference where you're one of the main [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1487.9199999999998s)]
*  participants, especially if it's the G7, you stay for both days. You don't go home like a little baby [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1493.28s)]
*  even if they're being mean to you. You stick it out. You stay both days. You meet with the people. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1501.76s)]
*  You handle business. You go back home and when you're dealing with crisis, you confront it. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1508.48s)]
*  You show leadership. You talk about things. You don't go two weeks and then go, oh I like that [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1514.24s)]
*  strike by Israel. I did it. I don't like that strike. I don't like it. I think one of the [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1519.28s)]
*  things that Donald Trump was reacting to with a lot of this and this changed the dynamic, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1524.8s)]
*  I think Trump looked and saw that Iran was firing ballistic missiles into Tel Aviv and into [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1530.08s)]
*  southern Israel and they landed some missiles at some pretty high value targets. I think Donald [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1536.32s)]
*  Trump went from going, he goes back and forth. I think he goes from thinking that, oh I'm going [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1542.96s)]
*  to do this. I'm not going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm not going to do this and no one [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1548.56s)]
*  knows what the hell he's doing and so when we come back, I want to share with you things that you're [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1552.24s)]
*  not seeing anywhere on cable news. I want to show you what world leaders are saying about Donald Trump [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1557.2s)]
*  that is not being covered here and I want to also talk about the war against the Houthis, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1564.6399999999999s)]
*  which America lost. America's actively covering up that we lost a war in Yemen to the Houthis who [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1571.5200000000002s)]
*  knocked out two F-18s, seven Reaper drones. Donald Trump then called them honorable people, entered [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1580.3200000000002s)]
*  into a ceasefire, promised commercial vessels would be able to traverse the Red Sea, which has [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1587.44s)]
*  not happened to this day and then they lie and commit fraud like Donald Trump did in his business [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1593.3600000000001s)]
*  dealings to try to act like we had some successful operation when one of the things we know is that [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1598.56s)]
*  classified information was put on signal chats and then the defense to that was but the operation [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1605.28s)]
*  was successful. No it wasn't. America lost the war to the Houthis and no one talks about it here. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1611.36s)]
*  Like it's like it's living in a propaganda regime where we pretend everything is beautiful, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1617.44s)]
*  everything is good. Well we'll come with the receipts after our first quick break. I want [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=1624.4s)]

*  going to do 90 deals in 90 days and he's basically done zero deals in 90 days. I don't know what it [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2029.04s)]
*  was that he dropped and made Prime Minister Keir Starmer pick up and bend on his knees because [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2035.76s)]
*  Donald Trump wouldn't pick it up himself when they were talking together. But that certainly [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2040.3999999999999s)]
*  isn't a trade deal. Trade deals are hundreds of pages or thousands of pages long. It looked like [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2045.12s)]
*  it was three pieces of blank paper that fell on the floor. And just think about that scene. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2050.64s)]
*  Donald Trump drops him on the floor. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has to bend down [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2055.2s)]
*  on his knees in front of Donald Trump and crawl like a toddler to pick up the pieces of paper. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2060.8799999999997s)]
*  While Donald's like, oh, and then Keir Starmer's like, those papers are quite important. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2068.56s)]
*  And I'm watching this and I'm like, what the hell is happening? And the only thing that that even [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2076.3999999999996s)]
*  relates to is giving preferential treatment to Rolls Royce, Bentley and Land Rover over American [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2080.48s)]
*  auto manufacturers. So I don't consider that a trade deal. Okay. I've seen trade deals. That's [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2087.36s)]
*  not a trade deal. Maybe a memorandum of understanding that gave the UK benefits on their automobile [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2091.92s)]
*  industry. And certainly we don't have a trade deal with China. We just imposed 145% tariffs and [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2097.52s)]
*  then reduced them to 30% then added them back to 55%. Okay. So that's not a trade deal. Brett, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2103.36s)]
*  you said that one of the issues, like when you listen to Prime Minister Ashiba of Japan or the [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2109.44s)]
*  European Union, Van der Leyen or just whoever, they go, we don't even know what the hell the [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2114.48s)]
*  Americans are saying. Like we don't know. We don't know. We don't even understand the words that [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2119.12s)]
*  there's what is it that you're asking us for? Like we can't negotiate with people who we don't even [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2124.7200000000003s)]
*  know. But Brett, the other point is that how do you negotiate with people who breach the deals? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2130.16s)]
*  When it comes to Iran, Donald Trump's the one who pulled out of Obama's nuclear deal. That didn't [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2136.88s)]
*  just involve the United States. It involved a lot of our allies in the G7. It also brought in China [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2143.36s)]
*  and Russia. It had a lot of control mechanisms and Donald Trump breached that agreement. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2149.36s)]
*  So I'll go further than that. I'll go further than that for a second, right? Because you could say, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2154.96s)]
*  oh, but that was Obama's deal. So this is going to be his deal. So he'll obviously stick to it. Well, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2159.04s)]
*  may I present to you the USMCA, the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal that we did, that Trump did in his first [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2163.68s)]
*  term, that he now has literally said, I think a couple of times, he's been like, whoever did [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2169.04s)]
*  that deal is an idiot. He will like say things. It's like, you did the deal, actually. You're the [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2173.04s)]
*  one who did that deal and you blew it up. And there's countless examples. Trump did the trade [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2177.2799999999997s)]
*  deal with Japan. So when he's now negotiating with Japan and saying it's a horrible deal, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2182.72s)]
*  you're like, that was your deal. What is it that you want us to do? And then you ask, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2189.44s)]
*  of all of the bad faith and all of the things that he's doing and all of the fake deals, though, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2196.32s)]
*  he's been asked, what is the deal you're most proud of? Because our corporate media here treats [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2201.28s)]
*  him like a toddler and they don't care about accountability. It's like, Donald, Donald, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2208.08s)]
*  of all of the amazing deals he's done, he's done zero deals and everything he's done has been [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2215.12s)]
*  wrong. What would you say is the deal that makes you the proudest? And he lives in this fantasy [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2220.0s)]
*  world. It would be like, Ben, what is your greatest accomplishment that you've done over the past year? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2226.2400000000002s)]
*  And I was like, it's easy. The past accomplishment was I ran five marathons and I did them in record [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2232.96s)]
*  time. And it was incredible. I beat the fastest runners in the United States. There was nobody [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2241.04s)]
*  faster than me. And it was an incredible achievement. And then after I ran my last marathon, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2247.52s)]
*  I did a speech in front of a crowd. It was so big, 50,000 people showed up. And the speech was so [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2254.16s)]
*  good that they're going to award me a Nobel Peace Prize, they say. They say the committee's already [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2261.6s)]
*  voting on it. And they said the speech you've done was so good. And they said, you know what, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2265.92s)]
*  we're thinking about giving you two Nobel Peace Prizes. It's easy to just make random things up. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2270.72s)]
*  But Donald Trump is doing that where the counterparty is like India. They have like a [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2279.12s)]
*  billion people and the ramifications are real. So Donald Trump says the best deal he's made so far [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2284.64s)]
*  is that when it's come to the brief war between India and Pakistan following the terrorist attacks [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2292.0s)]
*  in Kashmir, Donald Trump said he negotiated himself the ceasefire. He mediated the ceasefire. He brought [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2298.8s)]
*  the parties together. He dangled trade in front of them and said, hey, India, hey, Pakistan, you want [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2305.28s)]
*  to do some trade with the United States, become friends. They became friends. And Donald Trump [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2311.84s)]
*  did it. He should thus get a Nobel Peace Prize. That's what Donald Trump has said. And this has [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2317.84s)]
*  pissed off India. Really hasn't pissed off Pakistan that much because for Pakistan, they've put [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2322.6400000000003s)]
*  money into Donald Trump's family crypto business. And then they got an invite to the White House. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2328.48s)]
*  Did you know on Tuesday, it was a Tuesday or Wednesday, the thing was Wednesday, the chief of [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2334.64s)]
*  the Pakistan army was quietly in the White House meeting with Donald Trump. Pretty soon after they [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2340.16s)]
*  put money in a crypto company owned by owned by the Trumps, Modi did not show up at the White House. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2347.28s)]
*  Modi called Donald Trump because Modi, the prime minister of India and Trump, were supposed to [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2353.28s)]
*  meet at the G7 on Tuesday. Donald Trump was supposed to meet with Zelensky and President [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2358.32s)]
*  Claudia Sheinbaum and Prime Minister Aishiba of Japan and others as well. But Trump was too scared [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2363.28s)]
*  to meet them. And Modi's been absolutely pissed. You didn't do that deal. It's infringing on India's [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2369.04s)]
*  sovereignty. And so India's foreign minister had to give an address to the people of India [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2374.88s)]
*  communicating the 35 minute call about what went down and what Modi had to tell Trump. Here, play [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2382.1600000000003s)]
*  this clip. I think the deal I'm most proud of is the fact that we're dealing with India. We're [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2387.92s)]
*  dealing with Pakistan and we were able to stop potentially a nuclear war through trade as opposed [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2392.48s)]
*  through bullets. You know, normally they do it through bullets. We do it through trade. So [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2398.48s)]
*  I'm very proud of that. Prime Minister Modi clearly told President Trump that during this [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2403.84s)]
*  entire episode, there was never any discussion at any level about an India-U.S. trade deal or [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2412.24s)]
*  U.S. mediation between India and Pakistan. The discussion to halt military action occurred [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2421.52s)]
*  directly between India and Pakistan through existing channels between both armies and was [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2429.2799999999997s)]
*  made at Pakistan's request. Prime Minister Modi family stated that India has neither accepted [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2436.48s)]
*  mediation nor does it do so and never will do. There is complete political unanimity on this [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2445.44s)]
*  subject in India. President Trump understood the details explained by the Prime Minister [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2454.2400000000002s)]
*  and expressed support for India's fight against terrorism. Prime Minister Modi also said [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2462.16s)]
*  that India now sees terrorism not as a proxy war but as a war. That's what Donald Trump said was [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2469.6s)]
*  his greatest accomplishment was a deal that the Prime Minister of India saying, stop saying you [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2478.24s)]
*  did a deal. You didn't do a deal. And everybody in the international community is just mocking him [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2484.48s)]
*  and they're laughing at him. And at the G7, they were laughing at him and they were all talking [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2490.56s)]
*  about, oh, you're doing social media posts now, Macron. They were just laughing and mocking Donald [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2495.44s)]
*  Trump in his absence. Going back to the example that I gave, you know, the kid who leaves the [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2501.2799999999997s)]
*  sleepover or leaves the party early and calls mommy and has to leave. It's kind of like that. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2506.0s)]
*  And then everybody's like making fun of the kid who left. You know, that's what they were doing [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2511.2s)]
*  to Trump at the G7. The guy left. What's wrong with this guy? And just think about it like this. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2515.92s)]
*  Trump's lied and claimed that Xi Jinping had phone conversations with him before they ever spoke. And [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2523.52s)]
*  Donald Trump's like, I told Xi Jinping, don't be embarrassed that you've called me. It's okay. You [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2529.6s)]
*  have nothing to be ashamed about. And then China had to keep saying, there's no conversations. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2534.88s)]
*  They're not talking. What are they even talking about? And then Donald Trump's like [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2539.6800000000003s)]
*  making up. He's like, the Ayatollah wants to come to the White House. He wants to meet me [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2545.44s)]
*  right here in the White House. And here, I'll show you what Trump said. And then Iran, through their [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2550.2400000000002s)]
*  UN delegation, had to respond. And they're like, no, we don't want to come to the White House. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2556.48s)]
*  We have no interest in being there. We're not going to negotiate under threats. But here's [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2561.84s)]
*  what Donald Trump said about the Ayatollah wanting to come to the White House. In the end, they [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2567.44s)]
*  decided not to do it. And now they wish they did it. And they want to meet, but it's a little late [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2572.16s)]
*  to meet, but they want to meet. And they want to come to the White House. So they can come to the [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2578.48s)]
*  White House. So we'll see. I may do that. But it's a shame it wasn't, could have been done the easy way. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2582.3999999999996s)]
*  You know, it's a shame that I find myself thinking the Ayatollah is probably right when it comes to [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2590.48s)]
*  who's telling the truth in this situation about coming to the White House. And as an American, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2598.0s)]
*  as between the guy there with Donald Trump who's speaking with the Juventus Italian football club [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2605.6s)]
*  behind him, I don't know, people on audio, you can't see it, but to our viewers, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2614.8s)]
*  there's a football team for Americans, a soccer club, randomly standing behind Donald Trump as he [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2619.52s)]
*  tries to bait them later on in that press conference to make anti-trans remarks. And they [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2626.32s)]
*  did not take the bait. But he's speaking with Juventus. And he's again, just saying, you know, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2632.32s)]
*  the same type of Oval Office press conference where Donald Trump claims that there's a genocide [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2639.6000000000004s)]
*  taking place against white South African Africaners, you know, directly. And then Ramaphosa, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2644.0800000000004s)]
*  the president of South Africa brings the white agriculture minister from the party, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2651.12s)]
*  like represents the white Africaners. And Ramaphosa is like, do you think that this [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2656.56s)]
*  white guy would be here, Donald, if we're doing a genocide against the white? He's here, speak, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2662.24s)]
*  white guy. And then the agriculture minister is like, yeah, I'm a white guy. We're not being [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2666.88s)]
*  genocided here. We don't know what you're talking about. And then the people at South Africa are [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2672.32s)]
*  like, yeah, we think you're crazy. There's violence. There's issues with raids against [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2677.28s)]
*  farms that affect black South Africans and white South Africans. But the guy's a loon. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2682.32s)]
*  Trump's a loon. We're dealing with an actual lunatic. Again, that's why I started the episode [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2687.2000000000003s)]
*  with the E. Jean Carroll clip, because again, we're dealing with someone who's always a liar, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2693.6800000000003s)]
*  who's a fraud, who's a sexual abuser, you know, who's a crap human being. And it just, it just [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2700.32s)]
*  sucks. Not just as an American. You know, when, when you have Xi Jinping, you know, making these [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2706.56s)]
*  comments and seeming like a more responsible actor than Donald Trump, that's crazy as an American [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2712.24s)]
*  to have to be like that. But when I follow the objective data and I'm saying who based on what [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2718.7999999999997s)]
*  we know right now, who's probably more accurately telling the truth in this specific situation [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2725.36s)]
*  by looking at the external data, what a horrible observation to even have to make in a situation [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2731.84s)]
*  like this. And I want to talk about, and I want to turn to as well. Let me show you this clip first [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2739.36s)]
*  though too, where Donald Trump, again, with Juventus football club in the background, okay, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2746.4s)]
*  that's where he decides to say this, how he doesn't want to ceasefire at all. And that he wants [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2751.6800000000003s)]
*  unconditional surrender, unconditional victory against Iran here playing this clip. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2757.44s)]
*  We have a very quick women's team though. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2787.44s)]
*  We do have, right? But they should be. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2789.84s)]
*  That was, do we have the other clip right by any chance? Where Trump says it's with there. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2793.28s)]
*  He says we don't want ceasefire. Do we happen to have another clip? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2797.52s)]
*  The president, Emmanuel Macron in France the other day, the G7. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2800.64s)]
*  He's a nice guy. Look, he said I was going back home to make a [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2804.7200000000003s)]
*  ceasefire, not a ceasefire. We'll long be on ceasefire. And I said, why do you say that? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2810.32s)]
*  Why would you say ceasefire? It's a bad term to use because a ceasefire means like everything's [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2817.52s)]
*  going swimmingly. We'll take a little time off. It's not, we're not looking for a ceasefire. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2822.16s)]
*  We're looking for a total complete victory. Again, you know what the victory is. No nuclear weapon. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2826.48s)]
*  I thought it was a very badly worded statement by him. And obviously I let him know that. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2835.2000000000003s)]
*  On the southern border, you've had record. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2839.44s)]
*  Wouldn't you want a ceasefire to then negotiate a denuclearization? And if you're [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2842.0s)]
*  making social media posts like unconditional surrender, exclamation point, and saying we're [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2848.96s)]
*  going to kill like in kills in cap, exclamation point, the Ayatollah, I just, it would surprise [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2855.92s)]
*  me then that the Ayatollah would say, you know what? I want to come to the White House. I want [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2863.12s)]
*  to see those big polls of yours that you are putting up on the north and south lawn. And just [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2868.4s)]
*  think about that scene as Donald Trump's actual poll numbers are plummeting. And as Donald Trump [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2874.64s)]
*  is so insecure about his own inadequacies, he has to erect gigantic polls in the White House that [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2882.32s)]
*  look like an eyesore in front of it. I want to talk about that. I want to talk about the situation [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=2892.2400000000002s)]

*  in a war with the Houthis in Yemen that America lost, and American media doesn't provide [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3269.9199999999996s)]
*  any reporting on that fact. We just hear Pete Hegseth wear his stupid camloff while wearing [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3278.72s)]

*  Houthis. It pains me to say that, but it's just the reality. What was the mission? Why were we [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3291.68s)]
*  targeting the Houthis in the first place? Because American commercial vessels were not able to [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3298.0s)]
*  transverse or travel through the Red Sea because of Houthi strikes on American commercial vessels. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3304.24s)]
*  So the success of this mission, which was an actual real war, although it wasn't called that, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3311.44s)]
*  was to allow American commercial vessels back in the Red Sea and to allow United States [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3316.72s)]
*  military to make strategic strikes on the Houthis to allow that to take place. Well, America lost [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3323.68s)]
*  two F-18 Hornets in the region that mysteriously disappeared. We never got a good explanation of [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3329.9199999999996s)]
*  what happened. It was like, they fell off the ship. Okay. And then we lost seven Reaper drones [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3337.4399999999996s)]
*  above Yemen, seven Reaper drones at least, and it could potentially be more. And then remember [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3344.4s)]
*  before the commercial break where Donald Trump said, why would I do a ceasefire? Like as those [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3350.7200000000003s)]
*  ceasefires are just bad and show weakness and are pathetic, it's got to be unconditional surrender [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3355.36s)]
*  and victory. Well, remember back on May 7th, 2025, what Donald Trump said about the Houthis? And [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3361.6800000000003s)]
*  there's a lot of news and a lot of distractions out there, but remember Donald Trump said that we [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3367.92s)]
*  entered into a ceasefire with the Houthis. He called them honorable people about six times in [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3372.8s)]
*  this press conference. He called the terrorist group, the Houthis, honorable people. And he said [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3378.32s)]
*  how much he respects their word and he trusts that. And you respect the word and you trust the [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3383.92s)]
*  Houthis and notice what he says. And he goes, and we will be able to have our commercial vessels now [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3389.6800000000003s)]
*  in the Red Sea, mission accomplished. So watch what he does on May 7th, play this clip. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3395.76s)]
*  Take a look. But you know, we had really a very good, as you know, we had a very good [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3400.3199999999997s)]
*  outcome with the Houthis and we honor their word. I mean, they made a commitment and we dealt with [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3407.7599999999998s)]
*  other countries that were close to them and their surrogates and we honor all of their words. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3416.0s)]
*  We'll see what happens, but I think, you know, I believe that hopefully that's over with [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3421.8399999999997s)]
*  and they'll leave the ships alone, you know, just leave those ships alone. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3427.52s)]
*  But so we do, we take their word for it. It was, you know, we hit them very hard. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3432.32s)]
*  They had a great capacity to withstand punishment. They took tremendous punishment. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3436.72s)]
*  And, you know, you could say there's a lot of bravery there. It was amazing what they took, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3443.12s)]
*  but we honor their commitment and their word. They gave us their word that they wouldn't be [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3451.04s)]

*  former Fox host Pete Hegseth was recently on Capitol Hill in, you know, this was what mid [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3478.72s)]
*  to late June now. And he was asked by democratic Congress member, Seth Moulton. Congress member [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3484.24s)]
*  Moulton has been on the Midas Touch network numerous times. I've interviewed him. He's a [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3490.16s)]
*  veteran. He did four tours of duty in Iraq. He knows his stuff. He asks Hegseth, how many American [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3494.24s)]
*  commercial vessels since then have been able to be in the Red Sea? The answer is zero. Now watch [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3503.36s)]
*  Hegseth, like the weasel that he is, try to pretend that there was a victory. But these are losers. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3509.76s)]
*  Again, I'm not trying to get political. I'm talking about character. Trump, Hegseth, the whole crew of [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3516.6400000000003s)]

*  operation. About how much money did it cost? How much money did you spend on missiles shooting at [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3530.72s)]
*  the Houthis? Well, you'd have to compare that with what it cost. I'm just asking how many, how much did [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3535.6s)]
*  it cost? Divert our shipping lanes around. I'm told it's several hundred million dollars, maybe close to [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3539.8399999999997s)]
*  a billion dollars. How many U.S. flagged commercial ships have transited the Red Sea since your so-called [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3544.3199999999997s)]

*  Military vessels transited. No, no, no, I didn't ask about military vessels. I asked about commercial [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3554.24s)]
*  vessels. How many commercial vessels? It's been several weeks. How many commercial vessels U.S. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3559.1200000000003s)]

*  kids in school who didn't do their homework, who didn't prepare, you know, who think that they're [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3576.0s)]

*  And you saw Donald Trump claim commercial vessels would be in the Red Sea and you saw Hegseth try to [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3610.4s)]
*  wiggle out of it. And remember, this is where our classified information was put in signal chats [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3615.92s)]
*  about the operation. I don't know, maybe the Houthis had access to that classified information. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3622.56s)]
*  Maybe the reason that seven Reaper drones and two F-18s were decimated, you know, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3631.2000000000003s)]

*  we have here in the United States lies to us over and over again, because I'll tell you where they're [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3644.56s)]
*  most comfortable doing crap like this. They took down Hillary Clinton's portrait on the First Lady [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3649.76s)]
*  hallway in the White House. And you know what they replaced it with? A photo of Donald Trump's face [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3657.76s)]
*  as the American flag. So is Donald Trump saying that he's a First Lady? He's putting his weirdo [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3664.0s)]
*  It's funny framing. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3672.16s)]
*  Why would it go there? I mean, our audio listeners, congratulations that you don't have to even see [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3675.12s)]
*  what this photo looks like. You know, Donald Trump likes posting this now as he's going to golf. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3679.76s)]
*  This is what he posted an hour ago. Too many non-working holidays in America. It is costing [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3685.36s)]
*  our country billions of dollars to keep all these businesses closed. The workers don't want [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3690.72s)]
*  it either. Soon we'll end up having a holiday for every once working day of the year. It must change [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3695.3599999999997s)]
*  if we are going to make America great again. It's because Donald Trump is a racist and doesn't like [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3701.6s)]
*  Juneteenth and that that's now how he's messaging this. Like, that's his way of winking. As he's [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3707.68s)]
*  going to play golf while there could be on the verge of World War III or nuclear chaos breaking [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3713.6s)]

*  word. In the next 24 to 48 hours, Iran can have a nuclear weapon and they're preparing to direct [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3728.08s)]
*  it at New York. That's what they've been saying, that there will be mushroom clouds in New York. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3734.3199999999997s)]
*  We need to take action immediately, urgently. But first, Donald Trump's got to golf. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3739.04s)]
*  Two weeks needs to pass and then maybe another two weeks. Then maybe he compounds the two weeks and [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3746.08s)]
*  merges it with the trade deadlines. Then maybe, I don't know, maybe he'll start talking to the [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3751.6800000000003s)]
*  Ayatollah about tariffs. Or maybe the Ayatollah buys some Trump crypto and works with the Pakistanis [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3757.6800000000003s)]
*  and then buys Trump crypto. Maybe that's why the chief of staff of the Pakistan army was there [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3764.96s)]
*  representing the Ayatollah to talk about a crypto. Who the hell knows what these idiots are doing, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3770.8s)]
*  but we are a country run by idiots right now. Absolute, complete, and total idiots [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3777.36s)]
*  right now is what's going on. And just take a look at the stagflation warning that's taking place [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3785.52s)]
*  right now. According to the Fed, they are now predicting a brutal mix for 2025. Inflation up [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3790.4s)]
*  to 3%, growth down to 1.4%, unemployment up to 4.5%. They're holding interest rates steady for now. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3797.36s)]
*  They still expect two cuts this year, but there were supposed to be a lot more cuts and earlier [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3805.36s)]
*  cuts had Donald Trump just did nothing and not declare a trade war against the world. I think [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3811.52s)]
*  we have this clip of Donald Trump with construction workers behind him where Trump is asked, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3817.68s)]
*  is the U.S. moving closer to striking Iranian nuclear facilities? And this is when Donald Trump [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3824.96s)]
*  was showing the big polls he's putting up in the North and South Lawn. I just want you to listen [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3832.0s)]
*  to his response right here and how he talks about this. As I play this, I want you to think about [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3838.3199999999997s)]
*  the speeches of the FDRs and the Truman's and the Eisenhower's and the JFKs, right? You know, Obama. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3845.68s)]
*  And we're talking about war. We're talking about potential nuclear war. And here's how Donald Trump [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3856.0s)]
*  frames the issue when he's asked about, is America going to get potentially involved in World War [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3863.36s)]
*  III? Here's his response. Let's play. Will you strike the Iranian nuclear component? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3868.4s)]
*  And what time exactly, sir? Sir, would you strike it? Would you please inform us so we can be there [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3874.08s)]
*  and watch? I mean, you don't know that I'm going to even do it. You don't know. I may do it. I may [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3879.84s)]
*  not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do. I can tell you this. I may do it. I may not [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3884.56s)]
*  do it. I don't know. Let me speak to these construction workers behind me who I'm using [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3890.08s)]
*  as props. Can you believe it? I started off with a press conference with Juventus. Randomly, I have [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3894.96s)]
*  the Italian football club standing behind me as I talk about nuclear war. And then I start telling [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3902.2400000000002s)]
*  them, you guys believe the Democrats want to turn everybody transgender? Transgender for everybody? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3908.4s)]
*  What the hell? Transgender for everybody? What weirdo dystopian sick world do these people [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3914.48s)]

*  talks about golfing? So now he's going golfing, but here's the clip where he was longing and whining [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3942.4s)]
*  about how much he hasn't been able to golf lately because he's had to deal with work as he basically [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3951.36s)]

*  Because if you lift it up from one, you have to lift it from the bottom. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3981.36s)]
*  But you have to get it there. But if you lifted it from without that, the whole thing would split. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=3986.64s)]

*  of the things that he does here is, at all these press briefings now, you have kind of the corporate [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4108.32s)]
*  press, you got a few of them, you know, still in the room. And then you got a bunch of these, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4114.48s)]

*  all in. That's quite the lead to a question. What's your message to everyday Trump supporters, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4160.4s)]
*  not not the Tucker Carlson's or the big names, but everyday Trump supporters, [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4167.28s)]
*  grassroots who voted for President Trump to stop the wars, rejected this in the primary, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4171.76s)]
*  going into another war with voting against Nikki Haley. And they want to see non-US involvement in [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4177.68s)]
*  this war. What's your message? Trust in President Trump. President Trump has incredible instincts [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4184.64s)]
*  and President Trump kept America and the world safe in his first term and as president and [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4190.56s)]
*  implement. All right, you get it. This is we live in North Korea right now. Okay, like you see that, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4196.400000000001s)]
*  right? The person who asked the question and asked the question, Rhino War Monger, Lindsey Graham, [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4202.0s)]
*  that's how he began his question, which was even a little too much for Caroline Levitt, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4208.4800000000005s)]
*  who was like, oh, that's quite the way to start the question. Maybe hide it a little better [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4212.64s)]
*  next time. Then her question, trust on President Trump. He's all knowing he is great. This is what [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4215.84s)]
*  we're dealing with right now. So on the one hand, we have a very complicit kind of mainstream press [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4220.56s)]
*  who's by the way, much better than that. Okay, I'm going to be very clear about that. I'll take [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4224.8s)]
*  them any day over whatever the hell that was. And then you got these people in there and you got [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4229.04s)]
*  these people covering it. So my message as we sort of wrap things up here is remain vigilant out [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4233.6s)]
*  there. Understand that the information that's coming to you from a lot of these sources may [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4238.16s)]
*  be packaged as views, a lot of it's bullshit, a lot of it's propaganda. And so it becomes harder [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4242.16s)]
*  and harder to sift through it. I think one of our jobs that we view, one of the things we view as [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4248.0s)]
*  our jobs here is to sift through it and to try to find the real stories. What's actually going on [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4252.72s)]
*  here with the Houthis, what's actually going on with the India Pakistan situation, what's actually [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4257.2s)]
*  going on in Iran. It's not easy and we're going to get it wrong sometimes for sure, but we're going [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4263.2s)]
*  to always try to figure out the truth in that. I even had some folks reach out to us from Japan, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4267.68s)]
*  Japan listeners, the Midas Touch podcast, Japanese listeners. And they said, thank you so much for [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4273.200000000001s)]
*  showing that clip of the Indian foreign minister because even in my country here, they were [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4278.96s)]
*  reporting what Trump said, that Trump was the person who did that deal between India and Pakistan. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4284.320000000001s)]
*  So thanks for clearing that up for me. And I think we just all need to constantly be shining light on [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4289.200000000001s)]
*  this darkness that we are seeing here, Geordie. I put the hat on because you know I'm about to [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4293.68s)]
*  get serious. Oh no. Caroline Levitt said, kept America safe like he did under his first presidency. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4299.4400000000005s)]
*  There were mobile morgues under Donald Trump's first presidency. Millions of people lost their [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4307.84s)]
*  lives under Donald Trump's first presidency. Mobile morgues kept America safe under Donald [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4319.12s)]
*  Trump's first presidency. Well, he said like a miracle, it was all going to go like a miracle. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4326.96s)]
*  And that's what I wanted. In two weeks, it's going to go away like a miracle. Again, another two weeks, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4330.64s)]
*  it's just going to go away. You know what? Unfriggin' believable what we witnessed day in [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIY9j0vt_IE&t=4336.16s)]
