# FURIOUS Canada CHECKMATES Trump and PREPARES ARMY
**MeidasTouch:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk)
*  World leaders are furious at the Trump regime and the United States and they're also in disbelief, but also mocking what the United States has become. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to let you know what world leaders are doing. Then I want to focus on how furious Canada is as well. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=12.0s)]
*  And I talked about this yesterday, but I want to talk about it again. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=17.0s)]
*  The Canadian European Union Joint Defense Pact that was arranged before the NATO summit and the import there. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=21.0s)]
*  We saw Ireland's labor leader on the floor of their parliament holding up a photo of a baby bald JD Vance. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=29.0s)]
*  Because apparently this is one of the reasons that a Norwegian tourist, 21 years old, was refused entry to the United States and deported after ICE found that meme on the phone. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=41.0s)]
*  Now after that went viral, the Department of Homeland Security said, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=55.0s)]
*  It was for a lot of other reasons. But wait a minute. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=60.0s)]
*  The United States Embassy in all countries right now is issuing a warning that if you travel into the United States and you have your social media on private, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=64.0s)]
*  that there could be serious repercussions because the Trump regime wants to go through everybody who enters, anybody who wants a visa. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=76.0s)]
*  They're going to go through your social media. They're going to go through your direct messages to make sure it comports and is compliant with the regime. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=85.0s)]
*  I mean, they said that that's what they're going to do. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=93.0s)]
*  So I'm not sure why they're denying that the baby Vance meme is not the reason. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=96.0s)]
*  But here's what happened when the Ireland Labour leader went to the house, went to their floor of parliament. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=101.0s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=107.0s)]
*  Unthinkable in a Western democracy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=109.0s)]
*  This week, a young Norwegian tourist detained by ICE at Newark Airport and sent back to Oslo. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=111.0s)]
*  Why? He had this meme on his phone, Minister, a meme depicting Vice President JD Vance as a baby. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=117.0s)]
*  I mean, extraordinary, extraordinary that a young person with this amusing meme on their phone depicting a public person, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=124.0s)]
*  that this would be used as an excuse to detain him for five hours and then deport him back to Oslo. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=131.0s)]
*  So, Minister, I welcome the Tánasdh commitment to raise this serious issue with the US ambassador. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=136.0s)]
*  But as the line minister for issuing visas, what can you do to reassure young people here who hope to travel to the US on a J1 visa but are fearful of this treatment? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=142.0s)]
*  There's very little I can do about the US immigration system. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=151.0s)]
*  Like I'm trying to put rules in the Irish immigration system. I can't control the US immigration system. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=154.0s)]
*  I think it is regrettable that these new measures are being introduced by the United States. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=160.0s)]
*  I welcome the fact that the Tánasdh and the Taoiseach have indicated that they think it's inappropriate. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=165.0s)]
*  We mentioned this with the US authorities. Hundreds of thousands, probably millions of Irish people have a great time on J1 visas. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=170.0s)]
*  They're still doing it this year. They've done it in the past. I think it will continue into the future. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=177.0s)]
*  You think so? You think that it's just going to everyone's arriving here and just having a jolly all time. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=182.0s)]
*  Anyway, here I just want to remind everybody Prime Minister Carney at the EU Canada Summit that they held on the side of the NATO Summit. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=188.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Carney talks about moving beyond the past and into the future, which is obviously a reference to goodbye United States. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=197.0s)]
*  So we're meeting now in that context in, as you just said, in hard times. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=205.0s)]
*  We might say even a hinge moment of history, a world that's more dangerous and divided. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=211.0s)]
*  A time where the rules based international, the global order, rules based global order is under threat in a time when technological change is accelerating. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=217.0s)]
*  And we really have two choices. It's a jurisdiction as a country in this circumstance. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=228.0s)]
*  We can nostalgically look back and long for the old order to somehow return or we can build a new one with purpose and partnership. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=234.0s)]
*  And as the most European of the non-European countries, Canada looks first to the European Union to build a better world. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=244.0s)]
*  And that's what today is about. It's about building on our triple alignment of values of interests and of trust, trust built over the years. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=254.0s)]
*  And so today this is a new era of cooperation. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=263.0s)]
*  Our strategic Canada EU or EU Canada Strategic Partnership for the future will build a new and deeper relationship that brings us closer together from defense to digital, from supply chains to security. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=268.0s)]
*  We're launching comprehensive negotiations across multiple areas of cooperation, connection, trade, security, digital climate. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=283.0s)]
*  And this will make us both more resilient and more more prosperous. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=293.0s)]
*  In many respects, what we're committing to from our perspective, Canada's perspective, is an ongoing process to an ever closer partnership that will bring our people closer together. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=299.0s)]
*  I want to bring on a former member of parliament from Canada, Charlie Angus. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=312.0s)]
*  Charlie Angus of the Resistance Tour. It's good to see you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=317.0s)]
*  I want to get your reaction. I want to get your reaction to what we just saw in Donald Trump's, whatever you want to call it, whatever that happened, NATO. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=320.0s)]
*  Well, this week, I think, was extraordinary. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=330.0s)]
*  I don't think it's being played up in the Canadian media because the significance of it seems to be missing people. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=334.0s)]
*  So first off, we have Donald Trump showing up at NATO, refusing to commit to Article 5, which is the defense of countries under threat. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=340.0s)]
*  And everybody knows who those threats are against Canada and Greenland. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=348.0s)]
*  He says he's there and talks about Putin, which is completely undermining Ukraine. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=352.0s)]
*  And then he goes and bombs Iran, totally blindsided the allies. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=358.0s)]
*  So we had two responses that are very indicative of the times when we had Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, tweeting and sending out text messages about how extraordinary it was that Donald Trump basically unilaterally decided to bomb another country on behalf of Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=365.0s)]
*  And then he referred to Trump as daddy. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=384.0s)]
*  Whose daddy is this guy that we are all sort of the bad children of Donald Trump. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=387.0s)]
*  So I think that's left a really bad taste in the mouth of people who are like Mark Rutte wants Canada give 5% of our gross domestic product for him to decide about spending on military. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=393.0s)]
*  So that was the one response. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=406.0s)]
*  But you compare that to Mark Carney's meeting and public statements with the EU. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=408.0s)]
*  It's extraordinary what they were talking about. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=413.0s)]
*  First off, the EU didn't undermine or attack Canada for our commitments. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=415.0s)]
*  We were we provided more support for Ukraine per capita than anyone in the G7. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=420.0s)]
*  We've been on the front lines in Latvia. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=425.0s)]
*  But this wasn't just about defense. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=427.0s)]
*  They were talking about bringing Canada very much in line with the EU on our values. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=429.0s)]
*  And some of those the references were were total marks against mega that they talked about. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=436.0s)]
*  They talked about they were both Canada and the EU were going to defend economic or academic and scientific freedom. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=443.0s)]
*  That's a message to all the scientists, the medical researchers, the academics were being hunted down and chased out of universities by Maga. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=450.0s)]
*  Imagine if Canada and the EU start saying bringing all these research refugees and welcoming them in. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=459.0s)]
*  They talked about Juno Beach, the Canadian D-Day, but then talked about it in terms of fighting climate change. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=465.0s)]
*  We know that Maga and Maga Maple are absolute climate denialists totally all in on the big oil agenda. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=471.0s)]
*  Mark Carney and the EU were talking about a value system that is completely at odds with Donald Trump's America. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=477.0s)]
*  So when he talked about a hinge moment of history, I think we're watching something extraordinary happen. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=485.0s)]
*  Talk to us now about the fallout of the U.S. strikes on Iran. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=491.0s)]
*  You have Donald Trump declaring total obliteration despite the fact that all of the intelligence in the U.S. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=498.0s)]
*  from CENTCOM and from the Pentagon suggests to the contrary that the objective was not achieved. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=506.0s)]
*  And now Donald Trump is saying if you say the objective was not achieved, you are attacking the fighter pilots who are getting very sad right now [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=513.0s)]
*  because you are being mean to them as though the fighter pilots are there playing. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=522.0s)]
*  Please, please don't be mean to me. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=526.0s)]
*  But to me, it projects kind of total and utter weakness. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=529.0s)]
*  Again, it looks like Trump is so thirsty for deals. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=534.0s)]
*  I need a deal. I need a deal that he gets himself into the problems, wants a deal right away, creates bigger problems, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=537.0s)]
*  doesn't even achieve the objectives that he sets out by his own terms, and then moves on to the next one. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=545.0s)]
*  It's just the the pied piper of just ridiculousness. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=551.0s)]
*  What do you make of it all? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=556.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I think Mark Carney, I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=558.0s)]
*  I've spent 20 plus years in Parliament and I've heard really great vision statements. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=562.0s)]
*  And the one thing I've learned is all those vision statements usually don't amount to very much. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=566.0s)]
*  This seems to be different. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=570.0s)]
*  I think in the kind of key language when Carney and the EU talk about the international rules based order, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=572.0s)]
*  when they talk about the moral obligations of the West, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=579.0s)]
*  I think what they're talking about is the fact that Donald Trump went all in on Benjamin Netanyahu's forever war. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=583.0s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu is under indictment as an international war criminal, just like Vladimir Putin is. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=590.0s)]
*  Trump swore in the media. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=596.0s)]
*  And you saw again the secretary general of NATO running to the defense of Trump. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=600.0s)]
*  But what you see from Carney and their very careful language with the EU is that they don't want to be anywhere near this guy right now. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=609.0s)]
*  The fact that he went and unilaterally bombed Iran and then panicked and did the general talk [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=618.0s)]
*  and then demanded everyone stop fighting after he did this, after he declared regime change, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=623.0s)]
*  shows the increasing instability in terms of how the United States is being looked upon. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=628.0s)]
*  So everything that you saw in terms of the meetings with the EU and Carney was very much about we've got to get out from under this guy. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=634.0s)]
*  We've got to set our own terms. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=644.0s)]
*  We're not going to do it in a way that we're going to publicly say that this guy is a dangerous, unhinged, narcissistic lunatic. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=646.0s)]
*  But I think in terms of what the diplomatic language is coming out right now from Carney in the EU is that they're done with this guy. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=655.0s)]
*  They're done with having to placate and go along with and be happy sock puppets to irresponsible, dangerous international actions. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=662.0s)]
*  It could lead us into much, much more violent situations in an already violent region. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=672.0s)]
*  So let's see where this goes. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=677.0s)]
*  But I actually think and again, I've never been known to suck up to government language. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=680.0s)]
*  But when we talk about a hinge of history, we are actually on the hinge right now and we are moving into a different era. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=687.0s)]
*  And the United States is being left behind in a significant manner. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=692.0s)]
*  So, Charlie, I always ask you this question when we wrap up these interviews, which is we know the Trump regime has a whole team of people who watch this network. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=696.0s)]
*  They've threatened us before. They'll threaten us again. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=706.0s)]
*  Don't care. But if they're watching it, if Donald Trump's watching this right now, what's your message to him? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=709.0s)]
*  Well, Donald, you've proven yourself. Your General Tacco. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=716.0s)]
*  I mean, you risked a complete escalation of a dangerous situation by pouring gasoline all over the arson of Benjamin Netanyahu in the situation in Iran. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=720.0s)]
*  And then you panicked. You went to NATO and you shouted and hollered. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=732.0s)]
*  But what you saw is that the allies are talking about a value system that you do not understand, a value system about human rights, which you do not support, a value system about the rule of law, which you are actively undermining, a value system about academic freedom and support for scientific region. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=737.0s)]
*  While you've got anti-vax lunatic get grifter influencers taking over key positions and leaving the United States more and more isolated. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=755.0s)]
*  So, yeah, I can see why you're swearing at the media, Donald. It ain't looking good for you. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=764.0s)]
*  But what we're seeing now is that Canada is saying for the first time that its values are European. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=768.0s)]
*  Its values are with the people of Europe. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=777.0s)]
*  We've never said that before. We've always seen ourselves within the Americas. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=780.0s)]
*  But as long as you're there, Donald, we're not there with you. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=784.0s)]
*  You've just left yourself more isolated. You've left your country weaker. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=787.0s)]
*  You've left yourself looking like a sock puppet of Vladimir Putin at the G7 and at NATO and the rest of us. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=791.0s)]
*  We're moving on. So we know you're going to come back and you're going to threaten us again and you're going to tell us our 30 days are up and you're going to threaten this that and the other. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=798.0s)]
*  But what are the Europeans talking about? They're talking about a critical minerals deal with Canada. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=807.0s)]
*  Yeah, you need critical minerals. They're talking about expensive trade with Canada. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=811.0s)]
*  Yeah, because we have allies over there. Big economy. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=816.0s)]
*  Germany, France, the UK, Norway, all ready to work together because we share values and you have no values. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=820.0s)]
*  You know, when you say that, it gave me the chills because that's exactly what the statement was. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=828.0s)]
*  It was Canada saying we're European. That's what they said. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=834.0s)]
*  And we're not identifying with you anymore. United States of America. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=838.0s)]
*  I think that speech is going to go down in history. I'm with you. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=843.0s)]
*  I try not to think in hyperbolic language when I hear things like that. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=846.0s)]
*  But one of the biggest statements and speeches, I think, in geopolitics, we've seen Charlie. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=852.0s)]
*  Thanks for the work that you're doing. A reminder that Charlie and the resistance tour travels around Canada. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=857.0s)]
*  And it's always great to get the feedback of the Midas Mighty, as you say, from the mining towns to the towns on the water. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=865.0s)]
*  There's Midas Mighty from coast to coast in Canada. Thank you. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=874.0s)]

*  We're in this together. We all got to have each other's back because we are taking on in the age of fascism. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=888.0s)]
*  And we're going to be standing at the end of the day when Donald Trump is long gone. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP5YqESl1Pk&t=893.0s)]
