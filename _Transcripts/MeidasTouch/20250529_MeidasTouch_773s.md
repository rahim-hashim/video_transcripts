# Trump INSTANTLY LOSES AGAIN after DISASTER NIGHT
**MeidasTouch:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE)
*  I'm joined by California Governor Gavin Newsom. Governor, I want to get your reaction to these two [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=0.0s)]
*  federal court orders invalidating Trump's tariffs against the world. Yesterday, the U.S. Court of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=5.12s)]
*  International Trade granted summary judgment against Donald Trump. Earlier today, Judge [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=10.96s)]
*  Contreras blocked Trump's tariffs as unlawful. Your reaction, Governor? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=16.4s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's raining tacos today. I mean, it's not a good day for Donald Trump and his [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=20.72s)]
*  central economic program. These tariffs, which we've said from day one, California, as you know, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=25.52s)]
*  is on your show and privilege of sharing with you and your viewers, we were the first state to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=32.24s)]
*  introduce a lawsuit under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. And basically, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=38.16s)]
*  that judgment said exactly what we said in our brief. And so we're very, very pleased at this [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=45.04s)]
*  moment, this brief moment, that these tariffs have been thrown out. But the reality is the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=50.64s)]
*  federal administration, at least the Trump administration, is now moving to get a stay [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=56.88s)]
*  in federal courts. And I imagine they will be imposing potentially under different rubrics, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=61.36s)]
*  additional sanctions and poor taxes, which they can impose 15 percent over a 150-day period under [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=67.92s)]
*  the Trade Act. I imagine this is hardly the last we'll hear about tariffs under the Trump [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=74.48s)]
*  administration. I want to show this photo that you posted recently about how family businesses [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=80.0s)]
*  and our ports are literally paying the price for Trump's unlawful and disastrous tariffs. Governor, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=85.92s)]
*  can you give us a sense of what's going on today, May 29th, at the ports of Los Angeles [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=92.0s)]
*  and throughout California, actually? Yeah, I mean, the ports in LA, they saw 17 cancellations [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=98.0s)]
*  of vessels. They already have seen now, as we book in advance in June, 10 cancellations already [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=104.4s)]
*  that we're projecting in June. We had a 15 percent decline in May in the number of container ships [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  coming in to Oakland. We're seeing the price pressures. You're seeing that across the country. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  It impacts the small businesses disproportionately. That's why that D.C. Circuit Court decision today [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=124.4s)]
*  was so rewarding for small businesses. It was on behalf of two children's toy manufacturers, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=130.64s)]
*  and it was successful, again, very similar to the California case. And so this has already had an [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  impact, and the impacts would be even more acute as it relates to shortages and supply constraints [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  that are inevitable if this continues. So look, we're in this chaotic moment. It's self-inflicted [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=150.88s)]
*  by the Trump administration. That chaos continues. The damage has been done. We can't overstate or [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=156.56s)]
*  understate the impacts of the damage, but we have to, I think, at least applaud our courts. And [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=161.76s)]
*  remember that international court, which most people don't even know existed, it was a bipartisan. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=167.68s)]
*  You had a Trump appointee. You had a Reagan appointee. Yes, they're still around. And you had [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  a more recent appointee of a Democratic administration, and they were unanimous [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  in condemning the act, the unilateral decision under the IAECP that Trump advanced. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=185.04s)]
*  – You know, Governor, what's concerning though as well about what you're saying is [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=192.08s)]
*  when Donald Trump tacoed in Switzerland with China and caved on the 145% tariffs, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  brought him to 30% tariffs, I think there was some expectation that all of a sudden a light [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=202.88s)]
*  switch would turn on. He tacoed, light switch, ports returned to normal. That's not happening, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=208.56s)]
*  right? – No, and look, he continues to double down on stupid on this stuff. And we've seen it [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  over and over. He loses. He gets more angry. I mean, we could joke about the taco, but that frame, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=218.8s)]
*  that came from the financial times. People are literally making billions and billions and billions [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=224.16s)]
*  of dollars. The financial markets have anticipated Trump's incapacity to be consistent, to provide [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=228.4s)]
*  any stable rationale for his economic policies. They're chaotic. He changes them on a whim, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=235.52s)]
*  on a basis of a phone call. You could talk about crony capitalism in that frame. And he changes [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  them on the basis of where the markets are going. And people are gaming that out. And so this notion [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=248.8s)]
*  that he was challenged on that point in the White House yesterday and reacted to it with such [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  disdain only reinforces the likelihood that he'll react accordingly and consistently in this [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=261.92s)]
*  respect by overreacting to it. And that's why I think the next few hours and the next few days [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=267.52000000000004s)]
*  will be very interesting. And hardly is he going to, I think, shift course 180 degrees. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  – Let's talk about the people impact in the great state of California. How is this impacting [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=278.48s)]
*  the dock workers, the truckers? What are you seeing? There was a bad jobless claims report [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=284.16s)]
*  that exceeded expectations this morning nationally. Jobless claims rose 240,000 in the past week, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=290.88s)]
*  this on the first quarter economic contraction as well. So what are you making of all this? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=297.12s)]
*  – Yeah, I mean, they updated those numbers. And instead of 0.3% decline in GP, it's 0.2%. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=302.56s)]
*  The fact that we were growing 2.4% and now we're declining as an economy, the impact that's having [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=308.88s)]
*  in the aggregate, but you asked a specific question about small business. I've met with [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=315.12s)]
*  over a dozen small business members that literally it's complete chill, devastation. A young woman [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  who said, I had to look in the eyes of my eight-year-old and say, honey, you helped me [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=326.0s)]
*  inspire this business when you were a baby. It's a baby business, baby supplies. We just made a deal [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=330.88s)]
*  with Target and Walmart and I leveraged the home and I don't know if I can keep the home. That's real. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=336.48s)]
*  That's because of Trump's unilateral policies, illegal, but unilateral policies. I met with [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=344.0s)]
*  someone I personally bought for the holidays. I bought my son a bike and an electric component. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=349.84s)]
*  This guy, he said, thank you. I have your email because it was part of the receipt. I'm embarrassed [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=357.6s)]
*  to reach out to you. He literally just sent this to me. He goes, I have a whole supply container, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=361.92s)]
*  but I can't afford the tariffs in China. I literally, it's a family business. I cannot [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=367.28s)]
*  continue in this business. What can you do, Governor, to help? I said, we have this lawsuit. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=372.4s)]
*  This was 48 hours ago and I'm looking forward to emailing him back and reminding him of the impacts, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=376.32s)]
*  this momentary impact. This federal court decision today that may give him a reprieve. This is real [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=382.0s)]
*  and it's consequential and it's small businesses in particular that are being devastated by this [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  uncertainty. One of the things you've consistently pointed out as well is that Republican lawmakers [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=392.4s)]
*  do not like these tariffs at all, yet they pretend to be in favor of, they just, I guess, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=398.56s)]
*  just go mute. They go totally silent. The members of Congress, the House of Representatives and the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=406.32s)]
*  senators, if they want to pass legislation on this, they control both the House and Senate. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=412.64s)]
*  Can you speak to that, that you know that these Republicans are not just against it, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=419.36s)]
*  but very against it, yet they say nothing in the face of catastrophe? Yeah, appalling silence. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=424.08s)]
*  Shameful. Shameful. I mean, the decision, I hope people read both decisions. I mean, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=430.24s)]
*  it's about the complicity of Congress, the lack of oversight. You're in the majority. Do your damn [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=436.96s)]
*  job. Co-equal branch of government. I mean, that was the principles of the founding fathers. They [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=442.08s)]
*  lived and died for this fundamental notion of co-equal branches of government, government oversight, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=446.0s)]
*  and they've completely ceded it to Donald Trump illegally. Donald Trump's taken advantage of that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=450.48s)]
*  And of course, there are always exceptions. There are a few courageous elected officials. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=456.32s)]
*  Interestingly, people that at least speak out like Rand Paul, even Ted Cruz has spoken out against it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=461.76s)]
*  But I thought the ultimate expression of where the Republican Party actually is, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=467.36s)]
*  is always reflected in the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal that called it the dumbest [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=472.72s)]
*  trade war in history, Donald Trump. So they're all celebrating. The vast majority of these [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=477.36s)]
*  Republican legislative leaders are celebrating this decision quietly. But I think there's a chill [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=483.68s)]
*  because of the expectation again of what comes next, because Donald Trump hates to lose. And [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=489.92s)]
*  he's one thing, if not, he's predictably unpredictable in terms of how he responds to these losses. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=496.24s)]
*  And one of the things that's very concerning to our viewers as well as Donald Trump's attack on [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=501.44s)]
*  the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, and Trump will say things implying that [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=506.08s)]
*  he wants to fire Powell and then kind of walk it back. And I never said that. And then, you know, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=511.35999999999996s)]
*  it's just kind of, again, it's kind of the whole taco. It's like, what day is it going to be? But [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  again, this has real world implications. And Trump had Chairman Powell at the White House today. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=520.72s)]
*  He invited Powell. Powell had to come up with a statement immediately, not knowing what the heck [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=526.16s)]
*  Trump was going to post, basically saying at the president's invitation, Powell met with Trump [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=531.12s)]
*  today at the White House to discuss economic developments. Then he goes, Powell did not discuss [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=535.92s)]
*  his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=541.1999999999999s)]
*  on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook. Finally, Chairman Powell [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=546.9599999999999s)]
*  said that he and his colleagues will set monetary policy as required by law to support maximum [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=551.76s)]
*  employment and stable process and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=557.6s)]
*  and non-political analysis. I mean, the fact that he even has to say that coming out of the meeting [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=562.96s)]
*  is something, huh? Well, I mean, and he has to say it because the markets, remember, we were old [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=570.08s)]
*  enough to remember a few weeks ago where we were in the chaos in the international markets. And [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=575.44s)]
*  folks were speed dialing Trump, all these folks that were there at the inaugural, etc., saying, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=580.64s)]
*  what the hell are you doing? Stop talking about, Powell, stop talking about replacing him. You [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=585.2s)]
*  appointed him, Mr. President, in the first term. He's your guy, but he's an independent [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=590.72s)]
*  operator. And that is foundational in terms of the full faith and credit of the United States [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=597.0400000000001s)]
*  of America. You're putting that at risk. You've already put truth and trust at risk around the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=601.6800000000001s)]
*  globe as it relates to our allies and the impacts we've had on our trading partners. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=606.0s)]
*  But when it comes to the markets, he obviously felt that pressure. And look, at the end of the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=610.4s)]
*  day, you know, the markets last and they bat a thousand. And Donald Trump, if nothing else, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=615.6s)]
*  has been very sensitive to the markets, particularly the bond market. And so I'm not surprised by that [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=621.76s)]
*  statement by Powell. But this is an area where even Trump recognized his own recklessness. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=627.52s)]
*  Finally, Governor, just a lot of people across the country are worried right now. They're nervous. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=633.04s)]
*  They see this disastrous budget bill. Are we going to lose health care? Are we going to lose [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hew1hZpoBPE&t=638.72s)]
