# Trump PANICS at Night as WAR HAUNTS HIM
**MeidasTouch:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE)
*  Throughout the night, Donald Trump was having a meltdown, posting away on social media that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=0.0s)]
*  trust him. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=8.02s)]
*  The strikes on Iran were perfect. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=9.4s)]
*  You know how he does the perfect phone call? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=12.86s)]
*  These were the perfect strikes. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=15.72s)]
*  So perfect, he needs to post over and over again just to make sure you know that, because [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=17.46s)]
*  that's what presidents do. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=24.32s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump posted. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=26.580000000000002s)]
*  I'm being sarcastic. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=28.38s)]
*  He posts, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=29.38s)]
*  Monumental damage was done to all nuclear sites in Iran, as shown by satellite images. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=30.38s)]
*  Obliteration is an accurate term. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  The white structure shown is deeply embedded into the rock, with even its roof well below [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=41.14s)]
*  ground level and completely shielded from flame. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=47.94s)]
*  What the hell does that even mean? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=52.379999999999995s)]
*  The biggest damage took place far below ground level. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=54.12s)]
*  Bullseye! [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  Exclamation point, exclamation point. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=60.64s)]
*  Bullseye! is what he writes. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  You know, as New York Times is reporting, while Iran's Fordow nuclear site took damages, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=65.32s)]
*  it was not fully destroyed. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=73.56s)]
*  You have Donald Trump's vice president, J.D. Vance, signaling that Iran can still enrich [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  uranium, that it still controls enriched uranium stockpiles. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=83.88s)]
*  You have Netanyahu saying, the extent of damage is still to be seen, so Israel is starting [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=89.28s)]
*  to hedge. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=98.16s)]
*  And then you had Kayleigh McEnany, Donald Trump's former press secretary on Fox, saying, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  not only is Donald Trump thinking about regime change in Iran last night. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  She goes, all dictators, you should be worried that Donald Trump's going to do regime change [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=113.58s)]
*  against you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=119.62s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=121.0s)]
*  Precisely, every dictator in the world is on notice now. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=122.5s)]
*  Folks, Donald Trump is feeling so strong right now that he is begging. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=127.14s)]
*  You know Donald Trump's expression, begging like a dog. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=132.7s)]
*  He's begging China, Xi Jinping, to prevent Iran from closing the strait of her moves [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=136.18s)]
*  and disrupting global oil flows. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=143.9s)]
*  So I'm just trying to get this straight. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=147.5s)]
*  Donald Trump declares trade war against the world and China. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=149.18s)]
*  Donald Trump bombs Iran. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=154.74s)]
*  Donald Trump begs China to speak with Iran. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=156.94s)]
*  That doesn't sound like someone who's supremely confident. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=161.3s)]
*  Forget supremely confident, Donald Trump is just outright insane. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=165.34s)]
*  Here were the emails that he was sending yesterday. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=170.12s)]
*  Sending emails like this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=173.72s)]
*  During war with Iran, he's sending emails like this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=175.62s)]
*  Ben, before the 4th of July comes, I just want you to have my golf balls. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=179.18s)]
*  Trump's signature golf balls. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=184.74s)]
*  I want you to have these. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=186.34s)]
*  I've signed collectible golf balls just for you, but we'll only have a few of these left [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=188.22s)]
*  in stock. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=194.44000000000003s)]
*  So if you want them, you've got to order before midnight. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=195.44000000000003s)]
*  Because I remember, why does FDR and Truman and Eisenhower or JFK or Clinton or Obama, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=201.28s)]
*  I remember that after military action, they would say, you need my golf balls? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=211.36s)]
*  You want some golf balls, everybody? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=219.32000000000002s)]
*  Five dollars. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=221.28000000000003s)]
*  If you donate five dollars, you could be entered into golf ball competition. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=222.28s)]
*  Or here's another offer from Trump. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=226.76s)]
*  Ben, you want to go to the fair with Donald Trump? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=229.4s)]
*  No, I really don't want to do any of those things. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=232.84s)]
*  Let's see how Americans feel about Donald Trump's conduct. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=237.28s)]
*  The latest YouGov poll from yesterday, June 22nd. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=240.94s)]
*  Do you want America to be at war with Iran? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=244.88s)]
*  85% of Americans say no. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=248.48s)]
*  Only 5% of Americans say yes. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=251.52s)]
*  How about Trump's approval on Iran? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  Only 35% of Americans approve. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=257.92s)]
*  53% disapprove. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=261.12s)]
*  So I guess the plan then must be, pretend that we're actually not at war with Iran. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=263.74s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=271.52s)]
*  So maybe bring on Marco Rubio and have Marco Rubio say, we're not, no, no, no, no. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=272.52s)]
*  There's no war with Iran. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=279.56s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=282.28s)]
*  Are we now at war with Iran? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=284.2s)]
*  No, we're not. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=286.56s)]
*  This is not a war against Iran. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=288.88s)]
*  This is, this is very simple. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=290.32s)]
*  You know, 67 days ago, the president of the United States sent the Iranians a letter and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=292.12s)]
*  it said, you're not going to have nuclear weapons. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  You're not going to have a militarized nuclear program. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  Let's negotiate. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  I want to do this diplomatically. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  I want to do this peacefully. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  They played, they tried to play them along the way they've played every American president [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=304.88s)]
*  for the last 35 years. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  And you know, the president told them, if we don't get a deal, which is what he wanted, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=310.56s)]
*  then I'll have to handle it differently. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=314.44s)]
*  And that's- [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=315.88s)]
*  Or maybe you have JD Vance. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=316.88s)]
*  I mean JD. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=318.24s)]
*  JD says, well no, we're at war with the nuclear facilities. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=320.04s)]
*  This isn't a real war. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=324.0s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh, it isn't? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  Do you tell Iran that? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=330.68s)]
*  Question, Mr. Vice President, is the United States now at war with Iran? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=331.68s)]
*  No, Kristen, we're not at war with Iran. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=336.36s)]
*  We're at war with Iran's nuclear program. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=341.08000000000004s)]
*  And let me just say, Kristen, that we're incredibly grateful and proud of the American Air Force [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  pilots who did an incredible job last night. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=349.24s)]
*  So now one of the things that Trump's propagandists are doing is they are preemptively blaming [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=352.76s)]
*  terrorist attacks in the United States and against American assets abroad on, you guessed [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=361.72s)]
*  it, former President Biden. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=368.72s)]
*  Charlie Kirk, one of Donald Trump's top propagandists, posts, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=371.0s)]
*  Stay armed, stay vigilant. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  We have no idea how many sleeper cells are inside the United States. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=376.28000000000003s)]
*  It's an unforgivable weakness that Biden left the country with. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=381.0s)]
*  Stay alert, pray. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, let's blame former President Biden for what Donald Trump did. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=387.24s)]
*  Bill Mulligan on Fox, same thing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=391.36s)]
*  He goes, Here are the numbers of Iranians who came in through the border under Biden. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=393.12s)]
*  We don't know how many of them are terrorists, but stay vigilant. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=398.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, the State Department has issued a worldwide caution for all United States [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  citizens here and abroad to exercise extreme care because as a result of Donald Trump, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=410.36s)]
*  you are a target now. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  As our editor in chief, Ron Filippkowski, writes, apparently MAGA voted to occupy Gaza [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=420.68s)]
*  and develop it after displacing the population, run mineral companies in Ukraine, make Iran [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=426.2s)]
*  great again by installing a pro-Trump regime, selling scenic federal land to developers, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=434.68s)]
*  Trump crypto scams, record deficits and trade wars. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=442.52s)]
*  We've been covering this on a lot of our social media accounts and at MidasPlus.com, so check [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=447.76s)]
*  it out. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=452.88s)]
*  But one of the things in Donald Trump's disastrous budget bill, in addition to taking away health [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=453.88s)]
*  care from 15 million Americans, taking away food stamps, taking away housing benefits, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  giving billionaires trillions of dollars in tax cuts, it also sells off 250 million acres [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=468.88s)]
*  of federal land to Donald Trump's billionaire friends. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  Wow, wow, wow. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=479.88s)]
*  Okay, you have Iran's foreign minister meeting with Putin in Moscow today because there's [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=480.88s)]
*  an alliance there that Donald Trump didn't realize. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=489.08000000000004s)]
*  As I mentioned, you had Donald Trump begging China, you have that internationally. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=492.44s)]
*  And you had Donald Trump making posts like this yesterday as well. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=497.6s)]
*  It's not politically correct to use the term regime change, but if the current Iranian [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=502.28000000000003s)]
*  regime is unable to make Iran great again, why wouldn't there be regime change? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=506.56s)]
*  Make Iran great again. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcWHiVxOLGE&t=512.08s)]
