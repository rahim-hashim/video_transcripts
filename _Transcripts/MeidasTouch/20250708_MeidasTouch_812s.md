# SICKLY Trump has MELTDOWN as he Gets OUTMATCHED
**MeidasTouch:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY)
*  More explosions in Ukraine as Russia launches ballistic missiles and Shaheed drones, killing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=0.0s)]
*  innocent civilians there in Ukraine. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=12.36s)]
*  What I showed you there at the outset was in the Kharkiv region, 71 victims including [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=15.0s)]
*  seven children, and Russia has only escalated since Putin and Donald Trump spoke last week. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Putin announced to the world that he and Donald Trump were going to make movies and musicals [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=27.2s)]
*  together to bridge the cultural traditions of the United States and Russia. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=32.16s)]
*  And then Putin escalated with more strikes in Kiev and throughout Ukraine, killing many, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=38.12s)]
*  many more people. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=43.72s)]
*  And Donald Trump just continues to say, oh, I'm so disappointed. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  I'm so disappointed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=48.08s)]
*  Donald Trump held a bizarre dinner last night with Benjamin Netanyahu in the White House. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=49.64s)]
*  Netanyahu said, Donald, I'm going to give you a recommendation for a Nobel Peace Prize [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=56.08s)]
*  for everything that you've done. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=62.76s)]
*  I'm sure the Nobel Peace Prize board is very happy that Netanyahu is giving Trump the Nobel [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=64.0s)]
*  Peace Prize nomination. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=70.6s)]
*  I'm sure they're going to say great work there, Netanyahu. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=71.84s)]
*  I'm being sarcastic, of course. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=74.84s)]
*  As we said on the Midas Touch Network as well, the real border crisis, just look at Donald [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump's face here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=81.8s)]
*  Look how kind of sickly and unwell and just his physical appearance lately has been so [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=82.92s)]
*  odd as Adam Kinzinger says, honest to God, what's up with the face makeup? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=87.84s)]
*  Is he not even trying to disguise it anymore? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=93.04s)]
*  One of the things that Donald Trump is still trying to disguise is that he's making all [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=97.0s)]
*  of these deals. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=102.6s)]
*  I'm making these deals. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=103.6s)]
*  I made trade deals. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=104.6s)]
*  Remember, Donald Trump promised he was going to do 90 deals in 90 days. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=105.8s)]
*  He's basically done zero deals in 90 days, but now he's claiming he's done all of the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=110.12s)]
*  deals he's promised because he's sending a letter to all of these foreign countries telling [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=115.4s)]
*  them what their tariffs are going to be. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  The letter that Donald Trump sent looks like it was written by a second grader learning [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=124.56s)]
*  to write letters for the first time. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=130.72s)]
*  No offense to second graders. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=132.8s)]
*  It had typos. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=134.56s)]
*  It referred to female presidents as Mr. And then they had to correct it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=135.56s)]
*  And you just take a look right here, for example, at the letter they sent to Japan. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=141.48s)]
*  Let me just read you a portion so you can see how odd these letters are. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  Dear Mr. Prime Minister, to Prime Minister Ashiba, it is a great honor for me to send [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=151.0s)]
*  you this letter in that it demonstrates the strength and commitment of our trading relationship [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=156.4s)]
*  and the fact that the United States of America has agreed to continue working with Japan [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=161.44s)]
*  despite having a significant trade deficit with your country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=165.4s)]
*  Nevertheless, we have decided to move forward with you, but only with more balanced and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=169.0s)]
*  fair trade and trades all in caps. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=173.44s)]
*  Therefore, we invite you to participate in this extraordinary economy of the United States, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=175.68s)]
*  the number one market in the world by far. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=180.72s)]
*  We've had years to discuss our trading relationships with Japan, and we've concluded we must move [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=183.4s)]
*  away from these long term and very persistent trade deficits engendered by Japan's tariff [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=187.8s)]
*  and non tariff policies. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=193.32s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=194.56s)]
*  Japan does not put tariffs on automobiles from the United States, which Donald Trump [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=195.56s)]
*  claims. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=200.04s)]
*  Also, Trump did a trade deal with Japan in 2019 that Donald Trump is now breaching. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=201.04s)]
*  Donald Trump sent one of these letters to South Korea. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=206.64s)]
*  There is a free trade deal with South Korea. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=209.68s)]
*  Donald Trump just making like random tariffs for countries as well. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=212.92s)]
*  And just think if you're Prime Minister Ashiba and you get that letter, what's your reaction [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=217.6s)]
*  is going to be? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=222.12s)]
*  Prime Minister Ashiba says we're not going to give in to the United States that easily. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=223.32s)]
*  And Japan is the number one foreign investor in the United States. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=229.32s)]
*  Like by far, they're the number one holder of United States treasuries by far. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=234.64s)]
*  They're the number one employer from a foreign country of United States employees by far. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=239.74s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=247.06s)]
*  What are you even talking about? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=249.22s)]
*  And so here was Donald Trump at this bizarre dinner with Benjamin Netanyahu last night [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=251.22s)]
*  when Trump says we did the deals. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=255.82000000000002s)]
*  We've done 90 deals in nine days. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=257.58s)]
*  We're done here. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=259.26s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=260.26s)]
*  Mr. President, on tariffs, what happened to 90 trade deals in 90 days? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=261.26s)]
*  Oh, we've spoken to everybody. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=266.78s)]
*  We know everything. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=268.78s)]
*  It's all done. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=269.78s)]
*  I told you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=270.78s)]
*  I told you we'll make some deals. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=271.78s)]
*  But for the most part, we're going to send a letter. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=274.46s)]
*  We're going to say welcome to the United States if you'd like to participate in the greatest, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=276.18s)]
*  most successful country ever. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=281.26s)]
*  I mean, we're doing better than ever. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=283.58s)]
*  We have I don't think I knew this. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=286.38s)]
*  You these numbers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  We've never had numbers like this. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=289.5s)]
*  We've never had investment like this. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=290.9s)]
*  We have more than 90. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=293.26s)]
*  We're going to have much more than 90. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=294.26s)]
*  But most of those are going to be sent to letter. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=295.74s)]
*  This is exactly what I said. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=297.82s)]
*  And then you have Peter Navarro, one of Donald Trump's top advisors, attacking the chairman [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, for the economy not doing well in the United States [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=304.46s)]
*  right now. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=311.21999999999997s)]
*  Our stock market is a Ponzi scheme market right now. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  And the Trump regime is totally manipulating that with their oligarch friends. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=314.9s)]
*  But you want to look at some systemic issues. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=319.58s)]
*  Look at core inflation. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=322.14s)]
*  Look at the dollar that's off to its worst start since 1973. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=323.7s)]
*  Look at tourism down tens of billions of dollars as other people in other countries don't want [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=329.1s)]
*  to come to the United States anymore. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=335.46s)]
*  Look at new construction at all time lows. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=338.1s)]
*  Look at all of some of the systemic data. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=340.86s)]
*  And you'll see right now that our economy is absolutely struggling. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=343.3s)]
*  But here's Navarro trying to make Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who Donald [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=346.65999999999997s)]
*  Trump appointed into the next Fauci. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=352.34s)]
*  They're going to blame it all on Navarro. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=355.09999999999997s)]
*  Navarro is going to blame it all on Powell the way they blamed it on Fauci. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=357.58s)]
*  You're playing this clip. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=360.97999999999996s)]
*  Powell is doing the same thing he did with the first term of Donald Trump. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=361.97999999999996s)]
*  He doesn't understand Trumpnomics. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=366.17999999999995s)]
*  He doesn't understand the supply side aspects of tax cuts and deregulation. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=369.29999999999995s)]
*  He doesn't understand the importance of strategic energy dominance and the president's ability [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=374.65999999999997s)]
*  to dramatically lower oil prices. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=380.26000000000005s)]
*  And he doesn't have a clue about terrorists. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=382.46000000000004s)]
*  Now, one of the other things that should be noted as well is that there's been a BRICS [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=385.22s)]
*  meeting, right? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=389.58000000000004s)]
*  That's the kind of loose alliance or informal alliance between Brazil, Russia, India, China [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=390.74s)]
*  and South Africa trading group, the BRICS group, which is expanding in Rio de Janeiro. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=396.86s)]
*  They've been holding a meeting. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=401.98s)]
*  And guess who was there on the sidelines of that meeting? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=403.34000000000003s)]
*  Remember how Donald Trump left the G7 like immediately when he was supposed to meet with [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=406.7s)]
*  President Claudius Scheinbaum of Mexico and India's leader and he was supposed to meet [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=413.14s)]
*  with the prime minister of Australia. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=420.02s)]
*  Remember Trump blew off all of the... [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=422.34s)]
*  And Ashiba, remember Trump blew off all of those meetings? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=423.98s)]
*  Well, Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, was there meeting with Mexico's minister, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=426.98s)]
*  was there meeting with all of these foreign ministers, India's foreign minister. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=433.34000000000003s)]
*  They were all there to improve their bilateral relations. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=438.1s)]
*  So as Donald Trump weakens the United States, attacks our allies, you see Russia, China, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=442.14s)]
*  all these other countries making their moves and weakening the United States. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=450.66s)]
*  And what's Donald Trump doing while attacking our allies? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=454.62s)]
*  Donald Trump's also attacking California specifically, but he's doing this in lots of other states, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=457.46000000000004s)]
*  targeting blue states, mostly in blue cities, but he's attacking the entire country. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=463.98s)]
*  California has the fourth largest GDP in the world if California was a country, over $4 trillion. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=469.1s)]
*  And Donald Trump is attacking California. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=480.02000000000004s)]
*  Here we go again, MacArthur Park in Los Angeles. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=483.58s)]
*  There was a summer camp yesterday. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=487.94s)]
*  People were camped, kids were there and what was going down? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=490.38s)]
*  Trump sent like militarized ICE and federal agents in a military formation. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=494.38s)]
*  The kids had to like run off of the park and you can see here, play the B-roll so people can see [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=501.5s)]
*  what was going down right there. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=506.54s)]
*  How utterly, utterly sick, sinister and sadistic that it was. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=508.78s)]
*  Here's a Los Angeles mayor, Bass, talking about what went down. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=512.3s)]
*  Here's what she says in her own words. Play this clip. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=517.8199999999999s)]
*  So this morning it was frightening in Los Angeles to see tanks essentially rolling onto MacArthur Park. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=519.98s)]
*  I watched a video a little later to see the troops along with mounted patrols [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=528.66s)]
*  marching through in formation at MacArthur Park where the children that were there for their summer [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=535.26s)]
*  day camp had to leave and go into a building. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=541.3399999999999s)]
*  So they had to hide the children because they didn't want the children to see that the park was [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=545.18s)]
*  being taken over by ICE. It was an egregious show of force. I have no idea what their purpose was. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=549.9s)]
*  I don't even think they detained anybody. At this point in time, I think they just want to sow [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=555.5s)]
*  terror and fear around our city and every now and then the military, the Custom and Border Patrol, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=561.1800000000001s)]
*  or some other federal office shows up. Los Angeles was peaceful before June 5th. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=567.66s)]
*  We need to go back to that. Thank you. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=574.38s)]
*  Now also yesterday, Donald Trump was praising Cash Patel, his FBI director and deputy FBI director [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=576.62s)]
*  Dan Bongino. He says they're doing great work after they deep-six the Epstein files. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=584.0600000000001s)]
*  Now the DOJ and FBI, I've done lots of videos on this just so you can go back and look at it, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=590.62s)]
*  are saying that the Epstein files actually don't exist and never existed and Epstein [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=595.58s)]
*  never tried to blackmail Richmond. We literally have Pam Bondi on tape saying the Epstein [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=601.66s)]
*  list and the Epstein files are on her desk. We have countless statements from Cash Patel and [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=607.18s)]
*  JD Vance and others in the Trump regime saying that they were going to release these files. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=614.46s)]
*  Trump said he was going to release these files, but anyway, here we go again. More [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=619.02s)]
*  lies from the Trump regime. Obviously, Trump and Epstein were close. Trump's all over the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=622.9399999999999s)]
*  Epstein files that have been released already in deposition transcripts, on flight logs, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=628.22s)]
*  on call logs. Trump's DOE 174 in other cases relating to Epstein. Trump says Epstein's a [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=633.9s)]
*  great guy. Epstein traffic girls that he found at Mar-a-Lago like Virginia Joufray, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=643.18s)]
*  who was homeless and then she was 17 and got a job at Mar-a-Lago. We have all these videos of [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=650.62s)]
*  Trump partying with Epstein, so we know what was up. Then here, going back to that bizarre [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=655.18s)]
*  dinner that Donald Trump had with Netanyahu, here's Donald Trump lying and saying that [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=660.6999999999999s)]
*  Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and UAE and others have helped bring in $15 trillion to the United [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=666.9399999999999s)]
*  States already and they say America's so hot and everyone says America's hot. Then Trump's like, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=673.02s)]
*  we're hot. Israel was hot, but not like we're hot. Here, play this clip. But we're up to over $15 [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=678.86s)]
*  trillion coming into our country. There's never been anything like it anywhere in the world. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=684.86s)]
*  There's never been an investment like that anywhere in the world. Look, I told this story and [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=689.98s)]
*  I just told it to Bibi backstage. I was talking to him and I said, you know, the king of Saudi [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=697.26s)]
*  Arabia, smart guy. And also we went to Qatar and we went to UAE. Really three strong leaders, smart [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=701.9s)]
*  guys. They all told me the same thing. And then that was reiterated at NATO just recently when [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=710.14s)]
*  we got back where they agreed to spend a trillion dollars a year, by the way, which is about three [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=715.42s)]
*  times what they were spending. But they all said the same thing. We thought your country was dead. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=719.9s)]
*  Horrible term, right? We thought the United States of America was dead and now you're [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=726.46s)]
*  presiding over the hottest country anywhere in the world. We're the hottest country in the world. I [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=731.9s)]
*  think Bibi would admit it even hotter than Israel, though Israel was pretty hot about a week ago. I [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=736.7s)]
*  can tell you for the wrong reasons. Like, do we all realize how humiliating this is? We're hot. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=741.26s)]
*  Our country's hot. What the? Why can't we just look at this and go, what the hell is this [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=747.74s)]
*  maniac talking about? We're hot. Also, you should know that the entire GDP of Qatar is like 150 [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=752.7s)]
*  billion. The UAE less than 400 billion. Saudi Arabia's entire GDP, what's like two trillion, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=760.5400000000001s)]
*  maybe less than two trillion. So their entire GDP of these countries is less than 15 trillion. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=771.1s)]
*  We're not bringing in 15 trillion. They're just literally making everything up right here over and [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=777.5s)]
*  over again. Horrific stuff. Anyway, we'll keep you posted every step of the way, but [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WInihp3qAY&t=784.7s)]
