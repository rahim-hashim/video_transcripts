# PANICKED White House has MELTDOWN at Press Briefing
**MeidasTouch:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs)
*  Wow, a disastrous White House press conference just unfolded. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's chief propagandist, Caroline Levitt, was asked why Donald Trump lied about a white [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=4.4s)]
*  genocide burial site to the South African president, President Ramaphosa, who visited [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=10.68s)]
*  the White House and was in the Oval Office yesterday. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=17.54s)]
*  Trump was claiming there was a burial site where thousands of white Africans who were [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=20.42s)]
*  killed in a genocide were buried. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  There's no genocide targeting white South Africans taking place, but here play this clip. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=27.92s)]
*  The video showed images of crosses in South Africa about white farmers who have been killed [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=57.92s)]
*  and politically persecuted because of the color of their skin. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=70.08s)]
*  Those crosses are representing their lives and the fact that they are now dead and their [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=77.04s)]
*  government did nothing about it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=81.08s)]
*  Are you disputing that there's no... [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=83.26s)]
*  The video showed what the president claimed it showed because it did not show that, but [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=85.16s)]
*  even more, what I'm asking you is who at the White House... [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  No, it did show that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=90.8s)]
*  It showed white crosses representing people who have perished because of racial persecution. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=91.8s)]
*  The White House verifies the videos that the president shows and what protocols are in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=95.36s)]
*  place when there's unsubstantiated information being put out for the world and world leaders. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  Yamiche, what's unsubstantiated about the video? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=103.88s)]
*  The video shows crosses that represent the dead bodies of people who were racially persecuted [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=106.16s)]
*  by their government. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=111.44s)]
*  In fact, the Associated Press of all places has a picture of that very monument and the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=112.44s)]
*  caption from the Associated Press is, each cross marks a white farmer who has been killed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=117.88s)]
*  in a farm murder. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  So it is substantiated, not just by that video and the physical evidence that everybody saw [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  on display in the Oval Office, but also by another outlet in the stream, the Associated [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=129.4s)]
*  Press. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=132.76s)]
*  So you should take it up with them if you believe the claim is unsubstantiated and that's [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=133.76s)]
*  a ridiculous line of questioning. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=136.68s)]
*  John, go ahead. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=138.24s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=139.24s)]
*  The White House's Caroline Levitt claims that Donald Trump's meeting with the largest holders [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=140.24s)]
*  of Trump crypto meme coins, where the average individual has basically given Trump a million [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=145.56s)]
*  dollars in terms of crypto contributions, that that's on Donald Trump's personal time [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=152.8s)]
*  so that the White House is not going to release any list about who Trump is meeting with, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=158.12s)]
*  who's buying influence, because that's his personal time. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=166.68s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=167.96s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=168.96s)]
*  Caroline, you guys are very proud of your record on transparency. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=170.68s)]
*  I have two transparency related questions for you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  On the president's dinner tonight, will the White House commit to making a list of the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=176.16s)]
*  attendees public so people can see who's paying for that kind of access to the president? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=180.0s)]
*  Well, as you know, Gareth, this question has been raised with the president. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=184.8s)]
*  I have also addressed the dinner tonight. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  The president is attending it in his personal time. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=190.24s)]
*  It is not a White House dinner. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=193.84s)]
*  It's not taking place here at the White House. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=195.28s)]
*  But certainly I can raise that question and try to get you an answer for it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=197.44s)]
*  OK, and on the Qatari aircraft, the Air Force has said they're going to classify all the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=200.64s)]
*  information about the work that has to get done to bring it up to snuff to be Air Force [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=205.48s)]
*  One. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=208.6s)]
*  Previous Air Force One contracts, including the one that the president entered into in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=209.6s)]
*  2018, are public. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=213.64s)]
*  That's available knowledge. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=215.56s)]
*  Will the White House commit to releasing who's doing that work and the cost of that work? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=216.56s)]
*  I understand that some elements might be classified about specific systems, but will you commit [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=220.72s)]
*  to releasing that basic information so people can see ultimately what this costs? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=224.64s)]
*  Well, Gareth, as you know, that's a question for the Department of Defense in the United [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  States Air Force who is accepting this jet as part of their fleet. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  Declassify it in one. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=235.04s)]
*  Well, you'll have to ask the Department of Defense in the United States Air Force who [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=236.04s)]
*  is accepting this jet as part of its fleet. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=239.67999999999998s)]
*  Peter. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  The president. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=243.23999999999998s)]
*  Caroline Levitt then gaslights lies to the American people even more. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  And she says hatred has no place in the United States under Donald Trump. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=248.2s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=252.27999999999997s)]
*  Hatred has no place in the United States of America under President Donald Trump. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=253.92s)]
*  Literally Donald Trump makes posts and says he hates different people every single day. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=259.24s)]
*  I mean, you can go back earlier this week where Donald Trump said that he wants the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=263.36s)]
*  DOJ to criminally investigate Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, Bono, New York Attorney General [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  Letitia James, Kamala Harris. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=275.76s)]
*  The list goes Oprah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=278.96s)]
*  I hate Taylor Swift in the past. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=281.32s)]
*  I mean, the guy is the most hateful guy, but go on, Caroline Levitt. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=284.12s)]
*  The next thing Caroline Levitt says in the same breath is that she thinks that there [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=288.08s)]
*  should be some sort of retribution to the MAGA Republican Congress member Massey and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=292.24s)]
*  Davidson who voted against the budget. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=298.44s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=300.64s)]
*  The view of the White House. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=301.64s)]
*  You had two Republicans last night that voted against this bill, Congressman Massey and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=302.64s)]
*  Davidson. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=306.76s)]
*  Does the president think that they should be primaries? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=307.76s)]
*  I believe he does. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=310.16s)]
*  And I don't think he likes to see grandstanders in Congress. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=311.04s)]
*  What's the alternative? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=313.64s)]
*  I would ask those members of Congress, did they want to see a tax hike? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=314.68s)]
*  Did they want to see our country go bankrupt? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=317.88s)]
*  That's the alternative by them trying to vote no. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=320.16s)]
*  And the president believes the Republican Party needs to be unified. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=322.96s)]
*  And the vast majority of Republicans clearly are and are listening to the president. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=325.8s)]
*  They are trusting in President Trump as they should, because there's a reason he's sitting [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=330.52s)]
*  in this oval office. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=334.68s)]
*  It's because he's the unequivocal leader of the Republican Party, not just a president [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=335.64s)]
*  for Republicans, but all Americans. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=340.08s)]
*  The president's approval rating is at an all time high right now. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=341.76s)]
*  That's because he knows how to deliver. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=344.44s)]
*  And Republicans like Thomas Massey and others should take note. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  Steve, a reporter asked Caroline Levitt, how is it not enriching Donald Trump when he [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=350.88s)]
*  is using the presidency to get gifts and using it to sell meme coins and using it to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=356.84s)]
*  sell products and using it to sell access here? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=363.12s)]
*  Here's what she says. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=367.0s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=367.96s)]
*  And just following up on the dinner tonight, you mentioned this is not a White House dinner, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=369.0s)]
*  but the president is always the president and the Trump family is making money off of [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=372.12s)]
*  this. So can you just explain how is this not the president using the office to enrich [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=376.2s)]
*  himself? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=380.52s)]
*  All of the president's assets are in a blind trust, which is managed by his children. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=381.08s)]
*  And I would argue one of the many reasons that the American people reelected this president [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  back to this office is because he was a very successful businessman before giving it up [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=390.36s)]
*  to publicly serve our country. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=395.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  They're still going with the blind trust. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=397.76s)]
*  I mean, again, these people lie about literally everything. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=399.56s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump is out there promoting businesses and telling people to buy his meme [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=404.96s)]
*  coin through the roof, through the to the moon or whatever the hell that they say. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  Next, Caroline Levitt has a Freudian slip where she admits that the Trump regime is [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=415.32s)]
*  going after pro-Palestinian protesters and pro-Palestinian voices. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=422.08s)]
*  But then she says, I mean, pro-Hamas, I mean, pro-Hamas. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=428.12s)]
*  This tells you all you need to know that the regime is going after people who support [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=432.68s)]
*  Palestine. That's just what they're doing here. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=436.24s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=438.4s)]
*  Well, the Secretary of State Marco Rubio has revoked thousands of student visas from [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=439.24s)]
*  campuses where these pro-Palestinian, pro-Hamas terrorist campus agitators and violent [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=444.88s)]
*  protests took place. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=451.88s)]
*  And we've also withheld funding from those very campuses as well in an effort to combat [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=453.44s)]
*  anti-Semitism. So the president's made it very clear that such hatred will have no place [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=458.08s)]
*  in our country. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=462.44s)]
*  Next up, Caroline Levitt lies and claims that the budget bill, which probably is going to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=464.84s)]
*  start adding $4 trillion annually to the deficit. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=470.24s)]
*  She says, actually, this is going to save $1.6 trillion. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=474.40000000000003s)]
*  There's there's nobody other than Donald Trump lying that claims this is going to save [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=478.88s)]
*  $1.6 trillion. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=483.68s)]
*  This is the most fiscally irresponsible budget that's ever been passed in the history of [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=485.64s)]
*  the United States. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=489.68s)]
*  During Trump's first term, he added $8 to $9 trillion to the deficit. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=490.88s)]
*  I predict right now that number is going to be more like 30 or 40 when all is said and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=496.04s)]
*  done. By the way, that's what Magna Republican Thomas Massey says as well here. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=500.36s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=504.12s)]
*  Switching gears, Caroline. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=505.08s)]
*  Just following up on Warren Davidson, I want to read you his quote that he posted online. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=507.08s)]
*  While I love many things in the bill promising someone else will cut spending in the future [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=510.8s)]
*  does not cut spending, deficits do matter and this bill grows them. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=514.16s)]
*  Why should that get a Republican primary? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=517.64s)]
*  This bill saves $1.6 trillion for the American taxpayer. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=519.84s)]
*  It saves more than any bill that has ever passed Capitol Hill has. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=525.04s)]
*  In fact, by double, the next bill saved $800 billion. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=528.1999999999999s)]
*  This bill saves $1.6 trillion. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=531.28s)]
*  So this is a very good bill for the American people, the American taxpayer. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=533.8000000000001s)]
*  And I believe, as an outlet put it with a headline this morning, it might have been [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=538.0400000000001s)]
*  Politico, actually. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  They wrote that the American people are going to be flush with cash when this thing is [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=543.4000000000001s)]
*  signed into law. And that's a good thing for American taxpayers. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=547.12s)]
*  One thing I want you to also know about the budget is that it still has to be passed [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=550.72s)]
*  by the Senate. It doesn't mean that it's already passed just because the House did what [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=556.4000000000001s)]
*  they did. I want to remind you, the Senate then goes through it and the Senate's going to [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=560.52s)]
*  remove a lot of the things that the House did. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  Then the question is, what's the House going to do when the Senate removes a lot of these [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=566.8s)]
*  things? You know, as I watch these press conferences, I reflect a lot on the types of [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  coverage in general that's being done right now in the Trump regime and seeing where [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=575.48s)]
*  people are getting their news and how they're consuming their news and what audiences [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=579.96s)]
*  Caroline Levitt's trying to hit right here. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=584.24s)]
*  Let me just give you three important stories today as well. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=586.8s)]
*  Like, number one, the White House confirmed today as well that Trump is going to visit [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=589.0s)]
*  Canada for the G7 Leaders Summit. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=594.36s)]
*  There's no right wing media outlets that have covered that portion. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=597.24s)]
*  There's literally zero right wing media outlets are covering that. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=600.88s)]
*  Similarly, White House is now purging transcripts of Trump's remarks from its website, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=604.36s)]
*  in my opinion, because it looks like he has dementia when he speaks and he can't put [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=611.92s)]
*  sentences together. So they're completely getting rid of and deleting transcripts, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=615.92s)]
*  which I believe is a violation of the Presidential Records Act. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=620.12s)]
*  Zero percent. The right wing's not covering at all. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=623.5999999999999s)]
*  Also, following the meeting with Donald Trump, the South African president kind of [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=626.7199999999999s)]
*  brushed Trump aside and was like, whatever, like, I don't really give a crap about what he [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=631.36s)]
*  was saying. Like, I'm not scared of him. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=635.52s)]
*  He doesn't worry me at all. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=638.4799999999999s)]
*  It was what it was. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=640.0s)]
*  And again, zero percent of right wing media covered South African President Ramaphosa [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=641.6s)]
*  talking about that. It's just interesting to me when I'm showing you what Caroline [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=646.8000000000001s)]
*  Levitt's saying, because I'm thinking, what are people's media diets like? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=650.12s)]
*  So I use a research tool called ground news and ground news lets you burst out of your [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=654.0s)]
*  political bubble. It helps avoid selective reporting and it helps you better understand [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=660.04s)]
*  others. I think ground news is essential nowadays to see through any double standards in [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=665.44s)]
*  the current media ecosphere. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=670.44s)]
*  Here's what you got to do. Go to ground dot news slash MTN or scan the QR code. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=672.16s)]

*  Get out of your political bubble and check it out. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=695.76s)]
*  That's how I found those stories. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, OK, so the right wing's not covering this at all. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=700.12s)]
*  What does that tell me? And then how do I adjust my coverage to try to make sure more [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=703.04s)]
*  audiences are getting the truth right here? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=708.76s)]
*  I wanted to share this with you as well. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=712.56s)]
*  Caroline Levitt is asked how Donald Trump, what's going to happen with this military [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=714.48s)]
*  parade that Donald Trump is going to be wasting taxpayer dollars on? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=719.5999999999999s)]
*  She's like, he's celebrating the 250th anniversary of the Army. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=723.52s)]
*  That's why he's doing it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=727.72s)]
*  No, he's doing this for himself so he can look like Kim Jong-un. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=728.88s)]
*  Here, play this clip right here. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=732.6s)]
*  The president will further honor our military next month on June 14th when he hosts the [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=734.2s)]
*  250th anniversary of the United States Army with a grand military parade celebration [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=739.0400000000001s)]
*  right here in our nation's capital. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=745.76s)]
*  President Trump will be joined by veterans, active duty troops, wounded warriors, gold [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=748.36s)]
*  star families and patriotic Americans from across the country to celebrate our heroes [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=753.1999999999999s)]
*  who have kept us safe. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=758.3199999999999s)]
*  Tickets for the parade and the celebration are available through the America 250 [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=760.28s)]
*  Commission's event registration portal. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=764.12s)]
*  It will be a truly historic and special day for our country. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=766.64s)]
*  After the parade, President Trump will travel to the G7 Leaders Summit in Canada from [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=770.8s)]
*  June 15th through the 17th. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=775.3199999999999s)]
*  I know, right. So utterly, utterly pathetic. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=777.4399999999999s)]
*  One thing I want to share with you as well is that we're learning that the Trump [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=780.32s)]
*  administration just issued an order halting Harvard's ability to enroll international [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=785.12s)]
*  students. That's going to be challenged. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=790.36s)]
*  It's going to be declared a violation of the law. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=792.44s)]
*  But Trump is saying if you are an international student, you can't go to Harvard. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=794.84s)]
*  You will be deported immediately, which in the Trump regime means concentration camps [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=799.44s)]
*  in El Salvador or Sudan or Libya or some of the other places they're sending them to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=803.64s)]
*  because they want to destroy our best academic research institutes. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=809.48s)]
*  You know, there's brain drain away from the United States now towards other countries. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=813.24s)]
*  China's recruiting, Europe's recruiting in America, which used to get the brain drain [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=818.72s)]
*  from other countries is going to be brain drained. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=823.64s)]
*  And this is part of the systematic tearing down and destruction of the United States [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=826.88s)]
*  from the enemy from within. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=831.12s)]
*  Donald Trump is the enemy from within. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=832.76s)]
*  That's where that term comes from. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=834.56s)]
*  Trump is the enemy from within. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=835.96s)]
*  Trump is the enemy from within. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=837.48s)]
*  Trump is the enemy from within. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=839.12s)]
*  And then I'll just share this with you as well. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=841.4000000000001s)]
*  Speaking about Trump being the enemy from within, the Trump regime is demanding or [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=843.4000000000001s)]
*  begging the Supreme Court to block all of their block, all of the Doge activities. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=849.96s)]
*  They want to keep everything that Doge did secret so that there have so that there could [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=857.4000000000001s)]
*  be no Freedom of Information Act requests for from given to Doge. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=861.52s)]
*  They don't want Elon Musk to have to answer anything because they know that what they [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=866.8s)]
*  tried to do as the enemy of the people, the enemy from within, is to destroy essential [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=870.96s)]
*  services. So they don't want any of those emails being made public. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=876.92s)]
*  Let me just read from you from the Supreme Court's decision about due process. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=879.96s)]
*  So every time Caroline Levitt kind of rants and raves and says that, you know, the Supreme [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=883.88s)]
*  Court's doing this or the Supreme Court's doing that, which I want to show you in a [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=889.4s)]
*  second, here's what the Supreme Court said. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=892.84s)]
*  The Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of the law in the context of removal [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=894.92s)]
*  proceedings. Procedural due process rules are meant to protect against the mistaken [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=900.28s)]
*  or unjustified deprivation of life, liberty or property. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=905.24s)]
*  We have long held that no person shall be removed from the United States without opportunity [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=908.4399999999999s)]
*  at some time to be heard. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=912.92s)]
*  Due process requires notice that is reasonably calculated under the circumstances. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=914.28s)]
*  And of course, she says the opposite at the hearing. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=919.9599999999999s)]
*  Here's what Caroline Levitt says about that as well. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=922.72s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=924.9200000000001s)]
*  And now Judge Murphy is forcing federal officials to remain in Djibouti for over two weeks, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=925.84s)]
*  threatening our U.S. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=931.76s)]
*  diplomatic relationships with countries around the world and putting these agents' lives [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=933.08s)]
*  in danger by having to be with these illegal murderers, criminals and rapists. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=938.36s)]
*  This is completely absurd. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=943.48s)]
*  Judge Brian Murphy is not the secretary of state. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=946.08s)]
*  He is not the secretary of defense or the commander in chief. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=948.6s)]
*  He is a district court judge in Massachusetts. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkxv-ITtQs&t=951.76s)]
