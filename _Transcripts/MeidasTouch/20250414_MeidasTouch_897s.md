# FURIOUS Canada LEADS WORLD to DESTROY Trump
**MeidasTouch:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs)
*  If Donald Trump did anything, he woke us up. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=0.0s)]
*  Sucks to be you, Donald. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=3.6s)]
*  Once Canada wakes up, sucks to be you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=6.96s)]
*  That is Canadian legend Charlie Angus, who served as a member of parliament. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=12.72s)]
*  He was speaking there in Cumberland, British Columbia, gave an incredible speech there [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=18.72s)]
*  as part of his resistance tour. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=23.16s)]
*  More on that in a bit. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=25.66s)]
*  I want to talk though about generally how Canada is striking back. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=26.66s)]
*  They are tip of the spear in the fight against the authoritarian Trump regime, and they've [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=31.26s)]
*  really inspired the entire world in the international resistance against the Trump regime. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=37.1s)]
*  So elbows up, shout out to the maple mitis out there, and also thanks for the shout outs [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=43.66s)]
*  we've been getting in that resistance tour. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=49.58s)]
*  We greatly appreciate it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=51.46s)]
*  Let's talk about how Canada has been leading the world in the international resistance [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=53.42s)]
*  against the Trump regime and cornering Donald like the little cornered rat that he is. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=58.92s)]
*  No offense to cornered rats who behave far better than the way Trump is behaving. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=64.72s)]
*  A few things we should chat about, and then I want to talk a little bit more about Angus's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=70.6s)]
*  speech. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=74.8s)]
*  I mean, the first is Canada really showed the way with the boycott of all things American. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=75.8s)]
*  The boycott of American products, the boycott of American tourism, and there are the towns [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=81.14s)]
*  that rely on Canadian tourism. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=87.44s)]
*  They're really getting hit, but overall the American tourism industry is getting crushed. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=89.94s)]
*  Vegas is getting crushed. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=94.74s)]
*  I've seen various reports that tourism from Canada to the United States is down anywhere [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=96.06s)]
*  from 40 to about 85% depending on the area and which study you review. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=101.26s)]
*  I think it's towards the higher end of that, more like 85% is my view, but definitely more [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=108.1s)]
*  than 50%. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=113.44s)]
*  But what we're seeing right now is the number of Europeans traveling to the US also cratering. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=114.44s)]
*  They are following the lead of Canada. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=121.06s)]
*  Something I want to point out as well is that earlier in March, Canada began selling some [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=124.28s)]
*  of the United States Treasury bonds that they were holding. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=131.18s)]
*  Prime Minister Carney is a banker, probably the top economist in the world. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=137.54s)]
*  He previously led the Bank of Canada, got Canada through the Great Recession with the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=143.56s)]
*  soft landing in the mid-2000s, and then also helped as he led the Bank of England as the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=149.38s)]
*  governor of the Bank of England after Brexit and really helped the United Kingdom then. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=156.06s)]
*  And so Carney understands the way the Treasury markets work. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=162.29999999999998s)]
*  He understands how dependent the United States is on its bonds being viewed as a safe haven [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=165.85999999999999s)]
*  for money throughout the world. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=174.06s)]
*  Right now, as of this recording, United States Treasury yields are going through the roof, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=176.98s)]
*  showing significant instability. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=183.01999999999998s)]
*  In other words, our bond markets are imploding as others appear to be following the lead [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=184.45999999999998s)]
*  of what Canada did in early March. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=190.92s)]
*  I've seen some reports out there that there were these secret meetings held between Prime [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=194.34s)]
*  Minister Carney and leaders in Europe when Carney went to Europe back on March 17. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=199.38000000000002s)]
*  I can't independently confirm that there were secret meetings or that Carney specifically [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  instructed European leaders and the rest of the world how to dump bonds in a way that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=210.88000000000002s)]
*  wouldn't be seen as so obvious, but that would have the intended effect of causing [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=217.7s)]
*  pain. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=225.66s)]
*  But nonetheless, there was Canadian bond sales or there were Canadian bond sales in early [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=226.66s)]
*  March. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=231.5s)]
*  So I'll let you do with that data what you want to do, but I think that's important. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=232.5s)]
*  And then, of course, end of March, you had Prime Minister Carney in one of his speeches [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=236.94s)]
*  talk about, though, how European leaders like Prime Minister Keir Starmer of the UK were [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=241.94s)]
*  reaching out to him and saying, you know what, Canada, you're right. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=247.1s)]
*  We're going to go gloves off here. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=251.66s)]
*  We're going to go elbows up here in Europe, in the UK and other places. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=253.2s)]
*  And we got to follow your lead. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=258.58s)]
*  Just here's Prime Minister Carney saying that play this clip. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=260.14s)]
*  I was speaking earlier today with the UK Prime Minister, Prime Minister Starmer. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=263.46s)]
*  He gave me a call. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=269.76s)]
*  He wanted to speak because he has come to the same conclusion that we came to a few [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=270.76s)]
*  months ago. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=279.92s)]
*  Yeah, finally. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=280.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=281.92s)]
*  Well, it's okay. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=282.92s)]
*  Better late than never. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=283.92s)]
*  Better late than never. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=284.92s)]
*  But that the world has changed and that our old relationship with the United States is [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=286.84s)]
*  over. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=298.08s)]
*  Is over. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=299.08s)]
*  Just to share some other stories with you here, like this one from Global News, the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=301.0s)]
*  Maple Leaf belongs U.S. tourist locations desperate for Canadians to return. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=307.44s)]
*  I mean, it's talking about how here in Palm Springs in California, they're heavily dependent [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=312.2s)]
*  on Canadian tourism and they've seen like a total drop. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  Washington basically saying, you know, nobody, no Canadians are showing up at all. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=322.96s)]
*  It's like a ghost town right now. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=329.24s)]
*  You also have Prime Minister Carney announcing something called a strong pass. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=332.18s)]
*  Again, further kind of fueling Canadian unity. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=336.96s)]
*  And it goes on to talk about how with Trump threatening our economy and sovereignty, Canadians [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=341.32s)]
*  are uniting to find new ways to discover and celebrate our beautiful country. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=346.96s)]
*  So many Canadians are cutting back vacations to the United States and instead making memories [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=351.16s)]
*  here at home showing our Canadian pride. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=356.58000000000004s)]
*  Today, Mark Carney's Liberal Party announced a new Canada strong pass so kids and young [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  families can better discover and celebrate Canada over the summer. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=364.18s)]
*  This builds on our announcement to connect Canadians with nature by making access to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  national parks and historic sites free for everyone this summer. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=372.42s)]
*  The Canada strong pass will provide children and youth under the age of 18 with free access [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=376.32s)]
*  to Canada's incredible national galleries and museums and free seats on the rail system [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=381.68s)]
*  when they travel with their parents and they're going to work with provinces to extend this [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=388.44s)]
*  as well. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=392.76s)]
*  It's not uncommon if you are traveling in Canada to see something like this, like this [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=393.88s)]
*  is from the Toronto Public Library. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=398.52s)]
*  It goes on to say, buy local, support Canadian small businesses, victory alone, every dollar [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=400.92s)]
*  spent in Canada. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=406.72s)]
*  By the way, take a look at what Elon Musk's brother Kimball Musk is saying about the sale [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=409.6s)]
*  of US bonds. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  Foreigners are selling US treasuries. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=418.0s)]
*  The trade war must end and soon the yen, the euro, and the Canadian dollar growing in value [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=419.76s)]
*  interest rates for our debt is going higher. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=423.96000000000004s)]
*  This is not the goal. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=426.32s)]
*  We have a massive deficit in higher interest rates, means higher debt payments, and we're [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=427.68s)]
*  trying to refinance our debt. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=431.76s)]
*  America is. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=433.40000000000003s)]
*  In April and May, we want our interest rates to go down. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  I talked about Whatcom County, what's going on there as well. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=438.92s)]
*  Also I think this is an important point to note. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  The buy Canadian movement is not only causing pain on the US, it's great for Canada. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=445.92s)]
*  A BMO economist are saying that the buy Canadian movement could serve as like $10 billion in [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=453.28s)]
*  stimulus to Canada and add $10 billion to the Canadian economy. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=460.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  Let me show you a little bit of Charlie Angus' speech in Cumberland now because I think it [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=466.03999999999996s)]
*  ties all of that together. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=469.44s)]
*  Here is Charlie Angus right here. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  Here he calls out Rogan and the propaganda machine. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=477.52s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  We need to know our history. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=481.68s)]
*  We need to know our stories because our stories are being denied to us by a thug who lives [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=484.16s)]
*  down in Mar-a-Lago who says we don't even have a right to a country. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=494.12s)]
*  And his loser friends like Joe Rogan said, well, maybe a candidate ever had an army. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=499.32s)]
*  Yeah, Joe, you want to mess with our guys and girls? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=505.08000000000004s)]
*  Any day, Joe, come on. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=511.12s)]
*  Nobody won't come to Canada anymore. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=512.12s)]
*  He says he's going to Russia. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=513.12s)]
*  Good. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=515.12s)]
*  You put in control. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=516.12s)]
*  Here's Charlie Angus again. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=518.12s)]
*  Let me play this clip. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=519.12s)]
*  Because it's conjured up something in us, then we let lie dormant. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=520.12s)]
*  I'll tell you what I was afraid of. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=527.04s)]
*  What I was afraid of way more than Donald Trump was that we were sleepwalking to disaster. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=530.88s)]
*  For the last three years, I have lived with this dread of a sleepwalking, that we were [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=538.84s)]
*  disconnected from one another, that we came out of COVID and we were cranky and we heard [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=547.1600000000001s)]
*  that relentless beating of the mega maple drum. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=551.96s)]
*  Canada is broken. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=556.1600000000001s)]
*  Canada is broken. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=557.64s)]
*  Canada is broken. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=559.12s)]
*  And I knew we weren't broken. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=560.12s)]
*  There's a Canada exactly, but there's a Canada that lives in my mind that I knew that I [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=561.64s)]
*  traveled and I knew communities like this existed. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=567.92s)]
*  I remember being here and thinking, but they're good people. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=571.04s)]
*  We're not broken. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=574.2s)]
*  But we were sleepwalking. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=575.72s)]
*  And if Donald Trump did anything, he woke us up. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=578.92s)]
*  Sucks to be you, Donald. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=582.32s)]
*  Once Canada wakes up, sucks to be you. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=585.8s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=589.68s)]
*  And then we began to see something happening. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=595.68s)]
*  And what's really, really powerful is that the resistance did not come from leaders. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=599.04s)]
*  It came from you. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=606.04s)]
*  It came from ordinary people who just were not going to let our democracy be taken away [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=608.52s)]
*  by thugs, who are not going to let fascists like Elon Musk decide what services we had [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=614.92s)]
*  were going to be taken away. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=622.48s)]
*  And we were never, ever going to give up a country as beautiful as this to gangsters. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=624.24s)]
*  And it was ordinary people who gave me the determination and the awareness that we were [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=631.08s)]
*  going to get through this. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=640.08s)]
*  I'll tell you about my mom. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=642.44s)]
*  My mom's a coal miner's daughter. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=644.0s)]
*  So my mom phones me early on in the Trump stuff. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=646.44s)]
*  She said, she's going through a snowstorm with her walker. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=650.0s)]
*  And this woman came up and offered to help my mom. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=655.88s)]
*  My mom said, oh, don't worry, I got this thing. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=658.36s)]
*  And then the woman said, do you think we'll get through with Donald Trump? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=660.48s)]
*  And my mom said to her, I'll eat root vegetables. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=668.48s)]
*  I don't need any of their damn asparagus. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=673.56s)]
*  I'll eat root vegetables. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=675.96s)]
*  We've been through this before. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=677.56s)]
*  And we'll get through this again. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=678.9599999999999s)]
*  And I get that not just from people like my mom. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=680.4399999999999s)]
*  I get this from all kinds of people. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=683.04s)]
*  This is the Canadian way. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=685.3199999999999s)]
*  It's the Juno Beach genes. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=687.88s)]
*  We don't stop until the job is done. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=691.16s)]
*  If there was a crappy job in the war, they gave it to Canadians all the time. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=693.8399999999999s)]
*  And Canadians got the job done. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=698.7199999999999s)]
*  We come from a long line of fascist fighters, right? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=701.3s)]
*  And we're going to fight the fascists today. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=704.52s)]
*  We are never, ever, ever, ever, ever going to give ground to fascists. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=707.24s)]
*  Finally, here's another great part of Charlie Angus's speech in Cumberland. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=711.64s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=715.48s)]
*  Taking on has a huge powerful impact. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=716.48s)]
*  Don't ever think it doesn't. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=720.0s)]
*  When you refuse to buy American, when you refuse to visit America, you are putting economic [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=722.44s)]
*  pressure that they weren't expecting because they thought that we were chumps. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=728.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=734.12s)]
*  They thought we were chumps. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=736.0s)]
*  And then we said, yeah, just try it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=738.16s)]
*  And then Pete Navarro came out and said, whoa, Canada, stop with all that hockey talk. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=742.08s)]
*  You're freaking us out. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=746.72s)]
*  It's like, man, dude, like we haven't even started yet. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=747.72s)]
*  And we haven't even set the women's team on the ice. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=753.0s)]
*  You know, they're going to be really on the run. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=755.2s)]
*  You know? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=757.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=758.44s)]
*  Because the thing is, yeah, he says he thinks there's this tap that they're going to turn [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=760.12s)]
*  on. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=769.2800000000001s)]
*  You know, and they're going to take our water and they're going to take our critical minerals. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=770.2800000000001s)]
*  There's nothing else they say they want from us. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=775.8800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they say they don't need anything, but there's something they do need to take from [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=778.32s)]
*  us. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=783.6s)]
*  They need to take our decency. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=785.0400000000001s)]
*  They need to take our sense of the rule of law and democracy. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=787.84s)]
*  Because having a nation run by a pack of in-cell white men, they're freaked out by us. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=793.9200000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=803.84s)]
*  They're freaked out. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=804.84s)]
*  I mean, what are their terms that they're so terrified of being woke? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=805.84s)]
*  Like what? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=811.1600000000001s)]
*  They woke up one morning and it was a terrible thing. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=812.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, if I was you, Donald Trump, and I woke up and I was in your skin, I think [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=814.48s)]
*  being woke would be pretty bad too. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=818.3199999999999s)]
*  I'd go, I'd try and sleep as long as I could. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=819.88s)]
*  You know? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=823.8399999999999s)]
*  And then they're freaked out by being Antifa. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=824.8399999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=826.8399999999999s)]
*  That was their last thing. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=827.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, yeah, damn right. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=829.6s)]
*  We're anti-fascists. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=831.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=832.7199999999999s)]
*  My uncle's kicked Nazi ass all over Europe. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=833.7199999999999s)]
*  We'd do it again if we had to. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=836.04s)]
*  So yeah, we're Antifa. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=837.6s)]
*  I always like highlighting Charlie Angus. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=839.5600000000001s)]
*  His Resistance Tour is going great. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=845.64s)]
*  That was in Cumberland, British Columbia. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=847.76s)]
*  I know he's going to, he'll be in Alberta soon as well. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=849.4s)]
*  It's a great tour that he's running right there and appreciate. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=853.32s)]
*  He's given us a few shout outs there. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=859.24s)]
*  So thanks, Charlie. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_0YR3UZxs&t=860.64s)]
