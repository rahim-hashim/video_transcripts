# Trump Wakes Up to NIGHTMARE as BOTTOM FALLS OUT
**MeidasTouch:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs)
*  This is a disaster for you, Donald. The American people hate you. They see through your lies. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=0.0s)]
*  They see what a vile, deceitful, pathetic piece of trash you are. Just take a look at the Pew [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=7.2s)]
*  Research poll, some of the lowest polling numbers ever in history of presidential polling. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=14.4s)]
*  Approval rating, 40%. Disapproval, 59%. Just look at these cross tabs. When you look at his support, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=21.84s)]
*  in the black community, only 14% of black people support Donald Trump. Hispanic support, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=30.0s)]
*  only 27% of Hispanic people now support Donald Trump. Negative 45%, only 29% of Asian people [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=36.24s)]
*  support Donald Trump. How about those young people, Donald, who were listening to the podcast? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=44.08s)]
*  Did they support you anymore? Nope, only 36% support amongst people ages 18 to 29. That's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=50.08s)]
*  negative 27%. You're 27% underwater there. But you may say, hey, Ben, that's just Pew Research. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=58.16s)]
*  I'm sure Fox is saying something different. Not really. Donald Trump's approval based on the new [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=66.48s)]
*  Fox poll is the lowest in modern presidential history for the Fox poll. It is less than his [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=72.8s)]
*  first administration. Trump regime 2 approval, 44%. Compare this to former President Biden. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=79.92s)]
*  At the same time, Biden was 54%. Former President Obama was 62%. Former President Bush was 63%. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=87.52s)]
*  How about on the economy in the Fox News poll? Let's put news in quotes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=96.32s)]
*  Only 38% of Americans approve of Donald Trump's handling of the economy under the Fox poll. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  And Fox was showing these graphics over and over again yesterday. Yes, Donald, your nightmare is [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=109.36s)]
*  here. Those protests that you're scared of, they're only going to get bigger. The crowds [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=116.48s)]
*  for the events by AOC, Bernie, and other Democrats who are doing town halls and big speeches, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  those are going to get bigger. Donald, I can't wait for a summer of democracy, Donald, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=128.72s)]
*  as we've been predicting here on the Midas Touch Network. Oh, this was a question that was asked [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=135.36s)]
*  on that Fox put news in quotes poll. In general, do you think imposing tariffs or fees on products [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=140.32s)]
*  imported from other countries makes the products you buy more or less expensive? 72% of people say [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=146.08s)]
*  more, only 7% of people say less. That's bad for you, Donald. That means that even people in your [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=152.96s)]
*  own MAGA base know you're a liar because wherever you go right now, you're hearing the word tariff, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  tariff, tariff, and people know it's screwing their lives. You may claim that the price of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  eggs is down 93% and the egg price and grocery prices are so low. The problem that you say is [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=174.08s)]
*  that it's too low, but most Americans don't, all Americans, unless you're lying, don't think that's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  true because we go to the grocery store. Unlike you who thinks the word groceries is a cool word, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  right? Donald goes, have you heard the word groceries? Is that an old-fashioned word? No, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=193.44s)]
*  groceries is not an old-fashioned word. It's a word and you're making things worse. By the way, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=197.28s)]
*  one of the people who works at the Midas Touch Network, Jeremy, he gets emails like this. I'm [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=202.88s)]
*  sure you get emails like this. This is from Guitar Center. This is what companies are sending out [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=207.12s)]
*  right now and these should be three alarm fire SOS right now. This is the subject from Guitar [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=212.32s)]
*  Center. Locking up to 30% before tariffs hit. Hey Jeremy, we wanted to give you a heads up that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=218.56s)]
*  prices on gear across the board are about to rise due to new tariffs. If you've been thinking about [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=225.36s)]
*  upgrading your setup or adding new gear, now is the best time to buy before the price increases [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=231.04s)]
*  hit. We're seeing that for cars and basically everything else. Also, freight, the freight [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  industry, the shipping industry, the trucking industry, right now is getting crushed and there's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=243.28s)]
*  like a 14-day lag time where then we're going to see the scarcity. Lots of companies prepared for [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=250.0s)]
*  the worst, not all, and they bought a lot of goods in bulk, but now they're running out of supply. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=258.56s)]
*  We're about to just start running out of important things on the shelf. Remember with COVID where [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=265.12s)]
*  people couldn't find toilet paper or this or that, get ready for that again. Donald, you think we're [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=270.32s)]
*  pissed off now? Just you wait in 14 days, you idiot. Here's what we're learning about. The CEOs of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=275.92s)]
*  three of the nation's biggest retailers, Walmart, Target, and Home Depot, by the way, a lot of these [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  people, Trump supporters, privately warned him that his tariff and trade policy could disrupt supply [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  chains, raise prices, and empty shelves according to sources familiar with the meeting. The big box [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  CEOs flat out told Trump the prices aren't going up, they're steady right now, but they will go up. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  This wasn't about food, but he was told that shelves will just be empty, an administration [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=309.12s)]
*  official familiar with the meeting told Axios. Another official briefed on the meeting said the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=314.88s)]
*  CEOs told Trump the disruptions will become noticeable in about two weeks' time. Craig Fuller, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  who runs a freight analysis company, data company, here's what he's been saying. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  Year over year trucking activity out of Los Angeles now down 23%. It will likely drop [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=332.72s)]
*  to 50% in the coming weeks if there isn't a trade war resolution. Massive layoffs coming to the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=339.12s)]
*  West Coast trucking sector. And it's not just the West Coast, this story's being repeated across the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=345.44000000000005s)]
*  country. Craig Fuller repeats this story right here, spoke to a Michigan truck driver yesterday. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  He normally hauls auto parts from Michigan to Kansas. He hasn't had a load now for two weeks. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  He is getting worried. Industrial trucking is already in a recession. 80% of the trucking [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=361.52s)]
*  industry voted for Trump, but they will be among the first victims of the trade war. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=367.52s)]
*  And one of the things that Donald Trump is also doing is creating massive instability, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=372.88s)]
*  massive volatility. If you are a CFO or someone planning at a company, how do you know what Donald [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  Trump is going to do next, right? Yesterday it seemed, or two days ago it seemed like Donald [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=384.96s)]
*  Trump was going to walk back the 145% tariffs on China. It seemed like Donald Trump was going to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=390.08s)]
*  walk back the auto tariffs against the world and against Canada. And then today, when Donald Trump [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=398.0s)]
*  was speaking about Canada, for example, he said 51st state, he wants to annex Canada. He said that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=405.12s)]
*  Canada would not exist if it wasn't for the United States. He made comments that, you know, it's up [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=411.28s)]
*  to China if they want the 145% tariffs removed, that he's not going to unilaterally reduce the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=418.88s)]
*  tariffs, just going back on what he said. And then he was asked questions like, you know, your policies [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=425.52s)]
*  like disappearing human beings to concentration camps and your attacks on the sovereignty of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=431.04s)]
*  Canada, Europe and elsewhere are causing nations and causing people to boycott American products [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=437.52s)]
*  and tourism. Hey, Donald, does that bother you? For example, that there's a steep drop in international [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=444.16s)]
*  tourism. Donald Trump goes, not a big deal here. Play this clip. There's been a steep drop off [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  in international travel to the United States. It was down 12% last month, down even more from Western [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=455.20000000000005s)]
*  Europe. Why do you think that there are fewer people suddenly who want to travel to the United [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  States? Well, there could be a little net. There's a little nationalism there, I guess, perhaps. It's [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=467.44000000000005s)]
*  not a big deal. But, you know, with the dollar being where it is, because not a big deal. Goldman [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=472.08s)]
*  Sachs is predicting that's going to be a 90 billion dollar hit to the American economy. Doesn't this [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=478.8s)]
*  give you the vibes of COVID when Donald Trump was like a miracle, it's all going to go away, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=484.88s)]
*  Justin Jeff bleaching into your veins. This is all you got to do is just pretend it's not going to be [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  that bad. And then what does he do? He attacked Fauci during COVID. And now who's his fall guy? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=495.52s)]
*  Jerome Powell is Fauci 2.0. And just like during COVID, he attacks China. That's what he's [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=501.2s)]
*  literally repeating the same playbook over and over again. Then Donald Trump says Canada would [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  cease to exist without American support. Play this clip. It doesn't make sense. If we needed [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=513.92s)]
*  something, that would be a different subject. So I'm working well with Canada. We're doing very well. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=518.72s)]
*  We're working on a deal. We'll see what happens. But again, you know, why representing this country, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=526.32s)]
*  why are we spending $200 billion to support and subsidize another country? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  Because if they didn't have us, and if we didn't spend that money, as Trudeau told me, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=542.32s)]
*  they would cease to exist. He said that to me, they would cease to exist, which is true, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=548.08s)]
*  certainly as a country. Hey, Midas Mighty. So I used to have no clue what to get my mom for Mother's [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=553.12s)]
*  Day. And she'd often hit me with the, you don't have to get me anything, but I wanted to get her [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  something incredible. I didn't really know where to go though. And now it's my wife's first Mother's [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=563.36s)]
*  Day since we had our baby girl, Jimena, together. And so she also said, I don't really want anything [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=568.6400000000001s)]
*  for Mother's Day, but I want to make sure I get her something extra special. And so for both my mom [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=574.32s)]
*  and my wife, I shop at Quince. And I hope you shop at Quince too. So they've got everything from [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=579.84s)]
*  cashmere sweaters from $50, 14 karat gold jewelry, Italian leather bags, fragrances, and more. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=586.48s)]
*  And here's the thing. All Quince items are priced 50 to 80% less than similar brands. By partnering [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=593.36s)]
*  directly with the top factories, Quince cuts out the cost of the middleman and passes on the savings [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  to us. And Quince only works with factories that use safe, ethical, and responsible manufacturing [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=607.36s)]
*  practices and premium fabrics and finishes. I love that. I don't want to fully reveal the secret yet [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=613.44s)]
*  of what I got my mom, but I got her an incredible necklace and I got my wife an incredible set of [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=620.4s)]
*  earrings. I also got my mom a suitcase from Quince. This way when she visits me and her [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=626.4s)]
*  granddaughter, Jimena, she travels in style. So thank you, Quince, for that thoughtful, timeless, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=632.08s)]
*  totally her. Shop Mother's Day at Quince. Go to quince.com slash mitis for free shipping on your [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=639.52s)]
*  order and 365 day returns. That's q-u-i-n-c-e dot com slash mitis, m-e-i-d-a-s to get free shipping [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=646.24s)]
*  and 365 day returns. That's quince.com slash mitis, q-u-i-n-c-e dot com slash mitis. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=657.6s)]
*  And then throughout the day yesterday, Donald Trump was also showing these signs of severe [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=666.64s)]
*  cognitive issues. And I don't want that to be an out for him. So I don't want to emphasize the fact [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=671.84s)]
*  that he may be showing symptoms of dementia. I'm not a medical professional, although I know people [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=677.52s)]
*  in my life who have dementia or had dementia. So it certainly resembles those. But I don't want [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=683.6s)]
*  to give him an out because he's a vile, despicable person who will try to use that as an out. As he [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=689.0400000000001s)]
*  gets more desperate, as people rise up, watch, he's going to say, oh, I'm just, I wasn't mentally [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=695.9200000000001s)]
*  right. It wasn't. He'll go there down the line to try to protect himself when he's being held [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=700.8000000000001s)]
*  accountable. Just bookmark this. But here he's like, I'm suing the law firm of Perkins Cooey [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=705.9200000000001s)]
*  for their egregious and unlawful conduct. No, you're not. They're suing you for your egregious [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=711.28s)]
*  and unconstitutional executive order. And the Trump DOJ lawyer who went to the hearing yesterday [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=716.4s)]
*  got eviscerated by the federal judge for your unconstitutional conduct. By the way, then Donald [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=722.72s)]
*  Trump yesterday was, remember how he started the day? He was wandering around the North lawn of the [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=728.88s)]
*  White House. And then the media was like, what are you doing? Why are you doing this? He's like, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=734.4s)]
*  I'm building a 100 foot pole, a flagpole, a beautiful big American flagpole. That's what [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=738.72s)]
*  I'm going to be doing. So that's what he spent time doing yesterday, destroying and wrecking [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=745.84s)]
*  the American economy, talking about building a beautiful 100 foot flagpole. Oh, and by the way, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=750.32s)]
*  doing a pump and dump to his dollar sign Trump meme coin, where he made this email post about [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=756.4s)]
*  if you want to meet Donald Trump in person, the people who hold the most Trump meme coins can get [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=763.5200000000001s)]
*  to meet with him. Just show us your crypto wallet to see how much Trump meme coins you do. That [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=769.44s)]
*  caused Trump's meme coin to rise 71% right away like that before dropping again. Trump using [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=775.2800000000001s)]
*  literally access to the White House to pump the meme coin. And by the way, our economy right now [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=783.84s)]
*  looks like one gigantic pump and dump meme coin, right? Three days ago, there was that private [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=790.88s)]
*  meeting among Scott Besson, the Treasury Secretary and all the bankers where they were told that [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=796.32s)]
*  Donald Trump was going to deescalate with China and that they were going to walk back some of [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=802.24s)]
*  their tariffs that caused the markets to rise. The rest of us didn't get that information. It was [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=807.28s)]
*  done in private. So lots of people keep getting rich on the market taking and they ain't the [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=813.68s)]
*  regular folk. They're the oligarchs and the billionaires who are getting special privilege [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=818.88s)]
*  access as Donald Trump is freaking manipulating the markets only for Donald Trump today to say [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=823.28s)]
*  or yesterday to say something basically different and then pump and dump the Trump meme coin. Or [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=829.52s)]
*  at least that's what it looked like. Also to see Donald Trump attack Zelensky. Again, yesterday, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=834.7199999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump made this vile post and he was like, how dare President Zelensky talk to the [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=840.24s)]
*  Wall Street Journal about never giving up Crimea? Why is Zelensky doing that? And again, Trump just [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=846.48s)]
*  spent the whole day parodying Putin talking points. Meanwhile, what happened yesterday in Ukraine, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=853.84s)]
*  Putin launched a missile after ballistic missile at Kiev causing mass casualties while Donald Trump [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=860.5600000000001s)]
*  and his regime were in the Oval Office. Again, attacking Zelensky, making posts attacking Zelensky. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=868.5600000000001s)]
*  It was an utterly despicable and disgusting site to watch indeed. Also, you had the auto, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=875.36s)]
*  big auto manufacturing lobbying groups all united, which is pretty rare. They sent Donald Trump a [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=882.96s)]
*  letter believing Trump was going to walk back the auto tariffs. Trump indicated or Trump regime [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=888.96s)]
*  people indicated he may do that only for Trump in the press conference to say he was thinking [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=896.08s)]
*  about raising the tariffs against Canada. It's pure and utter chaos in the Trump regime. You've [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=901.28s)]
*  got Steve Bannon, one of Trump's advisors attacking Elon Musk. You've got Elon Musk getting into fights [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=908.16s)]
*  with Scott Bessent. Steve Bannon saying Musk should be audited. You've got Musk calling [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=914.88s)]
*  Scott Bessent out. Bessent calling Musk out. And by the way, at its most basic function, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=922.3199999999999s)]
*  isn't government supposed to deal with protection and safety, not engaging in cruel destruction of [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=928.8s)]
*  people's lives? But yesterday, we also learned that Trump denied emergency relief to Kentucky [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=935.3599999999999s)]
*  for flooding assistance, red state. They denied disaster relief for Arkansas and other red states [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=943.12s)]
*  as well. And we previously talked about how they denied emergency relief in North Carolina and [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSr4WVScTs&t=951.3599999999999s)]
