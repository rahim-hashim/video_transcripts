# Fox PANICS on LIVE TV over Trump MAJOR FAILURE
**MeidasTouch:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM)
*  State regime media known as Fox was panicking on live TV and they are blaming the quote left and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=0.0s)]
*  Democrats for the response to the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Catastrophic flash floods in Kerr County, Texas from the Guadalupe River [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=9.8s)]
*  Here is Kellyanne Conway on Fox saying the left is very culpable on this one here play this clip [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=14.52s)]
*  Well, Kellyanne [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  I think one thing that we always are constantly reminded of especially [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=21.64s)]
*  even in with Hurricane Helene is that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=24.44s)]
*  State and local governments are the ones that are on the front lines of defense and the federal government can help but they're not necessarily the ones to blame [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=26.44s)]
*  That's right. They're on the they're on the first level of defense [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  But they're also the ones who tend to issue the warnings and then go out to rescue and recover [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=35.56s)]
*  I mean the left is very culpable on this one. Jessica respectfully they have this playbook now number one blame Trump number two lie in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  The service of blaming Trump refer to number one and number three. Give us your thoughts never even your prayers [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=48.8s)]
*  Why aren't they out there helping with rescue and recovery? Why aren't they looking for the thermoses? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  Why aren't they crediting lifting up this hero who saved lives at 168? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  Why why isn't he a household name Trump Trump Trump and everything and it turns out all of it's just a lie [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  How despicable and it wasn't just limited to Kellyanne Conway [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=68.72s)]
*  You had another Fox host say that the left and Democrats are to blame [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=72.4s)]
*  Because they've convinced half of America that they control the weather and then they somehow talk about [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=77.7s)]
*  Obama in this here watch what they say here play this clip, you know horses [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=84.98s)]
*  It is kind of a remarkable scam that Democrats have they have this whole they've convinced half of the electorate in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=88.5s)]
*  America that the government can control the weather and that if you vote for them, they'll make the weather good [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=95.3s)]
*  But if you vote for the other people the weather is going to be bad and and i'm most remembered reminded of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=101.78s)]
*  President former president obama who as you probably recall in 2008 [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=109.38000000000001s)]
*  Ran on a campaign promise of calming the seas and he was if you voted for him [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=114.26s)]
*  He would restore the the weather to what it was supposed to be. Of course [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=118.98s)]
*  Americans gave him two shots and apparently he didn't fix the weather then after [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=124.02000000000001s)]
*  Politicizing this to randomly attack the left and the democrats as part of their state regime [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=128.34s)]
*  Propaganda routine they then have laura ingraham go on [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=135.28s)]
*  And laura ingraham says look i'm not even going to entertain anybody who politicizes this [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=139.7s)]
*  So don't you dare bring politics into this here play this clip. Well, dan [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=145.46s)]
*  I know you know people personally who've lost grandchildren and nieces and nephews as do I and it is yes [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=149.22s)]
*  And my daughter goes to texas a.m. A lot of her friends went to camp mystic [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=156.02s)]
*  It's a special place. It was a special place for so many generations and anyone trying to politicize this now [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=161.46s)]
*  Politicize this at this point [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=168.74s)]
*  I'm not even going to dignify a conversation with you. You've you've been dealing with the families and that for you know, 24 hours straight [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  Dan, thank you very much for sharing those stories tonight with us. We appreciate it [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=178.26000000000002s)]
*  And as I said, you know, they're gonna you're gonna use any opportunity to exploit a tragedy and take cheap shots at trump [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=183.54000000000002s)]
*  So don't bring politics into this the way you all defamed [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=189.86s)]
*  California governor gavin newsome and lied about the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  fires [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=198.42000000000002s)]
*  In southern california in january of this year [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=199.54000000000002s)]
*  Remember when fox was running these lies over and over again newsome didn't fireproof california, which is 100% false [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=203.06s)]
*  And by the way, it's not politicizing things to actually tell the facts of what happened in texas [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=210.98000000000002s)]
*  And what is happening in general with our national weather service with noah the national oceanic atmospheric [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=217.62s)]
*  Administration with fema the trump regime has said they are eliminating fema. They want to get rid of fema [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=224.88s)]
*  They are making major and have made major cuts to noah the national oceanic atmospheric administration and to the nws [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=230.66s)]
*  In texas, it is a fact that the key [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=238.18s)]
*  Meteorologist coordinator position someone who worked for 32 years a veteran of that office [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=242.24s)]
*  Was pushed out by doge and there were six other critical vacancies [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=248.58s)]
*  It's also a fact that the local officials in texas said that they didn't get the usual [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=252.26s)]
*  Coordination and warnings that they are used to now more investigation is needed [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=258.64s)]
*  But those are the facts about what's happening in texas and then fox tries to blame it on the left [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=262.98s)]
*  So then they have to lay on their propaganda even harder [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=269.54s)]
*  And so then they bring on jim jordan whose background was covering up sexual abuse at his prior job before becoming [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=273.06s)]
*  A maga republican member of congress and so here they go to uh, they go to him [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=280.42s)]
*  Do you think that uh, we're gonna see donald trump get a nobel peace prize and then jim jordan's like well, he deserves it [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=285.62s)]
*  Let's give him a nobel peace prize here play this clip [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=292.1s)]

*  Benjamin net yahoo at a dinner at the white house handed [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=300.98s)]
*  President trump the letter that he wrote nominating him for a nobel peace prize. Do you think that's do you think we'll see? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=304.98s)]
*  The first felon get a nobel peace prize maybe [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=312.82000000000005s)]
*  Well, he certainly deserves it but knowing how the left is and how the left seems to control so many of these institutions [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=316.58s)]
*  Um, i'm not holding my breath, but he certainly warrants it [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  He should get the nobel peace prize and god bless prime minister net yahoo [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=327.86s)]
*  For that nomination. Well, maybe they can take it away from barack obama and give it to uh, president trump [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=332.26s)]
*  Then you have maga republican congress member owens [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=337.3s)]
*  He goes on and he's like i've got an update for you democrats donald trump's a genius [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGFC4EMtETM&t=341.06s)]
