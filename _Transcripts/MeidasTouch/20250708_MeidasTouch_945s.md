# Trump GOONS do UNTHINKABLE at PLAYGROUND?!!
**MeidasTouch:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg)
*  The Trump DOJ is turning Los Angeles and cities across the United States into what looks like a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=0.0s)]
*  Hollywood war set conducting these kind of performative militaristic ice raids in [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=7.84s)]
*  communities and parks with vendors who are serving food on the streets in home depots. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=16.88s)]
*  But the consequences are not performative, are very real, and people's lives are being impacted [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=22.8s)]
*  and destroyed. I'm sure a lot of you have seen this footage by now. I'm going to show you some [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=28.88s)]
*  other footage as well. But this is what MacArthur Park in Los Angeles looked like on Monday as the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=34.0s)]
*  Trump regime put these ice agents and other federal officials. It looked like they were [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=40.96s)]
*  invading a country in a park in Los Angeles where moments before this militaristic ice presence [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=46.56s)]
*  showed up, kids were playing soccer in this once vibrant park that the Trump regime is trying to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=54.64s)]
*  terrorize our communities in Los Angeles. Here, play this clip. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=61.44s)]
*  You've got the Trump regime sending masked ice agents into department stores. I'll just give a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=64.4s)]
*  warning here that this video is a bit graphic as in the middle of a Walmart, ice agents taser and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=90.32s)]
*  tackle a man screaming in pain who was shopping in aisle 26 of the Walmart. Here, play this clip. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=97.6s)]
*  This is what they're doing in our department stores. Just to give you a view of what it looks [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=121.27999999999999s)]
*  like in LA as they bring these military vehicles that you're used to seeing in foreign war zones [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=126.8s)]
*  here. This is taken from the Citizen App. Here, I'll show you this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=134.72s)]
*  This is what it looks like in the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=137.2s)]
*  Walmart. Here, I'll show you this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=141.54s)]
*  And they're rolling up to vendors who are selling hot dogs on the streets. Here's what's happening. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=147.11999999999998s)]
*  Do you need us to do anything? We're part of a group that reports this. Do you need us to do anything? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=159.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=167.2s)]
*  Masked Gestapo roam in the streets of Los Angeles and cities across the country. And finally, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=180.48s)]
*  you have the Border Patrol Chief and the Trump regime, Greg Bovino, saying, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=185.67999999999998s)]
*  get used to it. We're going to be doing this even more. So get ready. Here, play this clip. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=190.64s)]
*  The federal government is not leaving LA. I don't work for Karen Bass. The federal government [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=195.12s)]
*  doesn't work for Karen Bass. We're going to be here until that mission is accomplished, as I said. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=200.08s)]
*  And better get used to us now because this is going to be normal very soon. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=204.4s)]
*  It's going to be normal soon until the mission is accomplished. The mission of what? Attacking [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=211.44s)]
*  hot dog vendors and hardworking people. Let's bring in California Senator Alex Padilla. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=216.56s)]
*  Can't even believe that here we are. I'll just let you react. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=223.12s)]
*  I mean, there's so much there, starting with you talked about this being performative. I mean, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=228.72s)]
*  that's ultra, ultra mild way to describe it because, you know, the MacArthur Parkinson, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=234.56s)]
*  for example, the truth is, after they staged this, you know, use of force or show of force, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=242.16s)]
*  zero people detained, zero arrested there. But I'm sure, no doubt, they got tons of great footage [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  for the next TikTok videos. And I say performative is an ultra mild way to describe it because [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=257.76s)]
*  on the flip side of it, what's happening to community? What's happening to people? You know, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=263.92s)]
*  minutes before these agents were walking through the park, the mounted agents walking through the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=269.04s)]
*  park, it was the location of a summer camp. There was a couple dozen kids at summer vacation, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=274.8s)]
*  they're not in school. It was a local park, a famous park, iconic park in Los Angeles, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=280.64000000000004s)]
*  that was hosting a summer camp. But this doesn't matter to these federal agents, doesn't matter to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=286.24s)]
*  ICE or the Department of Homeland Security. Certainly doesn't matter to Donald Trump to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=293.92s)]
*  think the fear, the terror that they're instilling in so many families, so many communities. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=297.84s)]
*  This happens to be Los Angeles, it's happening throughout the region, throughout the state, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=304.88s)]
*  and throughout the country, but nowhere more intensely and at the scale that we're seeing [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=309.84s)]
*  in Los Angeles right now. My wife is Latino, she's from Guadalajara, her family is moved here, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=314.23999999999995s)]
*  became citizens. Her family lives in HP. They asked me yesterday, they said, Ben, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=322.08s)]
*  what were they doing in MacArthur Park? Why were they doing this? What are they trying to accomplish? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=327.2s)]
*  And I had no good answer for them other than I said to my wife's mother, I said, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=334.08s)]
*  are you going to church anymore? And she goes, nope. I said, are you going to work out like you used to? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  She goes, nope. This is what they're trying to do and still this type of fear. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=344.96s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. And so in one of the clips that you showed, this is going to be normal until the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=348.88s)]
*  mission is over. What's the mission? What is the mission? I wish we had formal responses from the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=356.4s)]
*  administration and DHS, but we don't. That's not a shock for any of us. The mission is clearly [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=362.64s)]
*  not just dangerous, violent criminals. We hear that so much from Trump and folks in his administration, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=368.96s)]
*  but the numbers demonstrate otherwise. The vast majority of those that have been detained, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=376.56s)]
*  the vast majority of those arrested and the vast majority of those deported, many without due [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=382.96s)]
*  process, that's a whole other conversation, are not violent criminals, most with no criminal [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=388.32s)]
*  convictions. And so who are the folks that are being caught up in those? Who are these people [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=395.68s)]
*  being tased at Walmart when they're clearly not a threat to the ICE agents or to anybody else there? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  What kind of training are they not getting or disregarding? That's again, a whole other topic [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=406.08s)]
*  to pursue here. But the vast majority of folks that are caught up in these raids [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=410.56s)]
*  are hardworking folks. They've been here maybe a couple of years, many, many years, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=414.56s)]
*  paying taxes, raising families. They were deemed essential at the tail end of the first Trump [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=418.72s)]
*  administration, but are now being targeted by the second. Let's pursue that area of inquiry, though, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=425.2s)]
*  of the training and who are these ICE agents. We know in this disastrous budget bill, ICE will now [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=432.24s)]
*  get more funding than the United States Marines and basically any other armed forces in the entire [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=438.56s)]
*  world right now. And they're going to be rushing people to take on these ICE positions and putting [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=446.48s)]
*  more people out on the streets. What do you expect is going to happen? How does the budget bill [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  that Trump signed into law play into all of this? Yeah, well, I mean, there was a lot to detest about [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=459.36s)]
*  the bill, right? The cuts to health care access to so many other areas of the budget while giving [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=465.52s)]
*  tax breaks for billionaires and really beefing up the budget for immigration enforcement. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=471.68s)]
*  Again, if it was only a matter of targeting truly dangerous, violent criminals, I don't think there [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=478.96s)]
*  would be a discussion. I don't think there would be a debate or disagreement, but that's not [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  what's happening. And to think that ICE will now become the largest law enforcement agency in the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=488.0s)]
*  land. So Republicans and Donald Trump are increasing budgets to scale them up without a [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=494.72s)]
*  change in policy, without reigning in their cruel and extreme overreaching tactics should really [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=502.08000000000004s)]
*  worry and scare everybody because all it means is you're going to see a lot more of what we're [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=509.44000000000005s)]
*  seeing in Los Angeles and other surrounding communities. This is just not right. As I'm [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=514.4s)]
*  hoping we get a chance to talk about one of the things that we're trying to tackle with this [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=521.36s)]
*  enforcement actions gone wild is so many federal agents without any clear marks on their uniform, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=526.64s)]
*  but you don't know what department or agency they represent. They're allowed to cover up, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=534.4s)]
*  mask themselves. And so there's no way to identify them as a federal agent for the sake of the fear [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=538.88s)]
*  concerning community and for the safety of the officers themselves, because when you're getting [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=548.0s)]
*  attacked, you think you're going to be kidnapped and you don't know who it is that may be attacking [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=551.84s)]
*  you. A natural instinct to urge is to fight back. And so want to present this. It's a bill that I [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=555.44s)]
*  just introduced along with the Senator Booker from New Jersey to require the same type of no mask [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=563.04s)]
*  and identification markings on a uniform that local law enforcement in California has had for [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=569.6s)]
*  a long time and other federal departments and agencies require as well. So talk about that, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=575.28s)]
*  because I think while I think we all agree, our viewers will say that makes a lot of sense. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=581.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, it seems that Trump and the mega Republicans are going to politicize everything [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=588.4s)]
*  that you just said and said, well, that's because you want to dox them. When in reality, it's like, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=592.64s)]
*  this is unsafe. Having masked individuals disappear, human beings is unsafe for every person [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=597.68s)]
*  involved. So talk about how do you get something like this passed in this current environment? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=604.16s)]
*  And then separately, what do we the people do? I mean, people are people hate this. What would [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=610.64s)]
*  ISIS do? If you go and I've seen interviews where you give where they try to play gotcha with you, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=615.76s)]
*  they're like, well, people want strong borders. You're like, yeah, that's different. Strong [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=620.3199999999999s)]
*  borders is different than having ICE agents roam the streets and disappear. Hardworking migrants is [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=623.8399999999999s)]
*  a very different concept. But what do we what do we the people do? I know I see you're introducing [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=628.16s)]
*  that. What do we do? We're out there protesting, you know, millions of people for no kings, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=633.2s)]
*  think the protests. But what else what else can we do? And so that we don't feel hopeless in the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=638.32s)]
*  situation, right? Well, we've got to keep doing we've got to keep doing no kings protests were great. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=643.9200000000001s)]
*  It can't be a one and done. It can't be a two and done. And we've got to keep shedding light on [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=649.2s)]
*  what's really happening. Again, the misinformation disinformation come from this administration [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=653.2s)]
*  that they're only targeting dangerous violent criminals. We know is not true. The concern about [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=658.8s)]
*  potential doxing of federal agents. Well, how is it a requirement? And it seems to work with [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=664.88s)]
*  agents and other agencies within DHS and of course, other departments within the federal [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=670.88s)]
*  government. How does it seem to work for state and local law enforcement who can't just go into a [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=675.76s)]
*  home, a store, a community without the proper, you know, again, notification on their uniforms. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=681.52s)]
*  And what we're requiring is really what department agency you work for, it can even be an acronym. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=688.48s)]
*  And if having an officer or an agent's name is considered dangerous, and how about just a badge [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=694.0s)]
*  number, right? Something to be able to identify the individual for purposes of accountability. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=700.24s)]
*  You know, when it comes to law enforcement, I've been in different public offices for many years [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=707.2800000000001s)]
*  at the local level, the state level, and now at the federal level, we have a law enforcement [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=712.24s)]
*  perspective. And it's an important and valid one. We have a military perspective. That's an important [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=717.0400000000001s)]
*  and valid one. But what happened to the terminology of community police relations? There's a community [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=721.9200000000001s)]
*  piece to this too. So both for the safety of the officers, so that people know that if they respond [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=727.6800000000001s)]
*  to somebody who's seeking to detain them, are they a federal agent or not? Because when you're [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=732.88s)]
*  not identified, you just don't know. When that unidentifiable person is an unmarked card, you [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=738.0s)]
*  really don't know. And how are you going to respond? But also for the sake of community, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=743.92s)]
*  to know who it is approaching them or not. So all the way around, I think it makes a whole lot of [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=750.96s)]
*  sense. Experience in other areas of law enforcement tells us it is a workable solution, but clearly [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=756.8s)]
*  a void and a gap in the requirements for either ICE agents or other agents from other departments [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=764.7199999999999s)]
*  that are now being reassigned to conduct immigration enforcement. That wasn't their mission before, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=772.0s)]
*  and their training isn't comparable. Senator, before we go, whenever I have people like you on [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=778.24s)]
*  here, you're seeing things that I'm not seeing, that our audience isn't seeing. Is there anything [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=785.36s)]
*  that you've wanted to get out as a message that when reporters ask you questions, we have a sense [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=790.8000000000001s)]
*  of where an interview is going. But there are a lot of issues, sometimes the most important, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=797.2s)]
*  that are not being discussed enough. And so are there things that you're seeing and you're hearing [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=801.52s)]
*  that you want our audience of almost 6 million people to know right now, in addition to what [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=807.36s)]
*  we just discussed? Right. I think we've touched on a couple of them. Number one, what's really [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=812.24s)]
*  going on here? It's in no way just a focus on dangerous, violent criminals. We know the [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=816.5600000000001s)]
*  cruelty of the vast majority of people who are being targeted here. We should remind people of [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=824.08s)]
*  the lack of due process that this administration is violating. We should shed light on the cruelty, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=829.36s)]
*  the theatrics. If it's all about making Donald Trump feel better because it's an [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=840.4s)]
*  ex-great TikTok video, at whose expense? And I got to tell you, as time goes on, we're going to start [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=845.84s)]
*  feeling the economic impact of this immigration enforcement gone out of control. Because when [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=852.8s)]
*  there's less construction workers available for Los Angeles to be rebuilt, when there's less farm [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=861.52s)]
*  workers available to help put the fruit and vegetables on our dinner tables, when there's [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=867.36s)]
*  less fuel workers and meat processing plants, in transportation, in healthcare, in hospitality, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=873.28s)]
*  there's going to be an economic impact in addition to the failed tariff strategies of Donald Trump. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=879.92s)]
*  It's a bad policy and it's a bad combination. Senator, thank you for joining us. As always, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=886.8000000000001s)]
*  keep us posted. Our audience always loves hearing from you and your updates, especially that you're [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=893.84s)]
*  here in California, which now seems to be ground zero for Trump's attack. Go figure, the fourth [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=899.12s)]
*  largest economy in the world and the state that's basically subsidizing a lot of the states that [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=905.52s)]
*  vote for Donald Trump is the one that they're trying to defund and attack. I'll just leave [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=911.76s)]
*  by saying that's a very Trumpian thing to do. Senator, thanks for joining us. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=917.6s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. Everybody hit subscribe. Let's get to six million subscribers. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koaP6NPcyg&t=922.24s)]
