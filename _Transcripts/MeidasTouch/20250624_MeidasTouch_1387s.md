# Trump CANCELS MEETING after LEAK on IRAN FAILURE
**MeidasTouch:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ)
*  The latest intelligence coming out right now is that the United States' operation on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Iranian nuclear facilities was largely a failure. A centrifuge at one of the facilities remains [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=5.28s)]
*  intact. It did damage some of these nuclear facilities, but the nuclear facilities can be [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  made operational in a few months potentially. And also it's being reported as well that Iran's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  enriched uranium stockpile was largely moved before U.S. strikes, according to a new New [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=27.6s)]
*  York Times report. Also, the New York Times is confirming and exclusive by CNN that the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  nuclear sites were damaged, but they were not destroyed, rendering the mission by and large [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=40.56s)]
*  a failure. In stark contradiction to what Donald Trump was repeatedly posting over and over again, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=46.64s)]
*  Donald Trump had posted that all of the nuclear sites were absolutely obliterated. He declared an [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=53.36s)]
*  absolute success. He said that the damage to the nuclear sites were monumental, but with everything [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=59.52s)]
*  that Donald Trump says, you always have to kind of take a step back because he is always lying. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=66.48s)]
*  There was supposed to be a bipartisan briefing earlier today in the House and in the Senate. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=72.64s)]
*  It was going to be Democrats and Republicans from the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=80.0s)]
*  people with top-level classified access. This classified meeting was abruptly canceled at [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=86.08s)]
*  Donald Trump's demand. Donald Trump refused to make people from his administration accessible. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=93.04s)]
*  He claims that it was just to delay it for Thursday, but I think that, especially now as [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=100.08s)]
*  we're getting some of the information, it obviously seems that Donald Trump was trying to cover up [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=105.36s)]
*  the latest intelligence out there, which is that these operations that Trump was bragging about [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=110.4s)]
*  did not achieve the objective of the mission. Let's go through what we know right now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=115.92s)]
*  CNN dropped the exclusive early US intel assessment, suggests that the strikes on Iran [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=122.88s)]
*  did not destroy nuclear sites. The US military strikes on three of Iran's nuclear facilities [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=129.12s)]
*  last weekend did not destroy the core components of the country's nuclear program and likely only [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=135.52s)]
*  set it back by months, according to an early US intelligence assessment that was described by [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=142.4s)]
*  four people briefed on it. The assessment, which has not been previously reported, was produced by [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=148.24s)]
*  the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's intelligence arm. It is based on a battle damage [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=154.0s)]
*  assessment conducted by US Central Command in the aftermath of the US strikes, according to sources. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=160.24s)]
*  Now, I think one of the reasons that this leaked was this information was supposed to be provided [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=167.44s)]
*  in a classified setting to Congress earlier in the day before the Trump regime canceled it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=173.2s)]
*  We now have a statement out from Trump regime propagandist Caroline Levitt. She says the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=180.48s)]
*  following, the alleged assessment is flat out wrong and was classified as top secret, but was [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  still leaked to CNN by an anonymous low level loser in the intelligence community. Pause right [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=194.16s)]
*  there. So isn't she essentially admitting it right there? You take away all of the stuff they say, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  loser and all of that. But if they're saying that this was a top secret classified assessment, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=207.36s)]
*  isn't she essentially admitting that that's what the assessment said? She goes on to say, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  the leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump and discredit [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=224.08s)]
*  program. Everyone knows what happens when you drop 14,000, 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=231.76s)]
*  targets. Total obliteration. We do know what happens when the Trump regime speaks. They lie [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=240.0s)]
*  about absolutely everything and that appears to be what is taking place as well. New York Times [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  reporting the strikes set back Iran's nuclear program by only a few months. The US report says [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=253.68s)]
*  now that the New York Times has its hands on those reports as well. Also seems like the ceasefire [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=260.16s)]
*  that Donald Trump claimed existed, which we were telling you seemed to be BS as well, that that is [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  not being followed either. The latest data that we have from Israel's military chief of staff, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=273.12s)]
*  they say the campaign against Iran is not over and that strikes will almost certainly continue. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump's approval right now has sunk to 40%. His disapproval is at 50%. This is [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=287.2s)]
*  Trump's lowest approval from the Gallup poll and it's consistent with the Quinnipiac we showed you, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  the YouGov, the Reuters Ipsos, which all have them anywhere from around 38 to 40% approval. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=301.12s)]
*  Some of the worst approval rankings in presidential history at this time. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=307.68s)]
*  Okay, let's talk about Trump canceling the hearing earlier today, the classified briefing [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=313.52s)]
*  that was supposed to take place on the Hill. Democratic Congress member Jason Crow announced [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=320.0s)]
*  completely unacceptable. The Trump administration canceled our briefing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=325.52s)]
*  Congress and the American people deserve answers from the Trump administration. America does not [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  want to be pulled into another Middle East conflict. We deserve answers now. Who was supposed [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=335.68s)]
*  to be at the briefing? Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=341.68s)]
*  director of the CIA, General Dan Cain, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Christopher Landau, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=346.88s)]
*  deputy secretary of state, and Steven Feinberg, deputy secretary of defense. Marco Rubio was never [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  supposed to be there anyway. You saw the list right there. So the fact that they're using it [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=360.48s)]
*  as an excuse that Rubio is not there is total BS. One of the things that we also know as well [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  is that the Iranian parliament committee has approved a general plan to suspend all cooperation [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=372.64s)]
*  with the IAEA according to multiple news agencies and according to Iranian TV. Now, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=379.84s)]
*  this is significant because all Donald Trump has done now is cause Iran to speed up its nuclear [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=387.2s)]
*  program and now have absolutely zero oversight from the IAEA and also Iran leaning into its [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=393.44s)]
*  allies abroad, Russia, China, and North Korea, following the failed strikes by the United States. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=402.08s)]
*  I reported earlier, as New York Times did, officials were conceding that they did not know [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=409.76s)]
*  the fate of Iran's uranium stockpile, but there was lots of photographs leading up to the US [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=414.88s)]
*  strikes that showed 15 to 17 Iranian trucks going into the facility. And many people believe [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=421.36s)]
*  that that was triggered by Donald Trump announcing his intentions on social media and bragging about [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=428.72s)]
*  it at various press conferences that Donald Trump had that also we were covering here on the Midas [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=436.24s)]
*  Touch Network. So from that New York Times article, there was evidence according to two Israeli [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=442.88s)]
*  officials, now that's confirmed by our own damage assessment by our Department of Defense, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=447.68s)]
*  these Israeli officials with knowledge of the intelligence talked about how Iran had moved [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=454.0s)]
*  equipment and uranium from the site in recent days. And there was growing evidence that the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  Iranians attuned to Mr. Trump's repeated threats to take military action had removed 400 kilograms [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=463.04s)]
*  or roughly 880 pounds of uranium enriched to 60% purity. This is just below the 90% that is usually [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=470.0s)]
*  used for nuclear grade weapons. Democratic Congress member and veteran Pat Ryan, he said the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=477.6s)]
*  following, Trump just canceled a classified House briefing on the Iran strikes with zero explanation. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  The real reason, he claims he destroyed all nuclear facilities and capability. His team knows they [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  can't back up his bluster and BS. Here's what they're scared will ask. Immediately after the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=497.6s)]
*  strikes, Trump claimed the nuclear facilities were completely and totally obliterated. He lied [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=503.6s)]
*  and likely still doesn't know the full damage assessment. And now Congress member Pat Ryan [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=508.88s)]
*  posted that before we now learned that the damage assessment says that this operation was largely a [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=514.72s)]
*  failure. What he does know is that an unsuccessful strike dramatically increases the chance Iran [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=520.32s)]
*  races to break out. Vance, JD Vance admitted that they have no clue about the status of the 900 [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=526.64s)]
*  pounds of highly enriched uranium. The entire logic of the attack was that Iran was imminently [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=533.28s)]
*  building a nuclear weapon. If that's the case, not that they've shared the Intel, then the 900 pounds [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=539.36s)]
*  of the uranium is a huge problem. They also can't get their briefers on the same page. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=546.48s)]
*  Every one of the people who was supposed to come today has a different conclusion on how close Iran [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=552.16s)]
*  was to breaking out and how successful the operation was. Tulsi Gabbard probably still [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=557.2s)]
*  doesn't know it was canceled. A few other questions I prepared. How are we protecting U.S. troops in [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=562.6400000000001s)]
*  the region from the PMF and other Iranian backed militias? How are we ensuring we keep the Strait [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=569.12s)]
*  of Hormuz open? Is there elevated risk to the homeland? And something I probably should have [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=575.2800000000001s)]
*  started with, his team sure as hell wasn't ready to explain to Congress how this strike was even [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=580.88s)]
*  constitutional or why they broke long-standing precedent and only briefed Republican members of [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=586.24s)]
*  the bipartisan Gang of Eight prior to the strikes. I'm hoping for peace. I'm praying for peace, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=592.32s)]
*  but I will not and the American people cannot take Trump's lies on topics of this magnitude [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=597.76s)]
*  sitting down. Here is Democratic Congressman and Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar after the housewide [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=604.5600000000001s)]
*  classified briefing on Iran and Israel was postponed. And now we know it was likely [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=612.0s)]
*  postponed because of the damage assessment that just came out showing that the strikes [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=618.0s)]
*  were largely a failure. Here's Congressman Aguilar. Let's play this clip right here. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=623.12s)]
*  Good afternoon. Members, today we're supposed to receive a classified briefing from the Trump [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=628.64s)]
*  administration, but clearly the chaos and the confusion coming out of the White House made [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=634.48s)]
*  that impossible. It is completely unacceptable that Congress has not been briefed on this in a [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=640.72s)]
*  timely fashion. We need evidence, we need details, and we need to know them now. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  There are a number of outstanding questions, including whether this attack achieved the [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=654.08s)]
*  administration's stated goals. Launching an attack without congressional authorization is wrong. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=658.96s)]
*  Launching a potentially unsuccessful attack without congressional authorization would be [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=665.76s)]
*  an administration defining failure. If you're like me, instead of learning to skateboard, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=671.52s)]
*  you wish you were learning to write code. And instead of scraping through college, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=676.16s)]
*  you wish you bought Bitcoin at less than a cent or secured a few Nvidia shares before they boomed. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=679.4399999999999s)]
*  We might be the FOMO generation, but don't miss out on protecting your future. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=684.24s)]
*  For around the same price per month as one of your streaming services, you can break our [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=688.3199999999999s)]

*  House, Maga Mike Johnson. When he was asked about the success of the strikes, he responded that [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=772.0s)]
*  we're under no illusions that you can just kill all their nuclear ambitions overnight. Here, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=778.24s)]
*  play this clip. After we crash them, I just tell you that right now, Mr. Speaker, Reuters is [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=783.84s)]
*  reporting Iran's nuclear chief says we're going to immediately start reconstituting our nuclear [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=789.6s)]
*  program. I mean, that's how you negotiate. Are you kidding me? It's madness. I mean, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=795.6s)]
*  we're under no illusion that you can just kill all their nuclear ambition overnight. But I think [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=802.64s)]
*  reality has set in over there. We have decimated the upper echelon of their military command as [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=807.44s)]
*  well as their nuclear scientist. I mean, there's not much left for them to rebuild the pond, but [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=813.12s)]
*  the idea that they would put out a statement like that at this fragile moment is very frustrating. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=818.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, it's funny you say that, Maga Mike, because Donald Trump is under that delusion or illusion [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=823.6s)]
*  because he's claiming that there's now peace and everything is great. And all of his posts today [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  was the war is over, we're done, it's called the 12-day war, I did it. Donald Trump keeps posting [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=835.28s)]
*  memes that says Trump was right about everything when he's wrong and lies about everything. Maybe [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=842.48s)]
*  that's what the meme should say. He's posting weird paintings of himself with his fist up. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=849.04s)]
*  And then the Maga Republican Congress members and senators and propagandists on Fox yesterday, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=855.04s)]
*  they were all out there saying Trump should win a Nobel Peace Prize for what he did. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=860.9599999999999s)]

*  Play this clip. Absolutely. Look, President Trump is going to win the Nobel Peace Prize, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=875.36s)]
*  no doubt. You look at what he's done with the Congo and Rwanda. You look at where he is with [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=881.28s)]
*  Pakistan and India and what he's done there. And then you look at this, what everyone talked about, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=886.88s)]
*  but no one thought was possible. He has brought peace to a region that needed stability. He has [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=892.16s)]
*  shown what America first policy actually is. He's make sure that he's preserving American life. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=898.24s)]
*  Here's Kayleigh McEnany saying that Trump should get a peace prize. Play this clip. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=904.08s)]
*  So rather than World War III, we may get more peace. And rather than 34 felony counts, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=908.4000000000001s)]
*  President Trump may end up with 34 Nobel Peace Prizes. That was for the leftist. You can clip [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=913.36s)]
*  this and make it go viral and go nuts. And here's Don Jr. posting, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=917.5200000000001s)]
*  affirmative action is when Barack Obama gets the Nobel Peace Prize instead of Donald Trump. So they [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=922.5600000000001s)]
*  also have to make like a racist remark as well. And then our editor in chief, Ron Filipkowski, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=929.68s)]
*  goes, they're really upset about this peace prize thing. And that's what I've been saying all along. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=934.4s)]
*  Donald Trump wanted those photographs of him in the Situation Room looking like a tough guy. If [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=940.2399999999999s)]
*  you look at Donald Trump's Instagram feed, it's all posts of himself in the Situation Room acting [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=946.4799999999999s)]
*  tough and looking tough. But at the end of the day, what we saw here was nothing more than just [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=953.4399999999999s)]
*  complete and absolute weakness. By the way, Donald Trump earlier today, when he was asked [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=958.64s)]
*  about some of the reporting from CNN and MSNBC, when some of the data started to come in that [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=965.76s)]
*  the strikes on the Iranian nuclear sites were not a success, he started just saying CNN is scum, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=972.56s)]
*  MSDNC is scum. He said that it's demolished. Here's what he had to say. Here, play this clip. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=978.8s)]
*  I think it's been completely demolished. I think the reason we're here is because [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=988.8s)]
*  those pilots, those B-2 pilots did an unbelievable job. And you know, the fake news, like CNN in [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=992.96s)]
*  particular, they're trying to, you know, they're trying to say, well, I agree that it was destroyed, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=998.96s)]
*  but maybe not that destroyed. You know what they're doing? They're really hurting great pilots that [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1004.0s)]
*  put their lives in the line. CNN is scum. And so is MSDNC. They're all, and frankly, the networks [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1008.4s)]
*  aren't much better. It's all fake news, but they should not have done that. Those pilots hit their [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1015.36s)]
*  targets. Those targets were obliterated and the pilots should be given credit. They're not after [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1021.04s)]
*  the pilots. They're after me. They want to try and demean me. When Marco Rubio was asked on Sunday [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1026.08s)]
*  if our intelligence actually showed that Iran had nuclear-grade capability, noticed that Secretary [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1033.68s)]
*  of State Rubio said that that's irrelevant. Wouldn't that be the most relevant thing? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1040.64s)]
*  Here, play this clip. Are you saying there that the United States did not see intelligence that [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1046.0s)]
*  the Supreme Leader had ordered weaponization? That's irrelevant. I see that question being [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1052.16s)]
*  asked on the media. That's an irrelevant question. That is the key point in U.S. intelligence [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1059.76s)]
*  assessment. You know that. No, it's not. Yes, it was. No, it's not. The political decision had not been made. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1063.76s)]
*  I know that better than you know that, and I know that that's not the case. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1067.52s)]
*  But I'm asking you whether the order was given. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1070.08s)]
*  And the people who say that, it doesn't matter if the order was given. They have everything they [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1072.4s)]
*  need to build nuclear weapons. Why would you bury things in a mountain 300 feet under the ground? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1076.24s)]
*  Why would you bury six? Why do they have 60% enriched uranium? You don't need 60% enriched [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1081.84s)]
*  uranium. The only countries in the world that have uranium at 60% are countries that have nuclear [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1086.4s)]
*  weapons because they can quickly make it 90. They have all the elements. Why do they have a space [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1091.04s)]
*  program? Is Iran going to go to the moon? No, they're trying to build an ICBM. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1096.32s)]
*  No, but that's a question. That's a question. That's a question of intent. And you know, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1099.6s)]
*  in the intelligence assessment that it was that Iran wanted to be a threshold. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1103.2s)]
*  How do you know what the intelligence assessment says? I'm talking about the public [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1107.12s)]
*  March assessment. And that's why I was asking you if you know something more from March. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1110.8799999999999s)]
*  But that's also an inaccurate representation of it. That's an accurate representation of it. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1114.56s)]
*  That's not how intelligence is read. That's not how intelligence is used. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1118.8s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump is in The Hague right now, where he is currently, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1122.08s)]
*  which is in the Netherlands, where he was currently getting booed as his car pulled up. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1126.8799999999999s)]
*  Let me show you that. Let's play this clip. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1131.28s)]
*  And finally, you heard from me, me there. Let me share with you how this was reported [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1143.52s)]
*  by CNN moments ago and hat tipped to them. They broke this. They broke this exclusive. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1148.16s)]
*  Here's what they had to say. Play this clip. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1153.52s)]
*  That's right. So this is an assessment that actually is out from the Defense Intelligence [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1177.8400000000001s)]
*  Agency. That is the Pentagon's intelligence arm. And it was based on a battle damage assessment [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1182.48s)]
*  conducted by U.S. CENTCOM after the strikes, according to one of the sources. Let's go to CNN [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1188.0800000000002s)]
*  national security correspondent, Natasha Bertrand, who has this exclusive new reporting. This is to [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1193.68s)]
*  that question that has been asked about how much damage has been done. This is a real question. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1201.3600000000001s)]
*  It's also a political question that has been to something that Donald Trump has been sort of [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1207.28s)]
*  dealing with here recently. What are you learning, Natasha? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1213.92s)]
*  Yeah, look, Brianna, this is the first assessment that we are getting that the U.S. intelligence [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1217.68s)]
*  community has found about the battle damage that resulted from those U.S. military strikes on these [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1221.68s)]
*  three Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. And as you said, it was produced by the Defense [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1227.76s)]
*  Intelligence Agency, which is the Pentagon's intelligence arm. And it is worth noting that it [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1232.64s)]
*  is a very early assessment. The strikes were only a matter of days ago and the intelligence [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1237.1200000000001s)]
*  community is still gathering intelligence. They are still working to come up with a full, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1241.2s)]
*  comprehensive picture of what exactly happened here. But based on a battle damage assessment [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1245.68s)]
*  that was carried out by U.S. Central Command, essentially looking at the images and looking [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1250.8000000000002s)]
*  at what was actually damaged, the Defense Intelligence Agency has assessed that the [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1254.96s)]
*  core components of Iran's nuclear program are largely intact and that Iran's nuclear program [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1259.6s)]
*  has essentially only been set back by months. Now, we presented this information to the White [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1265.36s)]
*  House for comment and White House Press Secretary Carolyn Levitt. She did acknowledge the existence [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1270.7199999999998s)]
*  of this assessment, but she said in a statement that the administration disagrees with it. She [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1276.0s)]
*  said, quote, This alleged assessment is flat out wrong and was classified as top secret, but was [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1280.7199999999998s)]
*  still leaked to CNN by an anonymous low level loser in the intelligence community. The leaking [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1286.16s)]
*  of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump and discredit the brave [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1290.5600000000002s)]
*  fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1295.3600000000001s)]
*  Everyone knows what happens when you drop 14, 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets. Total [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1300.48s)]
*  obliteration. Now, it is worth noting here that there has been dissent, I should say, within the [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1306.5600000000002s)]
*  intelligence community, within the defense community about just how much of an impact [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1312.24s)]
*  these massive bunker buster bombs would actually have on Iran's nuclear facilities. It was far from [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1317.2s)]
*  certain given that these bombs had never been tested in an actual combat scenario, whether they [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1321.76s)]
*  would actually penetrate those very, very deep underground tunnels that lie underneath these [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1326.3200000000002s)]
*  nuclear facilities. And what we are told is that as of now, this Defense Intelligence Agency [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5hUY_58RbQ&t=1332.5600000000002s)]
