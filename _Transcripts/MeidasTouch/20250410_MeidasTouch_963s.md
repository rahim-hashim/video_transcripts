# MAGA Mike gets HUMILIATED by HIS OWN PARTY on Vote
**MeidasTouch:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk)
*  Speaker of the House of Representatives, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike Johnson, just got humiliated by his own party on the floor in the House of Representatives. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=2.0s)]
*  Mike Johnson was promising Donald Trump that he'd be able to deliver the passage of the Senate budget blueprint, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=9.5s)]
*  which was recently passed, that the House would adopt that. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=20.2s)]
*  Then they would go further into the reconciliation process [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=23.6s)]
*  to ultimately pass this horrific budget that would gut $880 billion in Medicaid, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=27.599999999999998s)]
*  $400 billion in education, close to the same amount in agriculture, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=34.4s)]
*  and then also completely revoke the authority of Congress to assert its lawful authority over tariffs [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=40.4s)]
*  and allow Donald Trump to basically do whatever he wants. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=50.099999999999994s)]
*  Also, Mike Johnson put this Senate budget blueprint for a vote in the House of Representatives. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=53.1s)]
*  Now, for those who know the procedures in the House, you don't do that if you think you're going to lose. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=59.6s)]
*  It's an embarrassing thing for a speaker to be kind of stood up by their own party. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=65.9s)]
*  That's precisely what happened yesterday. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=72.0s)]
*  Mike Johnson was waiting in the House floor for like 80 minutes. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=74.6s)]
*  First, it was 30 minutes, 60 minutes, then 80 minutes. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=78.9s)]
*  And then it was clear that MAGA Mike was not going to have the votes from his own party in order to pass the Senate blueprint. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=82.5s)]
*  Now, this follows Donald Trump the night before, on Tuesday night, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=91.8s)]
*  speaking before all the MAGA Republican Congress members at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=96.8s)]
*  and Donald Trump basically threatening them all, you better vote for this or else. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=104.6s)]
*  They did not line up and actually vote for it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=109.7s)]
*  Now, that could change today. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=112.9s)]
*  But you take a look right here, Hallie Talbot, who does a great job covering this stuff, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=114.7s)]
*  has the following spreadsheet about how the budget vote that MAGA Mike promised he would get done was punted over this extra day. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=119.0s)]
*  There's about 20-ish members, MAGA Republicans, who aren't voting for this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  The House is supposed to leave for a two-week recess today. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=132.8s)]
*  But MAGA Mike Johnson says, I'm going to keep you over the weekend right now if you don't vote for this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=136.9s)]
*  Take a look at this spreadsheet that she prepared right here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, if you listen to what the MAGA Republicans are saying, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=146.8s)]
*  they're saying that the Senate budget blueprint only has about $4 billion in cuts, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=150.1s)]
*  whereas the MAGA Republicans say that their House blueprint calls for $1.5 trillion in cuts. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=158.9s)]
*  There's also kind of a dispute over this wonky-ish language over the Trump tax cuts [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=166.5s)]
*  and putting forward these Trump tax cuts for the billionaires [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=173.3s)]
*  and how that's going to be calculated in order to pretend that it's not going to add at least $4 trillion to the deficit. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=178.2s)]
*  So, you have all of this infighting taking place. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=185.3s)]
*  But there was MAGA Mike waiting 80 minutes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=188.2s)]
*  The process blew up yesterday, and now he's got to kind of wrangle everybody together. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=191.0s)]
*  Is Donald Trump going to call and start threatening all the MAGA Republican Congress members? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=197.1s)]
*  Let me show you this clip right, because they didn't respond to the threats from Tuesday night. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  I'll tell you that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  Here's MAGA Mike Johnson saying yesterday that he was still going to put this for a vote. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=206.3s)]
*  He thought he'd get it done, but he did not get it done. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=211.9s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=214.6s)]
*  We'll see when that time is. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=220.9s)]
*  We're very, very positive, productive discussions. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=222.1s)]
*  Everybody's moving forward, and I'm really pleased with the dialogue. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=225.9s)]
*  That sounds like you're short. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=228.9s)]
*  That sounds like you're short. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you what the number is, but I'll tell you I'm optimistic as I always am, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=231.6s)]
*  and we're working towards that final consensus. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=236.4s)]
*  Will the Senate have to put down its cuts? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  The Senate will have to put down the cuts they'll agree to before this vote happens tonight? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=241.4s)]
*  Look, I don't think so. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=245.4s)]
*  There's a lot of good faith dialogue and discussion going on between leaders in both chambers, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=246.7s)]
*  and that's been very productive. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=251.2s)]
*  It's a one-team approach, and I think we're going to continue that for the next couple of hours, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=252.5s)]
*  and we'll see where we land tonight. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=256.7s)]
*  How late will you stay? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=258.0s)]
*  How late will you stay tonight? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=259.09999999999997s)]
*  As Jake Sherman, who covers this every day for the past very long period of time, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=261.09999999999997s)]
*  the comings and goings of Congress, he said, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=267.3s)]
*  I've never quite seen anything like this in my career. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=269.09999999999997s)]
*  He also said this is supposed to be the easy part of reconciliation right here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=272.5s)]
*  So what? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=278.8s)]
*  Now, MAGA Mike Johnson is going to try to go to a conference with House leadership and Senate leadership [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=279.3s)]
*  in order to bridge the difference between $4 billion in cuts from the Senate [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=285.4s)]
*  and $1.5 trillion in spending cuts from the MAGA Republicans in the House, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=290.6s)]
*  as Jake Sherman says, got it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=295.4s)]
*  Easy enough. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=297.6s)]
*  Makes a ton of sense right here. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=298.7s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=300.5s)]
*  Manu Raju from CNN. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=301.2s)]
*  He does a good job reaching out to these MAGA Republican Congress members and others outside of Capitol Hill. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=302.4s)]
*  Here, he's talking about people. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=308.5s)]
*  He spoke to MAGA Republicans like Tim Burchett and others. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=311.0s)]
*  Watch this right here. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=315.0s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=316.8s)]
*  While we're bringing it up for a vote right now, it clearly doesn't have the votes. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  There's, I know, over 12 members that are planning to vote against it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=321.2s)]
*  You're firm now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=327.8s)]
*  What is it? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  Currently. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=329.5s)]
*  It looks like there's 15 members that are holding out right now. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=330.3s)]
*  So unless something changes, if you can't pass it, you pass it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=333.2s)]
*  So you do something better. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=338.6s)]
*  They use the Rules Committee resolution to circumvent U.S. law. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=339.7s)]
*  So that's the difference. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=345.3s)]
*  What's their reaction to that? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=346.6s)]
*  It's illegal. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=348.6s)]
*  Now, here's MAGA Republican Congress member Andy Biggs. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  He's a holdout as well, not approving the Senate budget blueprint. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=353.7s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=358.8s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  Here's a bunch of other MAGA Republican Congress members saying that they're not [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=388.8s)]
*  going to vote for this blueprint, like Ralph Norman and Chip Roy and Thomas Massey and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=406.6s)]
*  others. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=412.5s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=413.0s)]
*  This budget, are you a hard no on it? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=414.0s)]
*  I've got to see the proof. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=418.5s)]
*  It's all about math. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=419.7s)]
*  We got a arithmetic problem. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=421.3s)]
*  Four billion versus two, three is a little bit of difference. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=423.8s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=430.4s)]
*  So you think the Senate's plan just does not add up? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=431.4s)]
*  Why didn't they put it in there? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=433.8s)]
*  Show, give us some assurances. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=435.4s)]
*  There's a lot of mistrust in that process right now. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=436.6s)]
*  So we're trying to work through that right now with a bunch of members. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=439.4s)]
*  I am a no on this bill as it stands. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=441.4s)]
*  Oh, you know, I had to do it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=444.0s)]
*  Moink. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=446.4s)]
*  Four companies control over 80% of the US meat industry. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=447.8s)]
*  China now controls the largest portion of US pork. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=451.90000000000003s)]
*  These companies are using mobster like tactics to crush American family farms. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=455.6s)]
*  And with the additives they're putting into our food, Americans are stuck with sketchy [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=462.1s)]
*  meat. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=467.5s)]
*  So what can we do about it? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=467.90000000000003s)]
*  Let me tell you about a company that's coming up swinging on behalf of American family farms [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=469.2s)]
*  and your family's food security. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=474.5s)]
*  It's called Moink. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=476.70000000000005s)]
*  As I said at the beginning, Moink Moink. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=477.8s)]
*  The business is simple. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=479.8s)]
*  Moink's meat comes from animals raised outdoors where a pig is free to be a pig. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=481.20000000000005s)]
*  Their farmers are given an honest day's pay for an honest day's work and they deliver [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  meat straight to your doorstep at prices that you can actually afford. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=491.40000000000003s)]
*  Born, raised and harvested right here in the United States. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=495.5s)]
*  Support American family farms and join the Moink movement today at moinkbox.com. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=499.5s)]

*  They're the best wings you'll ever taste for free, but for a limited time. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=510.1s)]
*  Here's how you spell it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=514.1s)]
*  M O I N K box dot com slash Midas Touch. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=515.3s)]
*  That's moinkbox dot com slash Midas Touch. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=521.3s)]
*  Here was MAGA Republican Congressmember Chip Roy on the House floor. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=525.2s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=528.9s)]
*  The Senate sent over a joke and we're going to capitulate to the Senate knowing full well [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=529.9s)]
*  that the Senate instructions carry the day and we're going to be sitting there in a reconciliation [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=535.0s)]
*  debate where we're going to end up on the short end of the stick. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=540.1999999999999s)]
*  But worse the American people are going to end up on the short end of the stick because [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=543.5s)]
*  it absolutely increases deficits. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=546.5s)]
*  No one can deny it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=549.3s)]
*  Anyone wants to get in a room and come debate me with a whiteboard. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=551.0s)]
*  Show me the math at some point. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=554.3s)]
*  If you're in Congress pass a math test because the Senate bill doesn't add up. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=556.4s)]
*  It will destroy this country with more deficits and the inflation tax that is crippling the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=561.5s)]
*  average American family. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=566.0s)]
*  I will not vote for the Senate bill. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=567.5s)]
*  Now here was MAGA Mike Johnson also indicating that he was not going to do any sort of checks [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=569.9s)]
*  and balances as it relates to Trump's tariffs and he was just going to give Donald Trump [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=577.8s)]
*  carte blanche authority to do whatever he wants on tariffs. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=583.2s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=587.0s)]
*  Mr. Speaker. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=588.0s)]
*  I'm not sure yet. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=589.0s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, there's a push by some of your members to give Congress a say. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=590.5s)]
*  Donald Macon has a bill to give Congress a say and review the tariffs. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=594.5s)]
*  Why not give Congress the opportunity to have it be a check out? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=598.5s)]
*  Congress will weigh in on it but with the President, with the administration in tandem [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=603.5s)]
*  and I think you've got to give the President the latitude, the runway to do what it is [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=608.5s)]
*  he was elected to do and that is get this economy going again and get our trade properly [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=614.1s)]
*  balanced with other countries. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=618.3s)]
*  So I think most of the American people understand the necessity of that. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=619.5s)]
*  Now one of the language that was being inserted into this budget blueprint and this budget [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=623.0s)]
*  in order to give Donald Trump full tariff authority was to basically talk about Donald [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=630.0s)]
*  Trump's emergency power, like Donald Trump's asserting special like wartime emergency powers [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=637.0s)]
*  to do these tariffs because the power of tariffing is quite literally the power of [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=644.0s)]
*  Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=651.0s)]
*  The MAGA Republicans in the House and the Senate are letting Donald Trump just do this [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=654.0s)]
*  without the House and Senate's oversight. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=659.0s)]
*  Like it's a complete abdication of the co-equal branch of Congress by the MAGA Republican [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=662.0s)]
*  Congress members. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=668.5s)]
*  What they're doing in the budget is they put language that says that it won't count as [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=670.0s)]
*  a calendar day, any kind of discussion or debate over the tariffs so that it can't even [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=676.4s)]
*  be discussed during the next what six to nine month period because they're not even saying [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=684.46s)]
*  discussion of tariffs constitutes a actual calendar day. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=692.24s)]
*  I mean the feud between these MAGA Republicans is growing as well. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=698.0s)]
*  You have MAGA Republican Congress member Stubbe. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=703.0s)]
*  Stubbe Stubbe Doo says to MAGA Mike Johnson, where are you? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=707.0s)]
*  He didn't say that. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=712.0s)]
*  He said, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus, MAGA Mike Johnson. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=713.0s)]
*  In the name of Jesus, you are rebuked, MAGA Mike Johnson. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=716.0s)]
*  You know, it is interesting to point out as well that in MAGA Mike Johnson's district, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=720.0s)]
*  nearly 40% of the people in his district are on Medicaid, rely on Medicaid, and the House [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=727.0s)]
*  budget basically totally guts Medicaid. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=736.0s)]
*  They're like, oh, it doesn't cut Medicaid. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=739.0s)]
*  It does. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=740.0s)]
*  They bury it in, oh, we're just dealing with this specific committee. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=741.0s)]
*  It's say goodbye to Medicaid under the House budget. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=745.0s)]
*  What I do like though is the Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, calling MAGA Mike Johnson [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=748.0s)]
*  out. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=753.0s)]
*  He sent a letter saying, let's debate on the House floor, MAGA Mike Johnson. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=754.0s)]
*  I won't rebuke you in the name of Jesus. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=758.0s)]
*  I'll just do a debate. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=761.0s)]
*  Why don't we show the American people what we think about this? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=762.0s)]
*  This way you can tell the American people how you want to go after Social Security and [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=765.0s)]
*  Medicaid and just justify it. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=770.0s)]
*  Let's talk leader to leader. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=772.0s)]
*  Let's do a debate. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=774.0s)]
*  Of course, MAGA Mike Johnson's too scared to do it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=775.0s)]
*  So Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries took the floor yesterday. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=778.0s)]
*  And here's what he had to say. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=781.0s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=783.0s)]
*  And the Republican budget proposal that would enact the largest Medicaid cut in American [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=784.0s)]
*  history in order to pass massive tax breaks for your billionaire donors like Elon Musk. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=790.0s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, I'm ready to yield. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=798.0s)]
*  I'm ready to debate. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=801.0s)]
*  One on one on this House floor. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=803.0s)]
*  And I promise not to rebuke you in the name of Jesus. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=806.0s)]
*  Here in America, we were told, we were told by Donald Trump and House Republicans that [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=817.0s)]
*  that you were going to lower the high cost of living for everyday Americans. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=828.0s)]
*  In fact, we were told that you were going to do it on day one. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=833.0s)]
*  And it hasn't happened. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=837.0s)]
*  Love that. Love that clip right there. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=839.0s)]
*  And just to remind you, here's what Donald Trump was saying to the MAGA Republicans Tuesday [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=841.0s)]
*  night to try to force them to pass this budget blueprint on Wednesday, which they refused [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=848.0s)]
*  to do. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=855.0s)]
*  And here's what Donald Trump said to the MAGA Republicans. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=856.0s)]
*  And here's what Donald Trump said to the MAGA Republicans. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=859.0s)]
*  And here's what Donald Trump said to the MAGA Republicans. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=862.0s)]
*  And here's what Donald Trump said to the MAGA Republicans. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=865.0s)]
*  And here's what Donald Trump said to the MAGA Republicans. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=868.0s)]
*  And here's what Donald Trump said to the MAGA Republicans. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=871.0s)]
*  And here's what Donald Trump said to the MAGA Republicans. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=874.0s)]
*  And here's what Donald Trump said to the MAGA Republicans. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=877.0s)]
*  And here's what Donald Trump said to the MAGA Republicans. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=880.0s)]
*  The seats and we'll have something that's going to be smooth sailing for years to come. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=883.0s)]
*  If we don't get it done because of stupidity or a couple of people that want to show how [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=888.0s)]
*  great they are, you just have to laugh at them or smile at them or cry right in their [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=892.0s)]
*  face. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=898.0s)]
*  And so a big defeat for MAGA Mike Johnson and Donald Trump. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=899.0s)]
*  Now the MAGA Republicans have to bridge the Senate's blueprint. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=902.0s)]
*  Four billion in cuts. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=909.0s)]
*  The House Blueprint, 1.5 trillion. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=910.0s)]
*  And that's where we're at. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=913.0s)]
*  So we will see what happens right there. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=915.0s)]
*  And then we're staring down issues regarding the debt ceiling and what's going to happen [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=917.0s)]
*  there and will there eventually be a default? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=922.0s)]
*  And when will this whole bill go through the reconciliation process? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=926.0s)]
*  And again, this is supposed to be the easy part because they're just agreeing on blueprints. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=931.0s)]
*  Like they're not even getting into the weeds yet of the numbers. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=936.0s)]
*  This is supposed to be the easiest part because it just BS blueprints basically. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=939.0s)]
*  Then it gets to like the actual cuts in the weeds, but we're not even there yet. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=943.0s)]
*  So things are going to get crazy. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=947.0s)]
*  Anyway, hit subscribe. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=949.0s)]
*  Let's get to five million subscribers. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvinekylDk&t=950.0s)]
