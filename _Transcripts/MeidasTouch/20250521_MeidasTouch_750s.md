# Dem Senator DESTROYS Trump after PRESS MELTDOWN
**MeidasTouch:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q)
*  I'm joined by Senator Raphael Warnock. Senator Warnock, let's just talk about the humanity of it all. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Set aside the politics for a second, because all of these actions by the Trump administration [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=7.36s)]
*  at a very basic level just seem to be cruel and inhumane, targeting the most vulnerable. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  I think too much we talk about the politics and not just the human aspect. I like that you talk [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=21.2s)]
*  to the human aspect of it all. So what do you make of it all? Well, look, the first objective of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=26.32s)]
*  government is to ensure that the people are protected and that they can make the best out [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=32.88s)]
*  of their lives. Washington Republicans led by Donald Trump are focused on billionaires. They [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=38.0s)]
*  are not focused on the most vulnerable. They're focused on those who are most well connected. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=43.68s)]
*  And there's no explanation otherwise for this type of policy that would literally take health care [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=49.52s)]
*  from children in order to give billionaires a tax cut. That's what they're up to. They'll name it [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  and try to frame it in various ways. But at the end of the day, this is about giving billionaires [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=64.32s)]
*  a tax cut on the backs of the poorest and most vulnerable and those who can't afford high price [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=72.8s)]
*  lobbyists here in Washington, D.C. How do you think we connect that, though, to the people? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=78.56s)]
*  To let people get it? Because what these MAGA Republicans are good at, what Trump's good at, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=84.24s)]
*  they'll give it a marketing slogan, big, beautiful bill. They'll do the whole culture war things. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=91.84s)]
*  The media regurgitates that. So how do you break through in a state like Georgia? How do you speak [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=98.0s)]
*  to the people and say, you realize they're literally just stealing from you and then giving it to rich [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  people? Well, I'm glad you asked that question because I released a report just last week, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=108.56s)]
*  and that's what this is about. One of the things that they're trying to do is make this about [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=113.2s)]
*  work requirements, as they call it. The issue is that they are looking for $800 billion [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=120.16s)]
*  and there's not that much waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid, not $800 billion worth, not even close. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  So they use tricks. They use schemes. They use scams, like so-called work requirements. It's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  really work reporting requirements because the data shows, my report shows, that if you really want [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=141.84s)]
*  more people to work, if you want to strengthen the workforce, the way to do that is to make [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=149.92s)]
*  the workforce healthier, to give people a basic safety net of health care. And when you burden [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=156.4s)]
*  people who are already working, sometimes two jobs and trying to make it through school, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  with having to literally account for themselves month after month, what you're really doing is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=170.56s)]
*  increasing the likelihood that they will not be able to get the health care, that they will not [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=176.16s)]
*  access it. I'm not telling you my opinion. I'm telling you that this is what the CBO, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=183.2s)]
*  the Congressional Budget Office, nonpartisan entity, said that the result of this is that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=188.0s)]
*  we're going to see about seven million people kicked off of the Medicaid rolls. And apparently, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=193.76s)]
*  that is the point. That is what they want to do in order to justify an unnecessary tax cut [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=200.88s)]
*  for billionaires like Elon Musk. One of the things I'm very focused on here, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=207.2s)]
*  and I think it's often the things that deserve the most attention, get the least attention, is [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=212.64s)]
*  Donald Trump denied FEMA aid to Georgia. Republican Governor Brian Kemp requested [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=218.88s)]
*  supplemental aid from Hurricane Helene. Trump rejected that initially. We're heading into [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  hurricane season on June 1st, and we're seeing how slow, if at all, FEMA is reacting to the deaths of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  28 people who have died based on these horrible tornadoes in Missouri and Kentucky and Indiana. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=238.96s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't even talk, doesn't even mention that this took place, which to me is an [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=245.92s)]
*  unfathomable thing for the President of the United States not to acknowledge. We just had a mass [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=251.44s)]
*  casualty event caused by horrible storms, and the President doesn't even mention it. And then I'm [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=256.24s)]
*  looking at the future of what's going to happen as we've destroyed these agencies with storms like [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=261.44s)]
*  that, and that frightens me, and it also frightens me, Senator, that it's not getting enough attention. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=267.28s)]
*  I think he's a little busy working on his meme coin and trying to upgrade his [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=273.67999999999995s)]
*  new Qatari jet. Meanwhile, ordinary folks in Georgia are trying their best to make their [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=281.11999999999995s)]
*  lives work. I've been on the front lines when these storms have hit our state. I know what it [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  has done to rural communities in particular, to farming, to farmers, to the agricultural sector of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=296.32s)]
*  our state, and it's the reason why I've always been willing to work with other leaders, Democrat [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  and Republican. I've worked with the Republican governor of Georgia when we've had to respond [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=312.08s)]
*  to that state with hurricanes, with tornadoes, with making sure that people in the middle of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=316.96s)]
*  our state get the care that they need. And yes, we're seeing these agencies being stripped bare [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=325.12s)]
*  in search of waste, fraud, and abuse. Well, I think a Qatari jet that you want to somehow [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=332.64s)]
*  turn into Air Force One, think of that old television program, Pimp My Ride, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=342.0s)]
*  I think that's what waste, fraud, and abuse looks like. Meanwhile, ordinary people are [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=349.52s)]
*  just trying to make their lives work as the same Republican Congress wants to cut $800 billion [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=355.44s)]
*  out of Medicaid, $300 billion out of SNAP, literally taking health care and food out of the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=361.92s)]
*  mouths of hungry children in order to take care of his billionaire friends. That's the agenda. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=370.24s)]
*  And sadly, too many of my colleagues right here in the Senate and in the Congress are aiding and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=375.12s)]
*  abetting that agenda. And many of them, like me, are in somebody's church on Sunday morning. I [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=382.72s)]
*  continue to pastor my church. And I often say I'm a Matthew 25 Christian, where Jesus said, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  I was hungry, and you fed me. I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink. He also says, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=395.92s)]
*  I was hungry, and you didn't feed me. I was thirsty, and you didn't give me anything to drink. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=402.8s)]
*  And somebody said, Master, when did that happen to you? He said, well, in as much as you've done it [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=406.64s)]
*  until the least of these, you've done it also unto me. We must center the people and center [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=410.8s)]
*  their needs. And when we do that, we have a shot at getting the public policy right. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=417.04s)]
*  And I guess if we were to bring that into 2025 under the Trump administration, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=422.48s)]
*  while I was in need, you were out there asking for gold-plated Qatari jets. And not only is it [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  waste, fraud, and abuse, and violations of the emolument clause Congress hasn't approved of this. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=434.32s)]
*  By the way, we learned that moments ago, the Pentagon announced that it has officially [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=441.44s)]
*  accepted the jet. It's now in American custody from Qatar that will be used by Donald Trump [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=446.56s)]
*  once his ride gets pimped out while Americans are suffering. But there's a real issue here, too, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=453.04s)]
*  with our international standing and just how this makes us look. I mean, you had President [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=459.04s)]
*  Ramaphosa, the South African president, in the Oval Office. And he's sitting there with Donald [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=464.88s)]
*  Trump, and he has to say to Donald Trump, he's like, I'm sorry, I don't have the plane to give you, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=471.28000000000003s)]
*  but there are some issues that we need to discuss. And I'm sitting there, and I'm thinking, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=478.16s)]
*  this is just embarrassing. It's like embarrassing to our country. Let me show you that clip and get [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=482.64s)]
*  your reaction to it. That idiot talks about after viewing a thing where thousands of people are dead. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm sorry, I don't have a plane to give you. I wish I did. I would take it. If your country [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=493.2s)]
*  offered the United States Air Force a plane, I would take it. Okay. What's your response to that? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=499.68s)]
*  It's shameful. And as an American, it's embarrassing. We're seeing in real time, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=507.44s)]
*  what's at stake. This is not about him. This is about us. This is about our country, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=514.72s)]
*  where you literally have in real time the leader of another nation state, in this case, South Africa, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=520.16s)]
*  there to talk to him about trade. And he's saying, sorry, Mr. President, we don't have a plane [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=527.2s)]
*  to offer you. And you see why we have an emoluments clause in the first place. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=535.3599999999999s)]
*  This is a matter of national security. This is a matter of the credibility of the United States [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=543.52s)]
*  on the world stage. And this is a dark and dismal moment for our country. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=551.1199999999999s)]
*  Do you see any reason for hope though, Senator? It is a dark and dismal moment. And every day, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=558.4s)]
*  Americans feel like they're getting gut punched. Wake up. We read some horrible story of Trump [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=564.4s)]
*  doing this or Trump doing that, or even just his behavior. I mean, while all the suffrages going [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=570.64s)]
*  on, he's posting AI videos of himself hitting golf balls into Bruce Springsteen. And it's just like, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  for me, I watch it. And I really don't give a crap if he's posting things like that. But it's in the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=582.96s)]
*  context of all the other bad stuff that he's doing. And it just makes me want to puke. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=588.24s)]
*  It's a physical feeling. And I know a lot of Americans are actually now feeling physical pain [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=596.8000000000001s)]
*  by what he's inflicting, far worse than what I've just described. So I'll be clear about that. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=603.76s)]
*  So what's your message finally, before we wrap up to the American people right now? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=608.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. In addition to the horrible policy, in addition to the cuts of Medicaid, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=612.96s)]
*  the cuts of SNAP, in addition to the attacks on farmers and on our economy with these tariffs [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=618.72s)]
*  that really are attacks on everything for ordinary people, here's the other work that they're doing. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=625.6s)]
*  In addition to enriching themselves and enriching his friends, this is the work they're focused on. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=630.96s)]
*  They are trying to weaponize despair. They're trying to convince us that in this flooding of [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=638.32s)]
*  the zone, they've already won the fight. And I can tell you that as an heir to the civil rights [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=645.0400000000001s)]
*  movement, as pastor of the very church where Martin Luther King Jr. served, as someone who had the [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=651.84s)]
*  humble privileges serving as John Lewis's pastor, I'm not about to buy that lie anymore than I buy [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=658.5600000000001s)]
*  any of the other lies that they sell. We are not without hope. And my party may be out of power, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=665.12s)]
*  but we are not without power. And every single day I intend to use my power, use my voice [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=671.6s)]
*  to raise these issues. And I want to encourage every one of your viewers to do the same. Don't [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=678.32s)]
*  give in to those who are trying to weaponize despair. Don't give in to those who are trying [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=683.12s)]
*  to rob you of hope and thus the willingness to stand up and fight. I was John Lewis's pastor. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=688.5600000000001s)]
*  He had no reason to believe that when he was crossing that bridge, that he was going to be [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZufQ0Jm1Q&t=694.7199999999999s)]
