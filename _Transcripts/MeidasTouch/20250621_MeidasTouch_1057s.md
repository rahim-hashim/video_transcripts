*  props in the background when he held that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=51.14s)]
*  bizarre press conference a few days ago where he was talking about [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=54.660000000000004s)]
*  going to war with Iran and how it seemed like it was gonna be imminent and we got to kill the Ayatollah and then he [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=59.3s)]
*  ended up saying no I need two weeks two weeks later two weeks later, but some of the Juventus players [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=65.74s)]
*  they're saying we really didn't want to be there FIFA forced us to be there as part of the promotion of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=71.9s)]

*  with Tulsi Gabbard [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=101.58000000000001s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard is the director of national intelligence [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=103.86s)]
*  She should be the person with the foremost information [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=107.58s)]
*  regarding things like the nuclear capabilities of Iran [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=111.94s)]
*  But because she recently testified before Congress under oath that Iran was not capable of making nuclear weapons [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=115.46000000000001s)]

*  Building nuclear weapons. He was just like I don't trust her. She's wrong. She doesn't know what she's talking about, dude [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=139.98s)]
*  You picked her dude. She's the head of national intelligence. She's your D&I [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  Play this clip. What intelligence do you have that Iran is building a nuclear weapon your intelligence community has said they have no evidence [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=150.98s)]
*  That they are at this point [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=157.22s)]

*  Cost of a pound of ground beef is climbing towards six dollars over the past few years [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=303.3s)]
*  The average price was five dollars and ninety eight in May the highest ever [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=308.88s)]
*  So the price of ground beef continues to go up also because of the instability in the Middle East gas prices are gonna go back [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=312.54s)]

*  Meanwhile the government of India says that you had nothing to do at all with any zero [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=737.16s)]

*  Let's play this clip. I think the deal I'm most proud of is the fact that we're dealing with India [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=774.0s)]
*  We're dealing with Pakistan and we were able to stop potentially a nuclear war through trade as opposed through bullets [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=778.72s)]
*  You know, normally they do it through bullets. We do it through trade. So [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=785.76s)]
*  I'm very proud of that but I'm in three more DNA prime minister Modi [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=790.0s)]
*  Clearly told President Trump that during this entire episode [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=795.08s)]
*  There was never any discussion at any level about an India-us trade deal or US [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=800.32s)]
*  mediation between India and [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=808.72s)]

*  Prime Minister Modi [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=825.16s)]
*  family stated that India has neither accepted mediation nor does it do so and [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=827.3199999999999s)]
*  Never will do [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=834.92s)]
*  There is complete political unanimity on this subject in India [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=837.28s)]
*  President Trump [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=842.8s)]
*  understood the details [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=844.4s)]

*  Terrorism not as a proxy war but as a war meanwhile Donald Trump has his [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=858.12s)]
*  Gestapo across America dressed in their face masks and chasing down [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=865.2s)]

*  vendors [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=874.32s)]
*  Serving food in front of Home Depot's and they're going in factories and restaurants and hiding out outside of courtrooms [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=875.72s)]
*  Just take a look at [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=882.64s)]
*  What what it looks like on the streets of Mexico right now? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=885.0s)]
*  And by the way, these are the people who are apparently going to be at the World Cup who are going to be at [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=888.5600000000001s)]

*  Olympics they're gonna be waiting there. I guess snatching foreign visitors who show up [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=896.12s)]
*  I guess that [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=902.28s)]
*  One of the things too, we know inflation is rising we know [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=904.12s)]
*  Unemployment is rising. We know there's a GDP contraction taking place [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=908.88s)]
*  American consumers by the way believe inflation is gonna rise to seven point three percent [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=914.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna get that high but the Fed believes it's gonna hit three percent [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=918.96s)]
*  I think it'll be more like four and a half five percent [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=923.0600000000001s)]

*  One of the things that they're worried about right now is that the economic data we're even getting about inflation is [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=930.32s)]
*  Inaccurate because it's coming from the Trump regime. They've fired most of their data analysts who aggregate this data [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=937.56s)]
*  Do you believe the Trump regime is giving you accurate data on the economy? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=945.84s)]
*  And so almost a third of the prices now going into the CPI at the moment [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=950.48s)]
*  The consumer price index are just guesses that are being made and how do you think the regime is guessing? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=957.08s)]
*  How do you think we're getting this data? That's very problematic [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=963.32s)]
*  You go I always say trust yourself [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=967.6800000000001s)]
*  You go into the grocery store you go into department stores [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=971.72s)]

*  No, it's not when Trump says everything is cheaper and I look at the prices I go [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=982.0s)]
*  It's actually more expensive when Trump says there's a manufacturing boom when factories are being shut down and people are cutting jobs [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRGyKYI5cU8&t=986.8399999999999s)]
