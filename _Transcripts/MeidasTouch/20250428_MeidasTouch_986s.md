# FURIOUS Kenya BLASTS Trump in PUBLIC MEETING
**MeidasTouch:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I)
*  All throughout Africa and East Africa is no exception. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=0.0s)]
*  The countries on the continent are pissed at Donald Trump. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=5.12s)]
*  They believe that Trump is blowing up the world order, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=10.0s)]
*  and all of the goodwill that former President Biden helped establish in various African nations. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=14.64s)]
*  Donald Trump has wiped out instantly, and you know who has prounced on that? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=22.0s)]
*  Xi Jinping of China. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=28.4s)]
*  Should be noted that Africa is one of the fastest growing digital continents in the United States, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=30.96s)]
*  probably the fastest growing digital continent. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=38.64s)]
*  A lot of big business growing there, and it's important that we invest in Africa. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=42.16s)]
*  If you take a look in East Africa, for example, in the Republic of Kenya, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  which now has the largest economy in East Africa, about 131.67 billion. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  About four or five times the GDP of El Salvador, which Donald Trump loves so much. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=58.32s)]
*  There, the Kenyan President William Ruto basically said that Trump has just created a death blow [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=64.72s)]
*  to the current world order. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=74.16s)]
*  A death blow, he said. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=76.08s)]
*  And then shortly after making those remarks as Donald Trump tariffed the world, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=78.08s)]
*  President Ruto of the Republic of Kenya took a state visit to China to meet with Xi Jinping. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=83.52s)]
*  So as Donald Trump has been lying this whole week, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=92.32s)]
*  and faking having conversations with Xi Jinping, further humiliating the United States, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=95.36s)]
*  we know what Xi Jinping was doing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=101.84s)]
*  He was giving a state welcome, a big celebratory visit to the leader of Kenya, President Ruto. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=104.32s)]
*  It should be noted how strategically smart former President Biden was right here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=114.0s)]
*  Who was the ambassador to the Republic of Kenya under former President Biden's administration? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=120.16s)]
*  It was Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay and HP. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=126.48s)]
*  It was a very strong and powerful showing by former President Biden that he was committed [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=133.12s)]
*  not just to the Republic of Kenya, but also to the entire continent in Africa, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=139.76s)]
*  and that it was an important priority for him to invest in Africa. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  Now we know that China has sought this foothold in Africa through their belt and road, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=151.2s)]
*  or their bridge and road initiatives. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=157.92s)]
*  The New Silk Road, where they've spent billions in different African nations. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  They've helped build government buildings. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=165.2s)]
*  They've helped build highways there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  They understand the strategic importance of Africa to China, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=169.84s)]
*  and building goodwill and what that could ultimately do. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  They have strong power, they have soft power. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=178.72s)]
*  A lot of what the United States was doing also with USAID, which Trump and Elon Musk gutted, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=181.36s)]
*  was kind of similar in trying to help out African nations and show solidarity with countries. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=188.56s)]
*  So let me show you what went down. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=197.52s)]
*  As I mentioned, President William Ruto of Kenya, after saying that Trump issued a death blow [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=200.0s)]
*  to the World Outorder, he meets with Xi Jinping. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=207.28s)]
*  He goes to China, he's in Beijing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=210.72s)]
*  He thanks Xi Jinping for the tens of millions of dollars in support for health, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  education, and disaster relief, as well as for the planned construction of a new complex [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  for Kenya's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=226.0s)]
*  And by the way, take a look at Ruto's background. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=229.84s)]
*  You would think that he would be someone who Donald Trump would try to cultivate, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=232.32s)]
*  an evangelical Christian from a modest background, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=235.68s)]
*  who was elected on promises to help Kenya's poor in a country that was struggling with debt. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=239.6s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=246.8s)]
*  You've seen my reporting from this past week. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=248.32s)]
*  Donald Trump has denied emergency aid to red states like Arkansas, to Kentucky, to Georgia, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  for like debris removal, things caused by flooding, tornadoes, hurricane, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=261.04s)]
*  Helene, North Carolina, Donald Trump stopped emergency relief. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=265.68s)]
*  China is giving emergency disaster relief to Kenya, not just Kenya, across the world. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=270.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=276.64s)]
*  They also want Kenya to join the BRICS block. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=277.2s)]
*  And China is making their play right now. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  And they also uniquely understand that Africa in general is the fastest growing digital continent. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=283.52s)]
*  And in under 100 days, Trump has just totally destroyed America's presence there. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=295.36s)]
*  Let me show you what went down when you had President Ruto of Kenya show up at the state [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=302.4s)]
*  visit in China this past week. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=308.88s)]
*  Let me just show you what it looks like. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=310.4s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=311.67999999999995s)]
*  Here's how France 24 correspondent talks about it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=312.64s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=332.72s)]
*  On Tuesday, Kenya's President William Ruto arrived in Beijing for talks aimed at increasing [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=334.24s)]
*  investment and trade. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=340.24s)]
*  China is already Kenya's biggest lender. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=342.16s)]
*  They funded massive road, railway and power projects. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=344.56s)]
*  Ruto is hoping to expand that partnership, especially in the manufacturing [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=348.64s)]
*  and digital infrastructure sectors. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=353.12s)]
*  So in contrast, let me just share with you how Donald Trump just talks about Africa [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=355.92s)]
*  in general, how he just overgeneralizes Africa and how he makes just the discussions of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=362.4s)]
*  African nations like into a joke. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=371.68s)]
*  So I just showed you that this was Donald Trump from the joint address he gave to Congress. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=381.52s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump said about Congo in the Oval Office over the past few weeks. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=392.32s)]
*  But I'll just show you this one clip, but he says this over and over again. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=401.84s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=404.64s)]
*  And then Donald Trump posted this on Friday. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=416.88s)]
*  Big news coming out of Africa, where I am also involved in settling violent wars and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=420.4s)]
*  conflicts. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=428.0s)]
*  I don't know why so many of these events have fallen to me and my administration, but they [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=429.2s)]
*  have. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=435.44s)]
*  And we have done an unprecedented job in getting them settled or putting them in a position [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=436.08s)]
*  for peace. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  Stay tuned! [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=441.84s)]
*  Exclamation point as our editor-in-chief Ron Volopkowski writes, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=442.79999999999995s)]
*  While on his trip to Italy for the Pope's funeral, Trump says he is ending violent wars [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  and conflicts in Africa. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=453.28s)]
*  And again, Donald Trump has no understanding for cultural differences within Africa, what [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=456.23999999999995s)]
*  nations are in Africa. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=463.12s)]
*  And I'll show you this as well. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=466.32s)]
*  As Donald Trump continues to demean African nations, Donald Trump has said horrible things [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=468.48s)]
*  about South Africa. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=475.92s)]
*  He and Elon Musk have just said the worst things about the government there, imaginable [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=477.52s)]
*  executive orders about South Africa. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=485.68s)]
*  The European Union Commission and European Union leaders have stepped up and they also [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=489.52s)]
*  see US weakness under Trump. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=497.12s)]
*  And so they've talked about, we like diversity, we're for you, we're with you. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=499.36s)]
*  Watch what they put together in the European Union Commission and European leaders. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=503.92s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=508.4s)]
*  We love our constitutional rights and protections and we do believe in a non-racial, non-sexist [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=527.2s)]

*  Like you, we put you the values of solidarity, equality and sustainability. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=538.72s)]

*  in Beijing, President Ruto. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=676.96s)]
*  This is former President Biden. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=679.52s)]
*  He posted on May 26, 2024, not all that long ago, what? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=682.32s)]
*  A year ago, a little more than a year ago. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=688.16s)]
*  America and Kenya, divided by distance, united by democratic values. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=691.2s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=698.8000000000001s)]
*  And here's the video he posted. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=699.6s)]
*  President Ruto, Mrs. Ruto, it's an honor to welcome you to the White House to celebrate [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=701.2s)]
*  60 years of partnership between Kenya and the United States. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=705.9200000000001s)]
*  At the stroke of midnight on December 12, 1963, the world changed. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=709.2s)]
*  Many Americans and many people around the world watched with great hope as hundreds [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=714.4000000000001s)]
*  of thousands of Kenyans came together, raised a new flag, declared their freedom, and gave [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=718.72s)]
*  life to a new nation. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=724.4s)]
*  It was a moment that forever connected our two nations. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=726.08s)]
*  Together, the United States and Kenya are working to deliver on the challenges that [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  matter most to our people's lives. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=733.2s)]
*  Health security, economic security, cyber security, and climate security. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=735.44s)]
*  Across the region, Kenya and America are driving a race to the top with investments that we have [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  and high standards for workers, technology, and environment. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=746.16s)]
*  The past is our proof that we are stronger and the world is safer when Kenya and the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=750.3199999999999s)]
*  United States work together. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=756.0s)]
*  And then from that state visit that former President Biden gave to President Ruto, he [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=759.68s)]
*  said, today I am optimistic and hopeful as I was all those years ago when Kenyan patriots [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=766.9599999999999s)]
*  raised a new flag high into the midnight sky. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=773.68s)]
*  Kenya and the United States stand together, committed to each other, committed to our [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=776.9599999999999s)]
*  people, and committed to building a better world. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=782.16s)]
*  Meg Whitman, what an incredible ambassador to have in Kenya, given her background and [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=786.3199999999999s)]
*  why is she a perfect fit? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=792.16s)]
*  Because in Kenya, entrepreneurial spirit, building business. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=793.68s)]
*  I know Donald Trump thinks Africa's all war and conflict, but entrepreneurial spirit, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=797.68s)]
*  digital expanding economy, growth, semiconductor chips, AI. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=803.4399999999999s)]
*  There's a lot to do there and a lot that China's trying to do. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=809.52s)]
*  So former President Biden's playing the geopolitical game and having an entrepreneur [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=815.04s)]
*  like Meg Whitman, like an all-star. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=820.16s)]
*  She explains how she was picked to be the ambassador. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=822.72s)]
*  She goes, Joe Biden called me and said, hey, Meg, I want you to be an ambassador. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=826.0s)]
*  And before I can say anything, he said, I want you to go to Kenya. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=830.72s)]
*  I said, Kenya? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=834.5600000000001s)]
*  I was thinking France. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=835.84s)]
*  But she then goes on to talk about why it was so important. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=838.1600000000001s)]
*  Here's just a small portion of Meg Whitman's honorable Margaret Whitman. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=842.4s)]
*  She goes by Meg. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=848.8000000000001s)]
*  Her quick interview that she gave recently at the Princeton School of Public International [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=850.8000000000001s)]
*  Affairs. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=857.9200000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=858.4s)]
*  So I became convinced that the number one thing I could add value as non-career diplomat [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=858.96s)]
*  is jobs, jobs, jobs, and attracting foreign direct investment and helping to shape the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=865.6800000000001s)]
*  economic investment climate so Kenyan firms could grow and thrive. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=871.52s)]
*  So we work together on what changes from a legal and regulatory standpoint would help [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=875.9200000000001s)]
*  country companies. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=881.2s)]
*  And then how do you change the narrative on Africa and Kenya? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=882.48s)]
*  I know that when I was at HP and eBay, I thought about Africa 1% of the time. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=886.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=892.48s)]
*  But I got things going on in Europe and Latin America and Asia. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=894.0s)]
*  And Africa is a really long way away. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=897.76s)]
*  And I think the narrative among most business people in America is 30 or 40 years old. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=899.84s)]
*  They don't understand the economic situation. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=906.48s)]
*  They don't understand the demographics and they don't understand the potential of many [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=909.2800000000001s)]
*  of the countries in Africa. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=913.44s)]
*  So the very first thing we had to do was to start off by changing the narrative and then [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=914.8s)]
*  changing the regulatory environment to make foreign direct investment and, frankly, the [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=919.76s)]
*  Kenyan dynamic economy more able to succeed. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=925.8399999999999s)]
*  I think it's so important that the news cover this stuff. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=930.4799999999999s)]

*  America and elsewhere. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=944.08s)]
*  I think it's so important that we cover what's going on in Africa, East Africa, Kenya. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=946.0s)]
*  When we talk about the geopolitical ramifications of Donald Trump's destruction of America's [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBpvYNgj1I&t=952.08s)]
