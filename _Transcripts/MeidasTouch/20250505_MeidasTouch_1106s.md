# Trump Interview GETS DELETED at KEY MOMENTS in Broadcast
**MeidasTouch:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY)
*  I just want to make sure I have this correct. Donald Trump is suing CBS and 60 minutes for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=0.0s)]
*  20 billion dollars because he's claiming that back in October of 2024 they aired an interview [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=6.0s)]
*  of former vice president Kamala Harris that had some edits in it, although the full interview [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=14.56s)]
*  was separately accessible. But then Donald Trump's interviews are always frequently heavily [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=21.04s)]
*  edited by Fox. And then when Donald Trump just did an interview this weekend with Kristen Welker [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=29.6s)]
*  of Meet the Press on NBC, massive portions of the interview were deleted and edited out from what [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=36.56s)]
*  ultimately aired to the public. If you went on the NBC website, which our editorial team did, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=44.56s)]
*  they did post the full interview there. And some of the most damaging clips of Donald Trump were [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  not aired publicly. So I want to get this straight. Can I become a billionaire now? Because [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=57.76s)]
*  Donald Trump sued CBS for 20 billion dollars, claiming that his injury, and by the way, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=64.72s)]
*  Ronny Jackson, MAGA Republican Congress member from Amarillo, Texas, was added to the lawsuit so [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=72.08s)]
*  Donald Trump could forum shop to have the case heard in the Northern District of Texas before [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=78.72s)]
*  a judge that Donald Trump likes. They're alleging that they are consumers who were injured because [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=83.92s)]
*  it hurt their eyes as consumers to take in what they said was an edited interview of former vice [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  president Kamala Harris. They said 20 billion dollars is the damage. Okay, so folks, 20 billion [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=97.84s)]
*  dollars, maybe I'll buy us all yachts and jets or whatever the oligarchs get because I think I've [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  been injured 20 billion dollars. What do you think? Well, we've got the footage here at the Midas [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=112.32s)]
*  Touch Network. Shall we look at what NBC deleted on Meet the Press? It was on their website, but it [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=117.6s)]
*  was not shown publicly on Meet the Press. Let's take a look. Shall we? We did a whole report on [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  this on MidasPlus.com. Subscribe to our substack and on MidasNews.com as well. What did they take [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=131.84s)]
*  out? Maybe a reference to Jeff Bezos and how Donald Trump basically shook down Bezos. Bezos [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=140.4s)]
*  and Amazon were going to include the additional price of the goods being sold on Amazon [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  that are now caused by the tariffs. There was going to be a tariff line item. Why your products cost [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  more money? But Donald Trump, who says that the foreign countries eat the tariffs, he goes, they [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=163.6s)]
*  eat it. They eat the tariffs. Okay, well, if they're eating the tariffs, then why are you worried about [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=170.16s)]
*  Jeff Bezos and Amazon putting tariffs on the receipt of the consumer? Well, anyway, this clip [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=176.64s)]
*  got edited out by NBC. I wonder why they edited this one out here. Play this clip. What did you [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  say to Jeff Bezos? He's just a very nice guy. We have a relationship. I asked him about it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=191.12s)]
*  He said, well, I don't want to do that. And he took it off immediately. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=197.6s)]
*  So he changed course. And will you take that same tactic with other CEOs? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  I'll always call people if I disagree with them. If I think that somebody's doing something that's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=205.44s)]
*  incorrect, wrong, or maybe hurtful to the country, I'll call. Absolutely. Wouldn't you want me to call? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=211.6s)]
*  Biden wouldn't call because he didn't know what was happening, but I do. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=216.4s)]
*  They edited that clip out. $20 billion. Please let me take your $20 billion. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=220.16s)]
*  Okay, folks, how many yachts should I buy with that? How many jets should I buy with that? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=226.72s)]
*  Okay, the next clip NBC did not include on the broadcast to the public was when Donald Trump [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=233.76s)]
*  said that egg prices are down 87%. Then Kristen Welker, the host, tries to help Donald Trump and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=240.56s)]
*  goes, look, Donald, we know that eggs were high because of, she tries to give him the answer. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=249.52s)]
*  Bird flu. That's why. Blame it on bird flu. Even though former president Biden never got the benefit [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=255.28s)]
*  of the doubt on anything. And Kristen Welker and others would just destroy Biden on literally every [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=260.64s)]
*  issue. And by the way, when's the NBC story going to run on how cognitively declined [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=266.24s)]
*  Donald Trump looks? If you have people in your life that you know who have dementia or suffer [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=272.48s)]
*  from cognitive issues, I'm not a doctor. I don't know what I'm observing with Donald Trump, but I [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=277.52s)]
*  can tell you that it certainly looks like people I know that do. So you tell me. But anyway, she [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=281.76s)]
*  tries to help him and goes, it was because of the bird flu. Now, Donald Trump, whatever it is, he [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=287.12s)]
*  doesn't even understand she's trying to help him. So he attacks her and he goes, why would you say [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=292.32s)]
*  that? Why would you say that? We had the same bird flu as he had. She's trying to help him there. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=296.64s)]
*  I wonder if that's why they cut this clip out from what was aired to the public. You play this clip. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=303.2s)]
*  People, it didn't matter what they made because they were losing their shirt because of costs. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=308.4s)]
*  Now take a look at what happened. Oil is down. Gasoline is down. Groceries are down. Eggs. You [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=313.68s)]
*  were the one that asked me. You asked me about eggs. It was the first week. I didn't even know [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=319.76s)]
*  anything about what were you talking about? Egg prices were so high, you couldn't buy eggs. They [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  didn't have any eggs. And they said Easter is going to be a disaster. Well, we had Easter at [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=329.12s)]
*  the White House and we had thousands of eggs and they were down 87%. Yeah. A lot of that, of course, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  spike was because of bird flu. But when does it become the Trump economy? Why do you say that? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=340.32s)]
*  We had the same bird flu as he had. The next clip that they edited out on the NBC interview [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=346.0s)]
*  that the public didn't get to see, unless you went to the NBC website, not a lot of people [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=351.76000000000005s)]
*  do that, is when Donald Trump whines about the 2020 election. For a long time in this interview, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=357.6s)]
*  that all got cut. Donald Trump was saying the election was rigged and Kristen Welker again [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=364.8s)]
*  tries to help him. And she goes, I don't want to look back. Let's look forward. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=370.08000000000004s)]
*  Donald, I want to look back. It was rigged. It was unfair. All right, Donald, let's move on. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=374.48s)]
*  It was right. I wonder why they deleted this clip here. Play it. You know, my four years were [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=378.8s)]
*  phenomenal. As you know, the stock market, in fact, even though we had to go through the COVID [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=383.92s)]
*  thing, that horrible situation with COVID, we did numbers. And when I gave it over, when I handed it [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=389.44s)]
*  over, the election was rigged and I handed it. And because of that, we have a lot of problems, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=396.48s)]
*  by the way. But when I handed it over, what happened? The market was higher than it was [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=400.0s)]
*  previous to just previous to COVID coming in. Nobody could believe it. The stock market I'm [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=405.2s)]
*  talking about. I don't want to look back, but you did take your case to court about that. You took [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=410.08s)]
*  your case to court about your allegations against the election. Let me ask you. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=416.24s)]
*  There's no question about the election was rigged. The facts are in and it's still being [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=422.08s)]
*  litigated. Let's go. You did take your case to court more than 60 times and didn't win those [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=427.12s)]
*  cases. Just to button that up, though, sir. Just to button that up. How worried are you? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=431.2s)]
*  Are we talking about the election of 2020? Let's talk about here and now. Let's talk about the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=437.36s)]
*  election of 2020. Let's not talk about it. Let's talk about here and now. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=440.24s)]
*  I think you get the point now of which clips they're deleting. And again, as a consumer, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=443.52s)]
*  Donald Trump says he's a consumer and Ronnie Jackson. So Ronnie Jackson's a consumer and they [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=449.2s)]
*  suffered serious emotional distress. That's why they're suing CBS for 20 billion in Paramount. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=455.04s)]
*  I don't know. Are you distressed? I'm distressed. 20 billion. 20 billion seems about right. Thanks [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=463.20000000000005s)]
*  for creating that precedent for me, Donald. And then over here, Donald Trump, this is where he [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=468.0s)]
*  goes. What people don't understand is that the countries eat the tariffs. They eat the tariffs. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=473.92s)]
*  They're eating the dogs. They're eating the cats. They're eating the tariffs. Apparently here play [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=480.88s)]
*  this clip. But what people don't understand is, and this is a lot, the country eats the tariff. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=485.44s)]
*  The company eats the tariff and it's not passed along at all. Well, some are saying they're going [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=492.0s)]
*  to have to pass it on. So how do you deal with those CEOs? How do you deal with those? China is [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=498.24s)]
*  eating the tariffs. What do you say to those CEOs who were saying we might have to pass this on to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=502.8s)]
*  the consumers? Well, they say that because maybe it's to their advantage to say it. Maybe they'll [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=507.28s)]
*  punish them. No, because you know what? I want them to build plants in the United States. That way [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=510.96s)]
*  they don't have any tariffs. See, tariffs will and not only will look at what's happened in two months. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=516.0799999999999s)]
*  We're close to nine trillion dollars of investment. We've never been anywhere near that. Okay. Well, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=522.64s)]
*  if you want to know my opinion, why NBC edited that out, because if you take that clip with the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=528.4s)]
*  Bezos clip, it shows that Donald Trump is the most generous thing you can say about Donald Trump, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=534.88s)]
*  is that either he's an idiot, he has major cognitive issues. That's the nicest interpretation of him, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=543.52s)]
*  honestly, right? Because the alternative is that this is just an insane monster, which is probably [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=551.36s)]
*  all of the above right here. So the countries are eating it. Okay. But Bezos is putting it on [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=559.36s)]
*  because the countries are eating it. And then you're calling Bezos to say hide the tariffs. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=567.28s)]
*  Doesn't this seem a little bit like like a miracle? It's all going to go away. Stop the testing. Stop [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=572.64s)]
*  the testing. I've given this example before, and it just bears repeating right now. I saw that movie [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=577.84s)]
*  was with Leonardo DiCaprio and others called Don't Look Up. The asteroid is about to hit the earth [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=585.2s)]
*  and people see it coming. They see it coming. And then there's a whole movement of just don't look [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=592.5600000000001s)]
*  up. Don't look up, which to me is like a miracle. It's all going to go away. Don't look at the ports. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=598.08s)]
*  Don't see that shipping has come to a complete halt in Seattle, in Long Beach, in Boston. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=603.44s)]
*  Don't look up. Don't see that the ships are all in Shanghai and in Chinese ports and they're not [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=610.08s)]
*  coming here. Don't look up. Don't see that this is having a disastrous impact systemically on our [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=616.24s)]
*  economy. And we know what the next several quarters are going to look like if we go down this path. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=623.28s)]
*  Don't look up. I want to tell you to look up. See it. Let's look at it. Let's try to solve it. Let's [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=628.72s)]
*  try to fix it. The parallels there are uncanny. It almost feels like the current moment is a parody [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=636.32s)]

*  consumer who suffered $20 billion of damages, him and Ronnie Jackson for what they observed [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=727.9200000000001s)]
*  with, they said, the former vice president Kamala Harris interview being edited. By the way, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=735.2800000000001s)]
*  they like took out, and CBS took out like some ums or ahs when it was, look, it was probably like [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=741.12s)]
*  45 seconds where Kamala Harris, she wasn't bad, she was just like a little bit non-responsive [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=747.44s)]
*  to the question and it just slowed down the answer. So they put it on the full one and they like [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=753.84s)]
*  removed it. There was nothing substantive that drastically or that even materially changed [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=758.32s)]
*  any of the answers. Here, just take a look at the lawsuit. This is the amended complaint filed [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=764.0s)]
*  February 7th, 2025. And then this is how it's written, in plain English, freedom carries with [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=768.32s)]
*  it responsibility even for the press. Freedom of the press is not freedom from responsibility [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=774.72s)]
*  for its exercise. Then it says, Paramount and CBS disagree. They believe in unbounded freedom to [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=780.48s)]
*  harm media content competitors, including President Trump by misrepresenting the nature, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=788.0s)]
*  characteristics, and qualities of their broadcasts and digital services deceive consumers, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=794.1600000000001s)]
*  including plaintiffs, Donald Trump and Ronnie Jackson, through advertisement and commercial [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=800.72s)]
*  promotion of substantially distorted broadcast and digital media content masquerading as news. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=806.64s)]
*  C. Freely disseminate such substantially distorted broadcast and digital media content [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=814.72s)]
*  to the detriment of competitors and consumers. D. Brand their distorted broadcast and digital [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=821.36s)]
*  media content as legitimately edited news, all for profit without any level of responsibility, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=827.2s)]
*  commensurate with their influence over the American public. That's what this lawsuit is about. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=834.24s)]
*  Then it says in October, 2024, one month before Trump's landslide victory, it wasn't a landslide, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=839.5200000000001s)]
*  defendants consistent with their modus operandi of advertising and disseminating false election [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=845.9200000000001s)]
*  related content for commercial benefit, advertised and promoted their CBS News 60 Minutes Election [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=852.24s)]
*  Special Show, which was to air in prime time on Monday, October 7, 2024, and feature interviews [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=859.36s)]
*  with then candidate Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Walz. By the way, Trump was too [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=866.5600000000001s)]
*  chicken shit, excuse my language, to even do the interview. Trump refused to interview at 60 Minutes [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=872.24s)]
*  because he was too afraid. Remember the 2020 60 Minutes interview with Leslie Stahl where Donald [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=878.32s)]
*  Trump brought a fake binder with blank pages and claimed it was his healthcare plan, and then she [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=884.72s)]
*  asked to take a look at it and it was all blank pages and Donald Trump just walked off and said, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=890.88s)]
*  you're just being nasty to me. He was too scared to do it. Kamala Harris did the interview. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=895.7600000000001s)]
*  Then you go through it and you're trying to take a look like, what the hell is this lawsuit even [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=901.6800000000001s)]
*  about? It randomly has photos of Trump's art of the deal. Then it goes, as an initial matter, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=906.24s)]
*  the unedited transcript revealed that the advertised Harris reply and the manipulated Harris reply [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=912.4s)]
*  were both part of a single answer mangled beyond recognition by defendants tampering. I just want [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=920.16s)]
*  to show you what the whole lawsuit is based on. I'm reading Trump's lawsuit. The bold portion aired [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=927.84s)]
*  on Face the Nation on October 6, 2024. The underlined portion aired during election special [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=934.0s)]
*  on October 7, 2024. The remainder is unused. This is what the lawsuit is about. Everything is in [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=940.8s)]
*  this paragraph and Trump says that if you were to see this entire paragraph, that would have changed [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=947.92s)]
*  what? You won the election. Whitaker from 60 Minutes. We supply Israel with billions of [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=953.6s)]
*  dollars in military aid, and yet Prime Minister Netanyahu seems to be charting his own course. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=959.9200000000001s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration has pressed him to agree to a ceasefire. He's resisted. You urged [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=964.88s)]
*  him not to go into Lebanon. He went in anyway. Does the U.S. have no sway over Prime Minister [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=970.1600000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu Harris? The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=975.2800000000001s)]
*  pursuit around making clear our principles. Whitaker. But it seems that Prime Minister [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=982.08s)]
*  Netanyahu is not listening. Harris. Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=987.52s)]
*  number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by a result of many things, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=992.3199999999999s)]
*  including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. And we're not going to stop doing [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=997.52s)]
*  that. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=1002.4s)]
*  about where we stand on the need for this war to end. So what Donald Trump's saying is that entire [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=1008.48s)]
*  thing that I just read should have all been just like that. But because it was a little bit sliced [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=1015.52s)]
*  and diced and not all of that was in there, that's his injury. That's his damage. I'm reading you from [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=1020.8s)]
*  his lawsuit, page 63. That's the claim for 20 billion dollars in injury. So if you take that [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=1026.96s)]
*  and then you take a look at what I just said was edited by NBC, maybe it's one trillion. Maybe my [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=1033.28s)]
*  lawsuit should be for one trillion gazillion dollars. I mean, at this point, folks, there's [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=1038.8799999999999s)]
*  the Turkish proverb, and I've heard this in other cultures as well, which is when you bring the clown [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=1044.4s)]
*  into the palace, the palace doesn't make the clown a king. The palace becomes a circus. No offense to [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=1050.48s)]
*  clowns and circuses. Real professions and circuses can be enjoyable. Not in politics, though, and not [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV77J21UZSY&t=1056.96s)]
