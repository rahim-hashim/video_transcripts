# Trump CRUMBLES from AWFUL NEWSâ€¦PANIC POSTS!
**MeidasTouch:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE)
*  Donald Trump spent the day yesterday roaming his Virginia golf course wearing a hat that says [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=0.0s)]
*  Gulf of America and making demented post after demented post. Let me read for you what he was [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=6.08s)]
*  saying on Easter. Apparently Donald Trump got jealous that Easter was getting too much attention [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  and Donald Trump had to post the following. Since our announcement of Liberation Day, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=19.04s)]
*  and he puts that in caps, the sentence if it were to be truthful is the markets tanked, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=24.72s)]
*  the dollar tanked. America has been put in a position where it's heading into a recession [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=31.52s)]
*  or something worse. But what did Donald Trump say? He said the following, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=37.04s)]
*  many leaders and business executives have come to me asking for relief from tariffs. It's good to see [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=41.04s)]
*  that the world knows we are serious because we are! Yeah, Donald, I'm sure [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=47.92s)]
*  really serious people go around posting on social media in all caps how serious they are. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=53.68s)]
*  Donald Trump continues to post, they must right the wrongs of decades of abuse, but it won't be [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=60.32s)]
*  easy for them. We must rebuild the wealth of our great country and create true reciprocity. Yes, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=66.4s)]
*  Donald, reciprocity amongst the penguins, reciprocity amongst Madagascar and their chocolate, Donald. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=73.12s)]
*  What in the world are you even talking about? America was the richest nation in the world by [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=81.36s)]
*  far. Under former President Biden, we had the fastest growing GDP. We were producing the most [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=86.8s)]
*  oil here. We were energy independent. 16.2 million jobs were created. Record low unemployment, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  40,000 infrastructure projects. We were leading the world in green projects. We were taking the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=99.12s)]
*  advantage and the initiative away from China. But you blew it all up, Donald, with all of your [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=105.36s)]
*  demented behavior. He continues to post. But for those who want the easiest path, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=110.96s)]
*  come to America and build in America. Donald, if they come to America, what, you're going to send [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=116.08s)]
*  them to concentration camps in El Salvador? Come to America, what, where there's no habeas corpus [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  or due process anymore under your authoritarian regime? What, come to America where you and your [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=127.35999999999999s)]
*  regime extort our allies and treat allies worse than adversaries? Where you cuddle up to Vladimir [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=132.56s)]
*  Putin, where you roam your Virginia golf course on Easter wearing ridiculous hats that say Gulf [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=139.36s)]
*  of America? It's idiotic. Donald Trump then posts the following. Non-tariff cheating. One, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  currency manipulation. Two, value added taxes, which act as tariffs and export subsidies. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=152.08s)]
*  Three, dumping below cost. Four, expert subsidies and other government subsidies. Five, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  protective agriculture standards. Donald, we understand issues that affect global trade. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=163.44s)]
*  If you want to address it intelligibly, then perhaps that's what you should have done. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=172.0s)]
*  Instead of calling reciprocal tariffs what you did and then using a formula that uses [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=177.52s)]
*  deficits and then incorrectly uses that formula to attack every country in the world with a [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=184.88s)]
*  trade war where you're now getting utterly outmaneuvered by everyone, then Donald Trump [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=191.52s)]
*  posts this photo of Judge Boasberg in Washington, D.C., the federal judge who initiated contempt [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=196.88000000000002s)]
*  proceedings against the Trump regime. Trump posted a photo of Boasberg in this article [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  that says, judge who blocked Trump deportations took junket to event with anti-Trump whatever. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=209.68s)]
*  And I opened it up and I'm like, okay, what are they attacking Judge Boasberg for? And it says he [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=217.6s)]
*  attended a Ritzy Sun Valley event. And then it talks about who else attended the event. And they [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=222.48s)]
*  said three judges appointed by Donald Trump attended that event. So there were what? Seven or eight [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=228.72s)]
*  judges appointed by Democratic administrations, three judges appointed by Trump. And that's why [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=236.0s)]
*  you're posting photos of Judge Boasberg. Then Donald Trump posts this on Easter. Radical lunatic [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=241.12s)]
*  Democrats and their comrades in the fake news media are falsely making Kilmar Armando Abrego [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=246.64s)]
*  Garcia out to be a very sweet and innocent person, which is a total blatant and dangerous lie. Garcia [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  has been found by two separate courts to be a member of the violent killer gang MS-13, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=259.84s)]
*  was in our country illegally and is under deportation order. He was under a withholding order, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  Donald, in 2019, which says you can't send him to El Salvador. Also, when you look at the orders [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=270.96s)]
*  by those judges, it says no criminal history by the judge during your first administration in 2019. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=277.84s)]
*  Also, y'all gave him a work permit, Donald. You did. Your regime, your first administration, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=285.28s)]
*  gave him a work permit. So, oh, this massive leader of the MS-13 got a work permit where he [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  was permitted by your administration to check in once a year with ICE before he was deported [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=297.68s)]
*  somewhere other than El Salvador, which he was not to be deported. And he was able to work with his [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=303.52s)]
*  where he lived with his family. His wife's an American citizen. His kids, three kids, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=309.52s)]
*  are American citizens. And no one's vouching for Abrego Garcia as a human being. We're standing up [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=314.16s)]
*  for due process. If the evidence shows that Abrego Garcia is a bad guy who engaged in criminal [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=321.44s)]
*  conduct, then there can be consequences. And the consequences should be tailored to what the crimes [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=328.16s)]
*  are. Now, if he's going to get killed by going to El Salvador, he could be deported somewhere else. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=334.24s)]
*  In 2019, the immigration judge said, deport him if you want to deport him, just not to El Salvador. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=340.48s)]
*  You violated that. The Supreme Court, nine to zero, said facilitate the return. Oh, and by the way, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=345.92s)]
*  did everybody know this? On Sunday, Naib Bukele, the authoritarian leader of El Salvador, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=351.12s)]
*  sent a bizarre unhinged Trump-like message to the authoritarian leader of Venezuela, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=358.48s)]
*  Nicolas Maduro. And Naib Bukele said, we'll give you the 230 plus prisoners that the United States [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=365.92s)]
*  gave us in our concentration camps. But in exchange, we want you to release certain [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=375.04s)]
*  prisoners being held in the Venezuelan prison system. So great job, Donald. You now have Naib [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=380.32s)]
*  Bukele talking about facilitating the individuals who you gave no due process to, to the authoritarian [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=386.56s)]
*  leader of Venezuela as part of a prison exchange, which, by the way, the authoritarian leader of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=394.24s)]
*  Venezuela is not going to do. So you've just lowered the entire stature of the United States [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=399.76s)]
*  into a fight between El Salvador and Venezuela while China is eating your freaking lunch, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=406.0s)]
*  Donald. Then Donald Trump posts this all in caps. The businessmen who criticize tariffs are bad at [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=413.28s)]
*  business, but really bad at politics. They don't understand or realize that I am the greatest friend [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=419.6s)]
*  that American capitalism ever had. To which Carl Quintanilla, a reporter for the business network, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=426.48s)]
*  CNBC, posted the disclosure from Donald Trump's SEC statement in connection with Trump media, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=433.76s)]
*  Trump social media platform, which says the following entities associated with Donald Trump [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  have filed for bankruptcy protection in the past. This is from Trump's own file. And let me be clear [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=447.6s)]
*  the Trump Taj Mahal, which was built and owned by Donald Trump, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=452.8s)]
*  1991, the Trump Plaza, the Trump Castle, the Trump Plaza Hotel, all owned by Donald Trump at the time, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=457.68s)]
*  filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy also in 1992, THCR, which was founded by Donald Trump in 1995, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=463.28s)]
*  filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2004, Trump Entertainment Resorts, Inc., the new name given [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  to Trump hotels and casinos after its 2004 bankruptcy declared bankruptcy in 2009. By the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=476.23999999999995s)]
*  way, that list there doesn't include all of the products that Donald Trump lent his name to in [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=482.79999999999995s)]
*  licensing deals, which also crashed like Trump Stakes and Trump University and Trump Mortgage [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=487.76s)]
*  and all of the other Trump things that failed. By the way, as we start this week, the dollar is [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=494.0s)]
*  tanking, the dollar starting the week down against every major currency in the world, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=500.08s)]
*  with the exception of the Turkish lira. But Donald Trump continues to post away, hopefully Russia and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=504.8s)]
*  Ukraine. Well, this is all in caps, of course, all in caps on Easter while Donald Trump's golfing [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  with a hat that says Golf of America. Hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=515.92s)]
*  Both will then start to do big business with the United States of America, which is thriving and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=520.56s)]
*  make a fortune. You could get super rich. I mean, Russia, Ukraine, listen to my all caps posts. Do [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=526.24s)]
*  you both want to get rich? I will both sides this. I'm going to treat the country that did the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=532.8s)]
*  unlawful invasion much better than the country that was unlawfully invaded. And I'll just hand out, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=537.76s)]
*  y'all are going to get so, so rich. He's a fraudster. He's a sexual predator. He is a [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=543.76s)]
*  criminal. He's found liable for fraud. Donald Trump goes on to say the golden rule of negotiating [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=550.56s)]
*  and success. He who has the gold makes the rules. Thank you. He who has the gold makes the rules. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=558.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, the FDA makes plans to end its routine safety inspection sources. Say US measles total [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=565.76s)]
*  climbs to 800 cases, 10 outbreaks across the country. Great job, Donald Trump and JFK and RFK [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=572.96s)]
*  Jr. Rather. Then you have Donald Trump, Department of Defense, Secretary Pete Hegseth. We're learning [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=580.48s)]
*  through more leaks as like all of his staff at the Department of Defense, all his senior leadership [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=588.64s)]
*  is either resigning or getting fired or he's accusing them of leaks. We've now learned that [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=594.0s)]
*  Hegseth had additional signal communications on that Signal text message app where he gave war plans [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=599.36s)]
*  to his wife, his brother, his personal lawyer on Signal. But the White House wants you to know, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=605.92s)]
*  no biggie, not a big deal at all. This is the White House's official response after learning [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=612.56s)]
*  that Hegseth was giving our war plans to wife, brother, personal lawyer. Another day, another [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=617.4399999999999s)]
*  old story back from the dead, the Trump-hating media continues to be obsessed with destroying [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=622.9599999999999s)]
*  anyone committed to President Trump's agenda. This time, the New York Times and all other fake [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=628.08s)]
*  news that repeat their garbage are enthusiastically taking the grievance of disgruntled former [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=632.96s)]
*  employees as the sole source for their article. They relied only on the words of people who were [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=638.72s)]
*  fired this week and appear to have a motive to sabotage the secretary and president's agenda. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=643.9200000000001s)]
*  So they're doubling down, tripling down all in on Pete Hegseth and sending our war plans [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=650.1600000000001s)]
*  via text message to his wife, to his brother, and to others, and then blaming disgruntled employees. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=657.44s)]
*  Trump people, Hegseth's crew, this is Hegseth's team who's giving this information out. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=665.44s)]
*  But if you listen to what Apollo, what the private equity firm Apollo is saying right now, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=673.2s)]
*  they're referring to the Trump recession as a voluntary trade reset recession. That's what [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=678.88s)]
*  they're referring to the Trump recession. Could you imagine what they would be saying right now [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=686.64s)]
*  if former President Biden was in charge? It is so utterly, utterly pathetic. But let me all show you [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=691.36s)]
*  this right here. This is from Charlie Angus, former Canadian member of parliament, a good [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=697.04s)]
*  friend of mine now, a leader of the Canadian resistance. Here's what he had to say. Play this [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=702.72s)]
*  clip. I think what's really concerning is that an idiot like Trump has been allowed to monkey [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=707.6s)]
*  wrench the global economy without anybody stepping in and saying, Whoa, Donald, what the heck are you [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=716.48s)]
*  doing? When we see him tariffing poor Madagascar because Madagascar doesn't buy enough product [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=722.08s)]
*  from the United States, Madagascar is too poor to buy product from the United States, but they [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=728.0s)]
*  offer Americans cheap chocolates. Donald Trump picks a fight with them. The on again, off again [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=731.44s)]
*  tariffs in terms of auto, nobody even knows where that stands. Right now, South Dakota is freaking [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=737.28s)]
*  out. North Dakota, the farmers in Montana, because you have an integrated border in terms of ag trade, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=742.96s)]
*  $70 billion. All that's in chaos right now. I think he's pushing us towards a major, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=749.4399999999999s)]
*  definitely an American recession, probably a global recession and maybe a depression if he doesn't [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=756.8s)]
*  step back, but it's up and down. And the thing that really strikes me about Trump and his crew [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=762.72s)]
*  is they're really, really tough until you stand up to them. And then they blink. And that's certainly [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=768.88s)]
*  what's happened with Canada and Canada has been very strong. And then they come back at it a second [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=774.08s)]
*  and a third time. The feeling I'm getting from Canadians is they don't care what Trump does next. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=778.8s)]
*  We're going to do what we're going to do. We're looking to rebuild our economy and we're going to [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=783.68s)]
*  do it without our former ally, our former friend, our former partner. We're going to have to take [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=787.76s)]
*  steps that we're going to take because we simply cannot trust the American regime anymore. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=792.32s)]
*  The weather is heating up and your nighttime bedroom temperature has a huge impact on your [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWtBCWCMOdE&t=798.88s)]
