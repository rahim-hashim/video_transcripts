# GOP Leaders LOSE IT on LIVE TV as Trump SUFFERS BACKLASH
**MeidasTouch:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s)
*  So the Trump regime is rolling out their new talking points regarding this disastrous budget bill, and they're saying that the 34 million able bodied Americans on Medicaid will now be working the farms as the Trump regime to ports, the migrant farm workers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=0.0s)]
*  This is you're going to work the farms for your health care right now or else. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=20.0s)]
*  This is what Trump's agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, said on Tuesday. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Here, play this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=28.88s)]
*  But I can't underscore enough. There will be no amnesty. The mass deportations continue, but in a strategic way, and we move the workforce towards automation and 100% American participation, which again with 34 million people, able bodied adults on Medicaid, we should be able to do that fairly quickly. Thank you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=29.76s)]
*  Then you had Magna Republican Congress member Stube or Stubes speaking on Fox about how lots of people are working 80 hours a week, and we should be cutting way more with government services. Here's what they were talking about on Fox. Let's play it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=48.8s)]
*  But within Medicaid, and I think this is where the messaging has been interesting. It's 80 hours a month that you have to show that you worked 80 hours a month. A lot of people, congressmen work 80 hours a week. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=66.96s)]
*  Things like that that were that were in those Medicaid decisions, those cuts. At the same time, you've got reconciliation coming. You've got rescissions coming. So aren't there more places that we can cut? And where would you be willing to make cuts in spending so that we don't completely blow out the debt in this country, which is already sitting at 37 trillion? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I support massive cuts to a whole entirety of government programs that we have. But unfortunately we have, well not unfortunately, but we have moderates in our party that obviously can't support the type of cuts that somebody like me would support. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=102.24s)]
*  80 hours a week, by the way, and city towers data is a week. Also, they're saying we ran up the debt in this disastrous budget bill. Now we gotta do something about y'all. Y'all did it. But if you listen to Maga Republican Jim Jordan, he's basically saying, you know how you know this was a good budget bill. He says the left hates it. We own the libs. Everybody were kicking people off of Medicaid, tens of millions of people, but we own the Libs. So that's all we care about is Maga Republicans here play this clip. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=116.56s)]
*  We have a great adult out there now who is in our welfare system. Guess what? That person is going to have to work that is fair to taxpayers. That's good for our economy. Maybe most importantly, that's actually good for that recipient for that individual gets them on a better path to to attaining work and skills and everything else to get to a better position in life. That is far from immoral. But we I always say David, we know this is a good bill because the left hates it and the left hates it because it does not impact. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=146.56s)]
*  No, it's good because the left hates it. By the way, if you want to see what Donald Trump's Homeland Security Secretary has been posting on her Instagram during these very serious times, it's photos of herself on horses and asking which should be her official governor portrait right now, which that's what she's posting on her Instagram. Anyway, I digress. Let's bring in Democratic Congress member Tom Swazee. New York's third congressional district is where you represent. It was a district that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=172.08s)]
*  voted for you as the Democrat, but split. They voted for Trump in the general election in 2024. What are you hearing right now in your district about the disastrous budget? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=202.08s)]
*  You know, not everybody knows about this budget yet. A lot of the calls that I get are from people that are from organizations, from hospitals, from not for profits, people that are freaking out about these Medicaid cuts, about the cut to the food program that are happening. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  Very, very concerned about how it's going to affect the hospitals and the not for profits that service some of the most needy people in our country. You know, this whole thing doesn't really add up. You know, it's not just the liberals like Jim Jordan saying that don't like this budget. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=228.8s)]
*  There were Republicans that actually voted for it that said awful things about it, that it was immoral and it was wrong. And, you know, it's bad for the rest of the country. Look at Lisa Murkowski. Look at Senator Josh Hawley. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=244.84s)]
*  Think of the different members of the Freedom Caucus that we're talking about how awful the deficit is. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=258.24s)]
*  Elon Musk talking about the deficit. This is going to be the biggest single deficit of any year ever in the history of the country because of this bill. So we're having these massive deficits. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=264.52000000000004s)]
*  We're cutting some of the most needy people off of their insurance. Remember the two thirds of the people on Medicaid. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=276.36s)]
*  Two thirds of the people in nursing homes are paid for with Medicaid. One tenth of all the veterans in America are paid for with Medicaid. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=283.44s)]
*  Most 92 percent of people who are able bodied are working with Medicaid right now. The people that aren't, it's usually a single parent who's got a disabled kid at home. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=289.4s)]
*  In circumstances you can't possibly imagine. So you're you're massive deficit. You're knocking these people off of their health care. You're going to cause health insurance prices to go up for all Americans. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=300.56s)]
*  And why are you doing it? To provide the biggest tax cut ever for some of the wealthiest people in our country. It really just doesn't add up. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=311.32000000000005s)]
*  You know they used to pretend that you know hey if we do all of this stuff it's going to trickle down and you're going to do well. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=318.92s)]
*  Now they're just kind of lying about things. I mean this this whole premise from the Magna Republicans that there are these 35 year old [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=326.36s)]
*  able bodied men who are like making it rain and getting rich off of Medicaid in their mother's basement when Medicaid [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  reimburses for medical procedures. I'm trying to think of this 35 year old who's playing video games who's like you know how I'm going to get rich. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=340.32000000000005s)]
*  I've got a L5 S1 tear. I'm going to go and get a procedure, a micro dissection. I'm going to get rich. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  It's unfathomable even those the talking points and then they start posting. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=354.59999999999997s)]
*  We've done it. We're protecting all of our seniors. We've guaranteed you no tax on Social Security. And they've repeated that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=359.4s)]
*  And it's not in it's not in the bill. It's you've been in politics for a long time. And look you know that politics can be a rough and tumble place. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=366.79999999999995s)]
*  But like these people are just this is like one of Trump's scams from back in the day with Trump University. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=376.91999999999996s)]
*  Counting on the fractured media environment that people aren't going to actually know what's going on. And Trump is the master of distraction. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=382.72s)]
*  You know when we were debating this you know 24 hour debates through the middle of the night about this you know as much as three weeks or a month ago when this thing really kicked off. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=389.36s)]
*  What were we hearing about. We were hearing about the plane from Qatar. The next week we're doing more debates. We're having more votes on this. We're doing more hearings more markups. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  What do we hear about. We hear about the Chinese tariffs. What happens next. We hear about the bombings in Israel. We hear about Iran. We hear about other things. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=410.44s)]
*  Trump will bring up any other topic. He'll go down to alligator alley down to the Everglades where he's going to do the alligator Alcatraz. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=420.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean he'll do whatever he can to not actually talk about this bill publicly in a broad way. Why. It's a loser. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=428.52s)]
*  People do not like the idea that we're cutting taxes for some of the wealthiest Americans unnecessarily. So they don't need it in this economy. They're doing great. They're making a lot of money from from their stock portfolio. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=437.32s)]
*  They don't need to have it needed for years. So they're cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans. They're hurting some of the people in the most desperate circumstances. You hear these stories of people on Medicaid. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=450.68s)]
*  Of these these parents with their disabled kids and people that have been through these awful tragic experiences with their health that are dependent on this as a lifeline. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=461.64s)]
*  You're going to see people's health insurance go up dramatically. You know we've for 10 years we've been hearing about them trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Obamacare. This is a backdoor way to get rid of some of the Obamacare stuff as well. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=473.71999999999997s)]
*  It's going to cost people's health care costs to go up. So big tax cuts most vulnerable people and the biggest deficit ever in the history of the country. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=485.12s)]
*  We're even Elon Musk is saying this is awful and irresponsible. The Freedom Caucus. This is awful and irresponsible. They voted for it anyway. So it's the whole thing is a ruse a sham a pickpocket. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  What happens when a person comes in and bumps into you and when they bump into you and you're distracted the other person picks your pocket. Well they're getting us all excited about you know the alligator Alcatraz has the the the the the the National Guard being activated in L.A. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=509.28s)]
*  The bombings in Iran the plane from Qatar whatever it is just something else not to talk about how awful this bill actually is. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=526.24s)]
*  Let's talk about the bipartisan immigration plan that that you have. I remember James Langford from Oklahoma. Magga Republican senator back a year and a half ago at this point was pushing a bipartisan immigration bill. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=537.44s)]
*  Very strong borders giving lots of money to law enforcement to deal with criminals and then treating people who have been here for a long time contributing and paying their taxes with dignity and creating pathways for people who have worked here their their whole lives or a long period of time to be able to to not have to hide in the shadows and to be able to to work and recognizing their accomplishments. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=554.24s)]
*  Democrats worked with Langford to come up with ways to soften some of the harsh things when it comes to asylum and there was a deal if you want to actually call a bill a beautiful bill actually one that could have made a major difference helped the economy. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=580.96s)]
*  But Donald Trump said kill it water and so Trump killed it. So this is a great example of what always talk about the pickpockets and him distracting. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=597.6s)]
*  Let's remember there was a bipartisan deal that would have secured the border and solved a lot of problems related to immigration that was negotiated by Democrats and Republicans Langford and Murphy. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  Republican and Democrat and Trump killed it. And when they asked him during the debate they said Mr. President you're very concerned about the border and you want to secure the border. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=616.84s)]
*  There's a bipartisan deal in the Senate right now the president president Biden says he'll sign it Kamala Harris says she supports it other Democrats in the House say they'll support it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=626.44s)]
*  Why did you kill that bill. You know what his answer was. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=635.24s)]
*  They're eating the cats they're eating the dogs they're eating the pets and we fell for it for six weeks we did funny memes and and you know dogs talking to cats and ha ha ha very funny but we never talked about the fact that Trump killed the bill. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=639.48s)]
*  Saying he wanted a border security. There was a bill for border security. He killed the bill. And so he distracted everybody. So right now the president has said something over the past couple of weeks. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=655.44s)]
*  That clip you had from the agricultural secretary is very disconcerting. Trump came out and said you know what we have all these people in in agriculture and in hospitality. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=666.5600000000001s)]
*  They're good people. They've been working hard for you know more than 10 years and they've been here a long time and the farmers need them and and maybe I have the right documentation. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=678.92s)]
*  Let's figure out a way to use common sense and to legalize these folks. And then Stephen Miller came in crashed in and said you know not forget that we're going after everybody we're going to deport everybody. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=689.3199999999999s)]
*  And then president came out again and said no we got to help the farmers. I love the farmers. I love the border. I want to secure the border but I love the farmers. I want to help the farmers. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=700.28s)]
*  So I wrote a letter to the president. I said Mr. President we have these folks in my district that have just been picked up by ice. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=707.5200000000001s)]
*  The guy's been working in the community for years. It's the same thing. They've been here for years. They don't have all the proper documentation but they've been here for more than 10 years. No criminal activity. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=715.96s)]
*  Nobody. Nobody should disagree with the idea of deporting violent criminals. That's a reasonable thing to do. And we should do that. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=724.24s)]
*  But now we're getting all these innocent folks getting caught up in this whole thing and people are living in fear. People are afraid to report things to the police because they're afraid of getting entrapped in the process. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=731.72s)]
*  So I wrote a letter to the president said Mr. President I've been listening to you very carefully. Let's make a deal. Let's make a deal to permanently secure the border not just from executive orders but have Congress do bipartisan support so that we really can secure the border for the future. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=743.4s)]
*  Let's fix the broken asylum system that's being abused by the cartels and the coyotes that are collecting 10,000 dollars a person and telling people how to game the system. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=757.48s)]
*  And most importantly let's build this coalition of business badges in the Bible and put [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=766.9599999999999s)]
*  the community behind the idea of legalizing people that have been here for more than 10 years that have otherwise been playing by the rules. They go to work six days a week. They go to church on Sunday. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=773.88s)]
*  Let's let them live a life. They don't have to have citizenship. Forget about a pathway to citizenship. Just give them legalization so they can go to work. They can pay their taxes. They can take care of their families. They can stop looking over their shoulder. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=783.72s)]
*  That's somebody Jack Boothog is going to come in and try and pick them up. So there's a deal to be made here. The question is whether the president really wants to secure his legacy and has the guts to stand up to the extremists that really want to try and get rid of everybody and make everybody's life miserable. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=795.36s)]
*  You look at his life though it seems that it's always been filled with chaos that ultimately leads to bankruptcies and then he blames somebody for the problem and then moves on to the next one. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=810.08s)]
*  He's personally enriched and his life has been hopping to the next the next the next one. And then he said look these were this Republican Party is is is ripe is ripe for it with the greed with the with everything you know they'll they'll fall for this dick. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=823.48s)]
*  He found his mark took him over you know is running it. And now you know it's just weird stuff that you see. I mean with some of the strangest stuff and what we'll believe with this I just want to get your take on it because again you've been in politics for a while. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=838.52s)]
*  I mean just seeing some of your colleagues out there who we need to give him a Nobel Peace Prize. Oh he's so wise. He's the smartest guy ever. It's like just it's just some strange be some strange stuff. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=852.48s)]
*  I want to make a deal with the president on immigration. I'd love to. But it was killing me during the whole big beautiful bill debate during the whole thing that was in the middle of the whole thing. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=864.6s)]
*  He did something on truth social to advertise his new Trump fragrance. I was like oh my gosh what has happened to our country. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=874.76s)]
*  So it's just I have to imagine though you're looking I grew up in New York's third which was once New York's second. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=883.48s)]
*  You know they don't like that weirdo stuff like they don't like like they look at that and I know how you know I know how they I understand even though I strongly disagree with it how they could fall for some of this stuff and now there it's being exposed as a lie. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=889.24s)]
*  But I just can see the people waking up and it's gone. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=903.04s)]
*  Like people's families getting separated and you know ice guys wearing masks and picking up otherwise innocent people you know. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=907.0400000000001s)]
*  Go after the criminals you know get them out of here. I'm with you. Let's do that. But the stuff that they're doing now is just over the top and we're concerned. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=917.44s)]
*  Because there's so much money being put into ice and into the border security stuff. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=926.84s)]
*  We have to marry that with actually legalizing a bunch of people and I'm hoping we can break through to the president because it's it could be very scary quite frankly. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=931.88s)]
*  And we you know I have I have all these different people in my district I have people voted for Trump he won by 19,000 votes in my district. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=940.96s)]
*  He will go to for me I won by 11,000 votes so I've got Democrats in one year you know is more the base people saying you know this is the end of the world. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=947.44s)]
*  He's destroying democracy we have to stop this guy. This is awful. I got other people in the other year saying well you got to break some eggs to make an omelet. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=956.2800000000001s)]
*  You know we got to we got to try and you know change some stuff the government's not working we got to fix some stuff and we've got most of the people in the middle saying. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=963.6s)]
*  What are you guys doing can't you like just work things out. What about me. What about my life. What are you doing to help make my life better. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=970.72s)]
*  Can't you work together and actually solve some problems and the natural inclination is you know punch counter punch. That's the normal behavior of anybody. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=977.0s)]
*  And Trump is a real puncher. He's always knocking people always hitting people always trying to pick a fight. And the natural reaction of most of us most human beings is to punch back. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=986.2800000000001s)]
*  But if we keep this punch counter punch thing eye for an eye we're all going to end up end up blind. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=996.64s)]
*  So we got to figure out how to rise above this and figure out OK let's find places to actually solve some problems. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=1001.28s)]
*  Now that's hard to do especially in this environment with some of the crazy stuff that we see happening. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=1010.8s)]
*  But that's our obligation. That's why I'm in politics. That's why I'm in it. I've been doing this off and on for 30 years. It's not worth it. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=1017.4s)]
*  To win a race or to get your name in the newspaper or to or to make a speech. It's only if you actually get stuff done to make people's lives better that makes this worthwhile. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=1024.68s)]
*  And you talk about Trump going from this thing from that thing to the next thing. Well this is you know he's 80 years old or whatever he is 79 years old. This is it. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=1036.0s)]
*  He's not running again in 2028. Even with all the rumors and conspiracy he's not running again. So he ought to be thinking about what's his legacy going to be. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=1044.1599999999999s)]
*  He's obviously one of the most important figures in the modern generation. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=1052.6s)]
*  What's his reputation going to be when this is all said and done. The only way he's going to have a positive legacy legacy is if he actually makes some bipartisan deals. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=1058.6s)]
*  There'll be long lasting that will actually make things better for people. This idea of he's got to win every fight and knock everybody down in the process will not last. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=1068.32s)]
*  And people will not end up ultimately going for some of the more dramatic stuff especially you know selling the fragrances. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywE1fJD378s&t=1076.88s)]
