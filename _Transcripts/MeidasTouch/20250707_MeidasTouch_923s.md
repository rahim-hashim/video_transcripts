*  Awarding Donald Trump the Nobel Peace Prize [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=286.44s)]

*  Thank you. It's great. So then Donald Trump is asked by a reporter [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=321.08s)]
*  Okay, so you've moved the tariff deadline from July 9th to August 1st [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=325.24s)]
*  So is the August 1st deadline now firm and Trump's like well, it's firm, but it's not firm [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=330.44s)]
*  Taco play this clip and the August 1st deadline [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=335.76s)]
*  I mean is the August 1st deadline firm now? Is that it? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=338.72s)]
*  I would say firm, but not a hundred percent firm if they call up and they say [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=342.72s)]
*  Would like to do something a different way. We're gonna be open to that. But essentially that's the way it is right now [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=348.24s)]
*  And here Donald Trump is rambling again. Let's play it [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=354.0s)]
*  Mr. President are the tariff letters that you sent today final off? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=357.04s)]
*  Final offers or they go less final over so South Korea Japan should take it. We're always subject to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=364.96s)]
*  Negotiate something that's fair, but we've talked to most of the countries and pretty much they've had their way for many many decades as you know [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=371.56s)]
*  And it was time that we just wanted fairness. This is [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=379.68s)]
*  Not really equitable from our standpoint because it's just a small token by comparison to the damage [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=383.6s)]
*  It's been done over the years, but we had no other president that was willing to do this [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=390.48s)]
*  Then Donald Trump says that his bombing of Iran reminded him of Truman dropping nukes on Japan [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  You're play this clip when you think and carrying that biggest bombs ever [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=401.32s)]
*  The biggest bombs that we've ever dropped on anybody when you think non nuclear and we want to keep it non nuclear [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=406.32s)]
*  By the way, but they did a phenomenal job [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=414.24s)]
*  Amazing job and I think that was I was talking to BB about it before that was [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=418.12s)]
*  The very beginning of the end and ended very quickly after that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=422.76s)]
*  I don't want to say what it reminded me of but if you go back a long time ago [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=425.84s)]
*  it reminded people of a certain other event and is [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=430.52s)]
*  Harry Truman's pictures now in the lobby in a nice location of the lobby where it should have been but that stopped [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=436.0s)]
*  A lot of fighting and this stopped a lot of fighting when that happened. It was a whole different ballgame [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=442.52s)]
*  So a quick PSA for those of you on Medicare the DOJ recently sued three of the largest Medicare brokers and carriers [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=447.52s)]
*  For allegedly deceiving customers claiming to be unbiased while pushing them into plans that don't actually cover their needs all [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=456.0s)]
*  To make a few extra bucks [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=463.96s)]
*  Let's be real between Medicare scams [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=465.88s)]
*  Shady agents and bloated insurance companies. It's way too easy to get stuck in a plan [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=468.91999999999996s)]
*  That's overpriced or just plain wrong for you. That is why I'm working with chapter [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=474.91999999999996s)]

*  Chapters help is completely free completely free. There's no sales pressure [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=495.96s)]
*  No pushing plans you don't need just real advice that puts you first people save an average of [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=501.44s)]
*  $1,100 by using chapter [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=510.0s)]
*  So if you're turning 65 soon or are already on Medicare call them up at 82 [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=511.71999999999997s)]

*  And that's respect when they do that I appreciated that they did that there was no surprise we got the soldiers out of [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=570.64s)]
*  The base in Qatar in this case [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=578.1199999999999s)]
*  But they knew they were coming 14 missiles were coming then Donald Trump attacks [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=580.92s)]
*  Zoran Mamdani play it [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=586.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna come there with the president Trump and we'll see [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=591.4399999999999s)]
*  What the how do you know who the mayor will be? I don't know that [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=597.0799999999999s)]
*  He's gonna be very fine and who knows we don't know who the mayor is gonna be yet [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=601.1199999999999s)]
*  But this is a communist. He's not a socialist [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=605.9599999999999s)]
*  He's a communist and he said some really bad things about Jewish people and he said some really bad things about a lot of people [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=608.5999999999999s)]
*  And I think he's going through a little bit of a honeymoon right now, but he might make it [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=615.4s)]
*  But you know, it all comes through the White House. He needs the money through the White House. He needs a lot [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=620.3199999999999s)]
*  He's gonna behave he'll behave he better behave [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=624.76s)]
*  Otherwise, you're gonna have big problems [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=627.3000000000001s)]
*  But it's a philosophy that this country is not ready for and it never will be Trump is asked if he supports a two-state solution [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=628.74s)]
*  to which Donald Trump puns to Benjamin Netanyahu and says baby you answer the question baby and [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=637.1s)]
*  then Benjamin Netanyahu was like well, we wouldn't want to commit suicide and [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=644.74s)]
*  No one should be held prisoners [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=650.3000000000001s)]
*  Seriously after what we're seeing go down in Gaza, that's that's what your response right here is seeing the women and children [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=652.66s)]
*  die in Gaza every day and and what's becoming didn't Trump and [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=661.24s)]
*  Netanyahu say they were gonna end and they bring peace. This is just horrible stuff here play this clip [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=666.26s)]
*  Do you think that there could be a two-state solution that creates an independent? I don't know [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=672.0s)]
*  I asked me that question [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=676.66s)]
*  You have the greatest man in the world to answer that age-old question to state go ahead you give him your honest answer [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=677.82s)]
*  I think the Palestinians should have all the powers to govern themselves, but none of the powers to threaten us [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=684.7s)]
*  That means that certain powers like overall security will always remain in our hands [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=691.82s)]
*  Now that is a fact and no one in Israel will [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=697.6600000000001s)]
*  Agree to anything else because we don't commit suicide. We want life we cherish life [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=702.72s)]
*  For ourselves or our neighbors, and I think we can work out a piece between us and the entire Middle East [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  with President Trump's leadership [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=716.96s)]
*  And by working together, I think we can establish a very very broad piece [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=719.48s)]
*  That will include all our neighbors. Of course, they lie about everything [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=725.08s)]
*  And then a reporter asked Donald Trump [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=729.24s)]
*  Tell us about your Palestinian relocation plan. Is that still on the table? And then Donald Trump again says no, baby [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=732.44s)]
*  You you could answer then he goes well [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=739.96s)]
*  They have free will if they want to leave they can leave how do they have free will? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=742.48s)]
*  Then of course there should be a two-state solution. What are we even talking about here here play this clip? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=747.16s)]
*  Any progress [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=758.8000000000001s)]
*  Maybe what are I letting you answer that question? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=760.8000000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, wait a minute. He's gonna answer. I think President Trump had a brilliant vision. It's called free choice [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=763.36s)]
*  You know people want to stay they can stay [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=771.44s)]
*  But if they want to leave they should be able to leave it shouldn't be a you know [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=775.08s)]
*  Prison should be an open place and give people a free choice [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=778.48s)]
*  Then Donald Trump talks about having the pilots at the White House and saying that the pilots were here [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=782.4s)]
*  And then we also had mechanics. I think about 170 people here play this clip, you know, it's very very interesting [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=788.24s)]
*  We had the pilots here [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=795.24s)]
*  yesterday's you know and [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=797.2800000000001s)]
*  They were incredible and we also had the mechanics [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=799.1600000000001s)]
*  We had a lot of people here that had to do it a lot of you [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=802.72s)]
*  I think about 170 people that had to do with that incredible journey a journey that could have been horrible [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=805.6800000000001s)]
*  You remember what happened with Jimmy Carter with the helicopters and all of the problems and ultimately hostages [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=812.6s)]
*  We had the exact opposite everything was perfect. It worked perfectly, but I didn't realize I [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=819.32s)]
*  Was saying to one is this something that you felt strongly about absolutely, sir? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=824.84s)]
*  I couldn't wait. I said better than you really better you than me, but they couldn't wait [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=829.6800000000001s)]
*  He said sir [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=835.08s)]
*  We've been practicing for this mission for more than 20 years and then Donald Trump describes [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=836.0s)]
*  Putin's war on Ukraine as a Biden created monster here [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=841.36s)]
*  Watch this and they were maybe at a nuclear stage at both, you know nuclear powers [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=845.88s)]
*  And I think something that was very important [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=850.68s)]
*  We're trying to help out with a Biden created monster this whole thing that's happening with Russia and Ukraine [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=853.04s)]
*  It's a horrible. It's a horrible thing and I'm not happy with President Putin at all [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=859.88s)]
*  But this is something that would have never happened if I were president [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=865.5600000000001s)]
*  This is a war that was never going to happen. And by the way, no one asked him about the Epstein files [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=869.24s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how as a reporter you don't go and ask him now [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=874.0400000000001s)]
*  you're claiming the Epstein files don't exist and [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=879.0400000000001s)]
*  You claim that there is no list after Donald Trump's now praising Dan Bongino and [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=882.12s)]
*  Cash Patel who lead the FBI after they told us that there were the Epstein files that exist [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThklB4nVno&t=889.0400000000001s)]
