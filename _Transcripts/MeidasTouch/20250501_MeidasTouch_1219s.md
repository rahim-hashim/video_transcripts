# Fox News PANICS ON AIR over Trump’s HEALTH ISSUES
**MeidasTouch:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U)
*  If you want to see Fox, just absolutely lose it. Bring up Donald Trump's accelerating cognitive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=0.0s)]
*  decline. If you even raise the question, they have a utter freakout. So when I had Democratic [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=6.8s)]
*  leader Hakeem Jeffries on the Midas Touch Network earlier this week, I asked him, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=14.16s)]
*  do you think it's a fair question that we raise Donald Trump's cognitive decline as a [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=18.72s)]
*  significant issue right now? And he goes, when he travels the country, he gets the question frequently. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=24.0s)]
*  And he said, looking at Donald Trump's conduct, he understands why people are raising that issue [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  with him. And he says he thinks it's a fair question. So throughout the entire day yesterday, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=34.32s)]
*  Fox was focused on why would Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries ever bring this up? And he should [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=39.28s)]
*  be talking about former President Biden. Just take a look over here at this Chiron. It says, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=45.76s)]
*  Jeffries, fair to question Trump's mental acuity. And like on the Will Cain show, they brought on [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=51.04s)]
*  Democratic Congress member Dan Goldman, and they asked Congress member Goldman, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=57.92s)]
*  come on, come on, Congressman, how could you ever possibly raise an issue about Donald Trump's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=62.64s)]
*  mental issues? How could you ever do that? Watch what Democratic Congress member Goldman said in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=68.4s)]
*  response, play this clip. I can debate you on each and every one of those things you just laid out, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=73.12s)]
*  but I don't think you can call it whatever you want. I think that's an incorrect statement, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=77.2s)]
*  Congressman. I think words have meaning and they matter. And I think you know that. I think we have [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  to be careful with our words, especially if we're not trying to inflame the public, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=84.16s)]
*  and most certainly if we're trying to arrive at the truth. And after four years of having us [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=87.52s)]
*  gaslighted over the competency, the mental acuity of the previous president, it's absurd to question, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=92.24s)]
*  even if you disagree, Congressman, and clearly you do with much of the president, the competency of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=99.92s)]
*  the sitting president today. I think the accuracy and truth of those words do matter. Well, I don't [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=104.64s)]
*  think he's competent, Will. I don't know what to tell you, whether his cognitive abilities are [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=110.24s)]
*  sufficient to get past the 25th Amendment. You know, we don't know that right now. But I think [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=114.8s)]
*  what is clear is that he has driven our country into a disastrous economy. He has undermining the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=120.88s)]
*  fundamental rule of law and democracy. He is taking away benefits in order to cut taxes for the rich. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  I think even you, Will, would have to agree with me that this first hundred days is not at all what [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=135.04s)]
*  he promised the American people. No, I'm sorry to notify you. I do not agree with you. I think [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=140.08s)]
*  this first hundred days is exactly what he promised the American people, and more importantly, exactly [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=146.24s)]
*  what- I loved how Congressmember Goldman said that, look, it seems pretty obvious that Donald Trump [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=150.08s)]
*  is having cognitive issues. Now, you can go back to 2019, when Donald Trump took this secret trip [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=155.36s)]
*  to Walter Reed. There were many people at the time that were suspecting that Donald Trump may have [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  been experiencing many strokes, because right around the time and thereafter, he really started [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=167.68s)]
*  slurring his words. And there are lots of people who opined on that. And I'll talk about that in a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=172.96s)]
*  moment. And I want to be very clear. I'm not a medical doctor. I've taken a look at what medical [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=177.68s)]
*  doctors have said and opinions that they've given. I'm just expressing my opinion right now. But it [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=182.72s)]
*  seems this is a very sensitive topic for Fox and also for, like, Donald Trump's communications [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=188.0s)]
*  director in the White House, Steve Chung. So just take a look at what Steve Chung posted this past [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=194.64s)]
*  week. He goes, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  CNN had this blithering idiot on inside politics from the Daily Beast named Joanna Coles making [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=200.39999999999998s)]
*  unsubstantiated claims about President Trump's health. Joanna is a piece of shit, clearly [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=206.64s)]
*  suffering from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome, rotting her pea-sized [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  brain. So I went to see, like, what did Joanna Coles from the Daily Beast even say [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  when she was interviewed? And I'll play the clip for you. She basically said, like, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=223.2s)]
*  not a lot here. Watch this clip. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=228.48s)]
*  Donald Trump in a blue suit when we know he has a black suit because he was wearing a black suit the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  last time he met the Pope. So why wasn't he wearing it this time? Lots of suspicion because [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=235.28s)]
*  he's lost a lot of weight. Who knows how he's lost weight. We know that Robert Kennedy Jr., [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=239.76s)]
*  his health minister, doesn't approve of people taking a Zempik because he thinks it shows a [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=245.68s)]
*  lack of moral power. So who knows how Trump has lost weight, but I found the suit color very [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=250.64s)]
*  interesting. So if you see what's happening here, you've got Fox and Donald Trump's communications [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=256.24s)]
*  director, Stephen Chung. They're kind of telling on themselves here, right, that this is a very [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  sensitive issue for them. So go back now to 2019 for a second when Donald Trump took that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=268.4s)]
*  visit to Walter Reed. And I want to share this with you. This was a doctor that CNN had a guy [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=274.32s)]
*  by the name of Dr. David Shiner. He was President Obama's former doctor, and they had him on CNN to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=280.8s)]
*  talk about, and this was in Donald Trump's first administration, to talk about whether or not Donald [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=289.52s)]
*  Trump was having many strokes or whether there was some cognitive issues there. Play this clip. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=295.36s)]
*  His inability to say words sometimes worries me tremendously. He is having trouble word finding [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=300.16s)]
*  when he said United States, these aren't words, these aren't slips of the tongue. These are words [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=307.44s)]
*  he can't find them. And this is happening over and over again. Comedians joke about it, but it's not [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=313.44000000000005s)]
*  a joking matter. I think there is a neurological issue that is not being addressed. And if he had [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=318.88s)]
*  an MRI of his head over there, I would be very pleased because I think he needs it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  Could have happened in the two hour time he was there. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=330.16s)]
*  Yes, it certainly could. And it's the worry that I have is that maybe he's having small strokes. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  And we had that once before in the White House when Woodrow Wilson was president. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=340.0s)]
*  His inability to find words is peculiar and has not been explained. And I think one has to think [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=345.6s)]
*  of it as a possible neurological issue. Now, I think it's important to note when we talk [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  about Donald Trump's accelerating cognitive decline, I want to be very careful because I [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=357.28s)]
*  also don't want Donald Trump to use that as an out to avoid accountability one day and say, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=362.08s)]
*  oh, it was because I had physical issues. This is why I behave the way I did. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=369.67999999999995s)]
*  As Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries told me, it also is just the truth that Donald Trump is a total [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=374.4s)]
*  liar in every single thing that Donald Trump does. So whether it's because Donald Trump is [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=380.8s)]
*  experiencing severe cognitive decline or he's just a total liar or both, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  that all can be the case. Here's what Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries told me this week when I [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=393.36s)]
*  interviewed him here, play this clip. Donald Trump spent the last year and a [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=399.44s)]
*  half questioning the cognitive ability of President Joe Biden, notwithstanding many of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=403.52s)]
*  the legislative accomplishments that Donald Trump could only wish he got over the finish line. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=408.4s)]
*  And so I think it's fair that a lot of Americans across the country that I run into [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  are questioning whether Donald Trump is actually fit at this point to be able to carry out the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=418.4s)]
*  duties of the United States of America in terms of being the president and the commander in chief. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=423.84s)]
*  You ever have one of those date nights where you're scrambling to find the perfect outfit, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=430.32s)]
*  something that looks great, fits right, but still gives you some breathing room for that steak dinner? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=433.28s)]
*  Yeah, I've been there. You start with something that looks good in the mirror, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=437.44s)]
*  but by the time you sit down at the restaurant, that tailored fit is suddenly feeling more like [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=440.24s)]
*  a compression shirt. That's why I love True Classic. Their shirts are actually designed [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=444.32s)]
*  with real people in mind, snug in the chest and arms where you want that clean look, but with just [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=449.6s)]
*  the right amount of room in the midsection so you're not regretting that extra side of mashed [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=454.64s)]
*  potatoes. And it's not just the tees. The curved hem crew, the knit Oxford, and their compact knit [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=459.04s)]
*  chinos are all game changers for date night. They're stylish, they fit perfectly, and unlike [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=464.72s)]
*  most clothes with this kind of tailored look, they don't come with a ridiculous price tag. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  And let's talk about winter essentials. Long sleeve Henleys, fleece hoodies, button ups, joggers. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=474.08000000000004s)]
*  True Classic has everything you need to mix, match, and build the perfect outfit in minutes. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=479.76000000000005s)]
*  Literally, this second I'm wearing my True Classic tee, sweatpants, and even boxer briefs. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  Sorry if that's TMI. Plus, they offer free shipping on all orders and a 100% perfect fit [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=490.32s)]

*  Going back to the incident at Walter Reed, when you had Ronnie Jackson, now Congressmember Jackson [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=515.0400000000001s)]
*  from Texas, when he was Trump's doctor, here's what he said when he was asked about [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=524.08s)]
*  Donald Trump potentially having mini strokes at that time. Here, play this clip. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=530.72s)]
*  There was an incident recently where the president appeared to slur his words [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=536.32s)]
*  while giving an address. Did you look into what the cause of that might have been at all? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=540.1600000000001s)]
*  I did. Yeah, we talked about that. And actually, one of my ENT consultants was involved in that. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=544.96s)]
*  We evaluated him. We checked everything out. And everything was normal. We even went so far as to [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=551.5200000000001s)]
*  do an ultrasound of his parotid glands and a few other things. And there was absolutely no [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=556.88s)]
*  clinical findings that would suggest. I think the reason for that was quite... [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=562.0s)]
*  I'm not sure if you remember, Donald Trump had to put out statements back then, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=565.52s)]
*  denying that he had a series of mini strokes. And here's the statement that was made by another [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=569.52s)]
*  doctor, Dr. Sean P. Conley. Donald Trump has asked that I, Dr. Sean Conley, physician to the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=575.36s)]
*  president, address the recent public comments regarding his health. I can confirm that President [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=581.68s)]
*  Trump has not experienced nor been evaluated for strokes, mini strokes, or any acute cardiovascular [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=586.48s)]
*  emergencies, as have been incorrectly reported in the media. The president remains healthy, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=593.84s)]
*  and I have no concerns about his ability to maintain the rigorous schedule ahead of him. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=599.2s)]
*  As stated in my last report, I expect him to remain fit to execute the duties of the president. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=604.24s)]
*  But do you notice that nobody really talks about that anymore today, except here on the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=611.36s)]
*  Minus Touch Network? One of the red flags that I think exist as well is, if you take a look at [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=616.08s)]
*  Donald Trump's recent physical that was released a few weeks back, the way it described that he [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=621.92s)]
*  was in good health is it said, he's in good health as evidenced by his frequent victories [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=627.8399999999999s)]
*  in golf events, it said. It also claimed he was like 6'3", 220, which he obviously isn't. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=634.0s)]
*  But again, you go back, because the past really kind of informs, I think, how we need to look at [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=641.12s)]
*  it today. Donald Trump's doctor back in 2015, 2016, who's no longer alive, Dr. Harold Bornstein, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=647.6s)]
*  who was a gastroenterologist, he did Trump's doctor note back in 2015. This was Trump's doctor note, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=656.88s)]
*  or medical report, back when Trump was running for office the first time. It says, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=665.9200000000001s)]
*  to whom my concern, not to whom may concern, to whom my concern. And then as you read through it, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=671.36s)]
*  it talks about how Donald Trump's physical was astonishingly excellent. He was extraordinary. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=677.92s)]
*  And then it says, he will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=685.84s)]
*  And it's signed over here by Dr. Harold Bornstein, a gastroenterologist. I mean, obviously, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=691.36s)]
*  to whom my concern is red flag number one. Two, why is a gastroenterologist writing this report? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=697.36s)]
*  Three, using language over and over again, like the most astonishingly excellent person and saying, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=704.88s)]
*  he will be the healthiest individual ever. One of the things we know as well is that Donald Trump [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=710.72s)]
*  sent people back in 2018 to raid Dr. Harold Bornstein's office. Let me just show you what [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=718.0s)]
*  Dr. Howard Bornstein said on May 1st, 2018 about Trump sending goons to raid his office. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=724.72s)]
*  And then another thing that Dr. Harold Bornstein told CNN was that Donald Trump was actually the [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=755.0400000000001s)]
*  person who wrote his own physical. That medical note that I just read was actually written by [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=765.44s)]
*  Donald Trump and not Dr. Harold Bornstein. Let me just play a clip of CNN reporting what Dr. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=770.88s)]
*  Harold Bornstein told them in May of 2018. Let's play this clip right here. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=777.2s)]
*  Right outside his office on Park Avenue. He told us in no uncertain terms, and this is the quote, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=784.96s)]
*  Aaron, he dictated, he being Trump, he dictated that whole letter, I didn't write that letter. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=790.08s)]
*  Meaning that Trump dictated what he wanted to go into it and essentially Bornstein wrote it up. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  He compared it to the movie Fargo and he said, it takes the truth and moves it in a different [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=802.8000000000001s)]
*  direction. Think about that. Now, Bornstein tells us that he was in a car with his wife when he was [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=808.1600000000001s)]
*  on the phone with then candidate Trump in December of 2015. And she was going through with Trump what [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=813.6s)]
*  he could say and what he couldn't say. Trump was dictating what he wanted in that letter. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=820.72s)]
*  And Bornstein was saying, okay, you can say that. You can't say that. He then came here to the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=825.28s)]
*  office. He wrote it up. Trump's office later picked it up. He said around 4 PM, Aaron, we have reached [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=829.44s)]
*  out to the White House, but we have not gotten a response. And so let me just show you a portion [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=834.64s)]
*  of that interview one more time that has since gone very viral of Terry Moran from ABC and Donald [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=839.36s)]
*  Trump in the Oval Office, where Donald Trump believes that what was clearly photoshopped [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=845.92s)]
*  on Abrego Garcia's hands, the letters MS-13 are clearly computer-typed font and it's not the [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=853.28s)]
*  tattoos. But Donald Trump is arguing and I want you to watch Donald Trump's just physical behavior. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=862.8s)]
*  I want you to view it from a kind of psychological perspective as you're watching him and just the [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  weird stuff he's doing with his body and his face and the way he's looking at Terry Moran and saying, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=876.4s)]
*  no, Terry, no, Terry, that's real. It says MS-13. I see it, Terry. You're wrong, Terry. The way he's [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=882.0s)]
*  like looking and trying to intimidate Terry Moran, the fact that he thinks that it actually [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=887.92s)]
*  says MS-13 with the letters MS and the numbers one three, it doesn't. And it's not just that. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=893.52s)]
*  It's also him making up fake conversations that never happened with China and saying that he's [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=901.28s)]
*  speaking to Xi Jinping. It's Donald Trump lying about saying he's done 200 deals. There's only 193 [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=906.64s)]
*  countries. Donald Trump talking about Donald Trump tariffing penguins. The way Donald Trump [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=913.2s)]
*  looked and behaved at Pope Francis' funeral. We can see this thing with our own eyes. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=921.5200000000001s)]
*  Here Donald Trump is in the Oval Office interview with Terry Moran from ABC here, play this clip. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=927.6s)]
*  Well, he had some tattoos that are interpreted that way, but let's move on. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=944.08s)]
*  Wait a minute. Hey, Terry, Terry, Terry. He did not have the letter MS-13. It says MS-13. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=948.48s)]
*  That was Photoshopped. So let me just- That was Photoshopped. Terry, you can't do that. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=954.8000000000001s)]
*  Hey, they're giving you the big break of a lifetime. You know, you're doing the interview. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=959.2s)]
*  I picked you because frankly, I never heard of you, but that's okay. I picked you, Terry, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=962.5600000000001s)]
*  but you're not being very nice. He had MS-13 tattooed- [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=968.0s)]
*  We'll agree to disagree. I want to move on to something else. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=971.04s)]
*  Terry, do you want me to show you the picture? I saw the picture. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=972.88s)]
*  We'll agree to disagree. And you think it was Photoshopped. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=976.88s)]
*  Well, here we go. Here we go. Don't Photoshop it. Don't look at his hand. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=979.12s)]
*  He had MS-13. He did have tattoos that can be interpreted that way. I'm not an expert on them. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=981.5999999999999s)]
*  I want to turn to Ukraine. No, no. Terry, Terry. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=985.68s)]
*  I want to get to Ukraine. No, no. No, no. He had MS as clear as you can be, not interpreted. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=987.12s)]
*  This is why people no longer believe the news because it's fake news. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=994.0s)]
*  In El Salvador, they aren't there, but let's just go. They aren't there when he's in El Salvador. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=998.48s)]
*  Oh, they want to look at the photo. They're there now, right? No, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1004.0799999999999s)]
*  they're in your picture. Terry, he's got MS-13 on his knuckles. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1007.28s)]
*  Okay. We'll take a look. It's such a disservice. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1012.88s)]
*  We'll take a look. Why don't you just say yes, he does. And, you know, go on to something else. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1015.92s)]
*  He's contested. Right. And then what does Donald Trump consistently keep on talking about when he's [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1020.56s)]
*  on Air Force One and usually coming back from golf after a weekend of golfing? He keeps talking [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1026.4s)]
*  about taking physical exams and acing cognitive tests. He keeps doing that again. So I pass [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1034.24s)]
*  cognitive tests here, play this clip. Time to go. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1039.0400000000002s)]
*  Long time to yearly physical. I think I did well. I think they're releasing the report on Sunday. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1041.8400000000001s)]
*  Doctors, highly respected doctors, great guys, great, amazing place. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1050.4s)]
*  Did they give you any suggestions or advice? Anything you need to change up? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1054.32s)]
*  A little bit, but overall I think I felt I was in very good shape, good heart, a good soul, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1060.32s)]
*  very good soul. And I took, I wanted to be a little different than I took a cognitive test [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1068.24s)]
*  that I don't know what to tell you whether that I got every answer right. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1077.6s)]
*  And then of course you remember during the campaign, he would say over and over again [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1081.92s)]
*  that people keep saying he's cognitively impaired, he's cognitively impaired. Here, play this clip. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1087.8400000000001s)]
*  They're saying he's cognitively impaired and physically impaired. There's something wrong [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1094.3200000000002s)]
*  with them all because I have guys that are stupid back there. All right. What are you going to do? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1100.24s)]
*  What are you going to do? Right. What a shame. But we're going to come back. I'm going to give [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1105.6000000000001s)]
*  you a free performance back in that corner. You got a bad area back there, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1110.96s)]
*  but I think this is better. I think it's probably better. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1115.68s)]
*  You know, I think about what Senator Bernie Sanders told me and he said, you know, Ben, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1119.04s)]
*  sometimes the things that are kind of most obvious and are most glaring are the things [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1124.0s)]
*  that are discussed the least. And I think if you put all the puzzle pieces together and go, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1131.6000000000001s)]
*  okay, corporate news isn't reporting on this. That's kind of strange because it seems pretty [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1138.6399999999999s)]
*  obvious. Fox gets very worried the moment it's mentioned and devote a ton of coverage to trying [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1143.6s)]
*  to swat it down. You had Donald Trump's communications director, Steven Chung, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1149.9199999999998s)]
*  freak out when Joanna Coles basically said nothing even that significant about Donald Trump's health. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1156.1599999999999s)]
*  And we just observe his behavior right now. As I said before, I don't want this to be used [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1163.36s)]
*  as an out for Donald Trump to one day avoid accountability. And I don't want to just try [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1169.9199999999998s)]
*  to blame his disgusting behavior on a physical issue because there could be complex explanations [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1176.32s)]
*  because he's still violent. He's still disgusting. But I think it's something that needs to be talked [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1183.52s)]
*  about more. I'm going to use the platform to talk about Donald Trump's declining cognitive issues [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1188.1599999999999s)]
*  more. But you see that it certainly is very worrisome to Fox. Let me know what you think. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBStjwQA3U&t=1192.96s)]
