# Trump Admin makes SHOCK ADMISSION on MASSIVE LEAKS
**MeidasTouch:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c)
*  As the Trump administration continues to blame the leakers for Secretary of Defense Pete [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=0.0s)]
*  Hegseth having these classified war plans and signal chats, now we're learning about to his wife [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  and to his brother and to his personal lawyer, now I thought a rather stunning admission was made by [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=12.72s)]
*  Donald Trump's press secretary, Caroline Levitt, yesterday during the press conference where [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=18.56s)]
*  she says the reason she's so angry at the leakers who are Hegseth's own handpicked people is because [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=23.84s)]
*  this is very sensitive information, but at the same time Hegseth and Trump and others have been [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=30.64s)]
*  saying it's not sensitive information even though we all know it is war plans and sensitive information, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=37.04s)]
*  but watch what Caroline Levitt said yesterday. Let's play this clip. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=42.96s)]
*  We're Hegseth's own guy, so how do you square that and what do you say to concerns that that's bad management? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=53.84s)]
*  They were Pentagon employees who leaked against their boss to news agencies in this room and it's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  been clear since day one from this administration that we are not going to tolerate individuals who [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=66.80000000000001s)]
*  leak to the mainstream media, particularly when it comes to sensitive information. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=71.76s)]
*  Especially when it comes to sensitive information, well let's see what Pete Hegseth had to say when he was [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=77.28s)]
*  interviewed yesterday. Let's see if they can even get their story straight here. Here's what Hegseth said yesterday. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=82.48s)]
*  That's my job for the war fighters, for the President of the United States. I look at war plans every single day. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=88.0s)]
*  What was shared over Signal then and now, however you characterize it, was informal, unclassified [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=94.64s)]
*  coordinations for media coordination and other things. That's what I've said from the beginning. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=101.76s)]
*  At the beginning it was left-wing reporters from the Atlantic who got a hold of it and then wanted [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=106.48s)]
*  to create a problem for the President. This is what it's all about, trying to get it President Trump and his agenda. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=111.76s)]
*  Left-wing reporters from the Atlantic who got a hold of it. Y'all included the reporter. You put the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  reporter, the editor-in-chief, in the text thread and then started talking about war plans and then [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=123.68s)]
*  you see Hegseth saying this is just normal informal stuff that we talked about all the time where the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=128.56s)]
*  fighter jets are going to strike. It's absolutely ridiculous. Let's bring in the former deputy [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=133.6s)]
*  press secretary under the Biden administration, Sabrina Singh. Sabrina, I want to get your take on [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=139.04s)]
*  everything first. Let's just start with what I shared there and then you've been in the trenches. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  You've actually seen this stuff and I want to get into that. But first, what's your reaction to what I just showed you? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=150.56s)]
*  Yeah, well thanks for having me on. Look, it's simply shocking and stunning what we're seeing with some of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  these text messages. I mean first, as you know, there was that initial thread started by Mike [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=164.16s)]
*  Walls, the national security advisor, where Pete Hegseth put the entire TikTok of the operation, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=169.44s)]
*  including when the Tomahawk missiles were going to launch, when the F-18s were going to go off and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=175.92s)]
*  launch, when the bombs were going to drop. And then it's now revealed that he put that same timeline, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=181.04s)]
*  which is classified, anything before an operation is completely classified, in a text thread with his [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=186.4s)]
*  wife and brother and personal lawyer. And now it's, you know, a blame game. It's blaming the media, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=192.8s)]
*  it's blaming these former disgruntled employees. And the reality is, is that the media didn't go [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  and type up the schedule of events for a military operation. Pete Hegseth did. These former employees [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  that used to work under Pete Hegseth, that have known him for years and years, didn't type up [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=213.84s)]
*  this classified information and put it into two separate chats. Pete Hegseth did that. So, you know, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=218.64s)]
*  appreciate that there's a lot of spin coming from the White House and the Department of Defense, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=224.55999999999997s)]
*  but the reality is, is there's only one person to blame here who has faced, frankly, no accountability, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=229.2s)]
*  and that is the Secretary of Defense. I mean, look, you were the former Pentagon Deputy Press [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  Secretary, so you have intimate knowledge about how these things work and how they're not supposed [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  to work. When you heard about all of this, like just how unfathomable was it to you based on your [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=247.04s)]
*  protocols, that this is a thing that's happening, that apparently Republican senators and Congress [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=253.44s)]
*  members appear to be okay with it and embracing this as the norm, like just at a human level, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=260.56s)]
*  like what's your reaction after the protocols that you had to follow to keep classified information [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=269.12s)]
*  classified? Yeah, I mean, if this was my former boss, Secretary Lloyd Austin, we would be having [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=274.72s)]
*  a very different conversation today. I mean, Republicans would be launching hearings, they would [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  be blanketing the networks, they would be out on podcasts talking about how, you know, Lloyd Austin [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=287.76000000000005s)]
*  has to resign right now. The reality is, is that no one wants to really go against Donald Trump, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=293.04s)]
*  and you know, from my time at the Pentagon, you know, I was there when we conducted our first [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=299.28s)]
*  operations against the Houthis with partnered, you know, allied nations. You never talk about an [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=305.28s)]
*  operation before it happens, and even when there were social media reports of, you know, bombs being [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=311.84s)]
*  dropped in Yemen and people were showing videos of it, we would not confirm anything until we knew our [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  fighter pilots were back and safe and the operation had concluded. Only then would we release [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=323.68s)]
*  information to the press about, you know, type of aircraft that were used, types of munitions, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  how many targets, how many locations, but all of that before an operation is classified. And, you [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=334.08s)]
*  know, just taking a step back for a minute, Secretary Hegseth is someone that has served our country. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=340.32s)]
*  He was in the National Guard. He has received multiple awards. He talks about his military [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=346.64s)]
*  record all the time. I mean, if you look at his clips back in 2016, he's talking about how he has [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=352.56s)]
*  a secret clearance, a top secret clearance. Whenever you have clearances like that, you are [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=358.4s)]
*  trained, you go through multiple levels of training on how to protect an operation and how to protect [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=363.76s)]
*  classified information. And he literally did the opposite. He not only put all of that information [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=370.0s)]
*  about a military operation before it had happened into two separate unclassified tech threads. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=375.36s)]
*  What he did was he put American fighter pilots at risk. He put our sailors at risk in the Red Sea. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=382.88s)]
*  And that is so dangerous. And truly, if this was any other Secretary of Defense under a [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=388.0s)]
*  Democratic administration, we would be having a very different conversation today. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=393.36s)]
*  Let's talk about that. Let's talk about the dangers of sharing this classified information [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=398.0s)]
*  over unsecured channels like Signal and how in a practical effect that does put our troops and [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=403.44s)]
*  our pilots in danger. What could this do? And from a foreign intelligence perspective, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=409.91999999999996s)]
*  are they looking in at these apps? And are they trying to extract this information? I mean, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=416.88s)]
*  I assume someone like a Hegseth other than Donald Trump is who every foreign intelligence agency is [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=421.84s)]
*  trying to get their hands on his information. Yeah. So every single day, there are cyber hacking [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=427.28s)]
*  groups that are trying to get information on the US government. And the people that they want the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=435.28s)]
*  most information from are the senior levels of the administration. Of course, they're going to [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=440.88s)]
*  try and target people like Donald Trump, JD Vance, but then they're going to look to that national [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=445.2s)]
*  security apparatus, you know, National Security Advisor Mike Wallace, Secretary of Defense Pete [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=450.23999999999995s)]
*  Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio. And they are going to try and use different mechanisms [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=454.48s)]
*  to try and hack into emails, texting apps, you name it. And we know Russia has very sophisticated [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=461.76s)]
*  technology that they actually have been able to permeate into signal messages. We've seen that in [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=468.88s)]
*  Ukraine. And so, you know, when you have all these cyber actors and adversaries trying to get into [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  understanding how our government works, for the Secretary of Defense to take [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  military details about an operation about the mission itself, and move it into an unclassified, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  you know, texting commercial app like you and I have on our phones like signal. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=495.84s)]
*  Just imagine if a cyber hacking group was able to get into that signal thread, and sell that [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=500.8s)]
*  information to the Houthis. So two hours before the attack, the Houthis now have the information [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=508.48s)]
*  of the timeline of when the F-18s are going to launch, when the Tomahawks are going to go, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  and when the bombs are going to drop. And the Houthis are very sophisticated. They would be [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=519.9200000000001s)]
*  able to reposition their air defenses and potentially have been able to shoot down one of our pilots. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=524.48s)]
*  And, you know, we've seen them do that with our aircraft. We've had drones over Yemen, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=530.96s)]
*  and they have been able to shoot them down before. So it's not like this would be out of its world. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=535.6s)]
*  And so the fact that Secretary Hagstaff did that, he put American lives at risk. And he is the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=540.64s)]
*  Secretary of Defense. He is supposed to be looking out for our men and women in uniform, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=545.76s)]
*  and he put their lives at risk by doing that. You know, people hear about the term the dark web, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=550.0s)]
*  or the black market of arm sales. You know, these things exist, right? I mean, like, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=555.12s)]
*  there is a marketplace of people hacking and extracting and instantly selling, and then [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=560.8s)]
*  sending the data to foreign adversaries to use to kill American Air Force pilots, to kill American [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=568.9599999999999s)]
*  troops. And to me, the fact that that exists, and Hagstaff is there in that clip I show, saying that [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=578.3199999999999s)]
*  this is normal, informal stuff. I think to myself, if you're a pilot right now, and you're doing these [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=585.76s)]
*  missions, is this guy doing this all the time? What else is happening? And also, if you're the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=594.3199999999999s)]
*  foreign adversary, you're saying, wow, this is a very vulnerable person. Let's invest more resources [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=600.72s)]
*  there. And so to me, that's why there are these calls when people are saying, this guy's got to go. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=609.28s)]
*  This isn't a partisan Democrat. This guy's got to go. What do you make about those calls for Hagstaff to resign? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=614.64s)]
*  Right. This really shouldn't be a partisan issue. This actually should be a bipartisan issue. There [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=622.08s)]
*  should be calls from both sides of the aisle that this is not someone that was fit for the job. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=627.6s)]
*  And you know, what you alluded to right then and there was, like, the fact that he's using his [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  phones, it's been reported that one was his personal phone that was being used. China, Russia, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=639.04s)]
*  Iran, North Korea, these are all actors that are trying to get into your phones. And your personal [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=644.48s)]
*  phone is not as secure as a government one. And so just the recklessness that the Secretary of [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=649.9200000000001s)]
*  Defense has conducted himself and putting at risk the lives of our pilots, of our sailors [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=657.28s)]
*  in the Middle East. I am heartened to see that Rep. Don Bacon did call for Hagstaff to step down. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=664.88s)]
*  We have seen some calls for an investigation, but it's just not enough. This is really, I think, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=672.96s)]
*  a real rallying moment for Democrats in particular because while we don't hold the lovers of government [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=679.44s)]
*  right now to launch congressional hearings, we do still have a voice. And we have to continue to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=686.08s)]
*  voice our support for our military, for those families that are sending their loved ones overseas [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=693.04s)]
*  conducting very dangerous missions. We are going to have your back and we are going to hold this [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=698.32s)]
*  person accountable who put your son, your daughter, your husband, your wife, at risk. We're going to do [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=704.24s)]
*  that for you. What do you think should happen? What do you want to see happen? You think he should resign? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=710.16s)]
*  I think yes, he should resign, but I also think there should be an investigation. I mean, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=716.08s)]
*  resignation is certainly one thing, but that doesn't actually get to the root of the problem of [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=719.92s)]
*  how did this even happen? How many more text threads are there? What's been compromised? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=727.36s)]
*  It was reported that there might be as much as 20 signal threads that have been started on different [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=733.6s)]
*  operations. That is really problematic, but absolutely. It was the Secretary of Defense, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=739.76s)]
*  it was Pete Hagstaff who was at fault here. He was the one that put that classified information into [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=745.1999999999999s)]
*  the chats, both of them. So he should absolutely resign. You hearing anything from your counter [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=750.24s)]
*  parts in other countries? I mean, a lot of coordination has to take place with our allies, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=756.48s)]
*  right? I mean, our strong allies in Canada and the European Union, in the UK, in Australia, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=762.4s)]
*  and the fact that Donald Trump is treating our adversaries better than our allies and how that [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=769.36s)]
*  impacts the sharing of intelligence and just the overall confidence. Are you hearing things in that [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=776.72s)]
*  area? I've definitely heard concerns. I think all of these text messages and sort of the [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=783.5200000000001s)]
*  conduct of the Secretary of Defense really raises questions for our allies. How can we trust that [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=791.6800000000001s)]
*  the senior most person at the Department of Defense, who's in charge of one of the most lethal [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=797.7600000000001s)]
*  militaries in the world, is going to safeguard our own secrets, is going to safeguard our troops? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=804.6400000000001s)]
*  And if the United States was ever pulled into a conflict or was attacked, we rely on our network [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=810.96s)]
*  of allies. That's actually what makes us strong in the world is because we don't stand alone. We [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=820.48s)]
*  stand together. And so our allies certainly are going to question if they can trust the United [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=824.56s)]
*  States. And not just with Pete Hagstaff, but obviously with Donald Trump and some of the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=831.76s)]
*  actions he's taken and the erraticness of the tariffs. This all feeds into getting to trust [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=835.36s)]
*  with our allies. But to that point, it also sends an incredible message to our adversaries that [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=844.64s)]
*  it shows who's sort of in the room, who has Donald Trump's ear, who's disagreeing with him, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=851.2s)]
*  where the national security apparatus stands when it comes to discussing issues of national security. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=858.4s)]
*  It gives our adversaries an incredible insight into how we think. And you never want to do that. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=864.56s)]
*  You never want to take the element of surprise off the table. And frankly, that's what Pete Hagstaff [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=870.16s)]
*  did. Sabrina, you have a wealth of experience in areas that lots of our viewers know very little [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=873.8399999999999s)]
*  about other than what they see on the Midas Touch Network or they hear about on the news. So when [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=880.16s)]
*  we have someone like you on all this experience, sometimes I just like to ask, is there anything [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=884.4799999999999s)]
*  out there that's not getting enough attention that you think people should be focusing on or [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=888.88s)]
*  that you're focused on and that you just want people to know right now when they have this [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=894.56s)]
*  rare opportunity to hear from you in a forum like this? Yeah, that's a great question. I think one [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=899.84s)]
*  of the things that's certainly being underreported right now is some of the changes that this [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=907.84s)]
*  administration is going to make to our forced posture all around the world. What's being [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=915.28s)]
*  reported is that we're going to downsize our troop presence in Syria. We're going to potentially [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=920.0799999999999s)]
*  close a lot of bases all across the continent of Africa. I have to remind your viewers, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=927.52s)]
*  your listeners that there is still a real threat of ISIS and these terrorist organizations that [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=933.68s)]
*  exist particularly in parts of the Middle East, in Syria and Iraq and throughout Africa. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=939.84s)]
*  They are a threat to our national security and our men and women in uniform and our civilian career [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=946.4s)]
*  folks perform amazing work in combating these threats every single day. If you reduce [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=952.8000000000001s)]
*  the United States presence around the world, if you withdraw from our partners and allies, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=961.12s)]
*  turning our back on Ukraine, I know people think that the America First Agenda just means America [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=969.12s)]
*  alone, but America alone is actually less safe in the world. I think the beauty of the United [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=976.56s)]
*  States is that we always stand and we always go to war or confront any conflict around the world [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=984.3199999999999s)]
*  with our friends. That's what makes us strong and frankly that's what always tips the scales in our [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1S7857G07c&t=991.4399999999999s)]
