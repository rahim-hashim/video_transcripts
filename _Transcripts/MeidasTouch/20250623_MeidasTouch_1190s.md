# Fox News COLLAPSES on LIVE TV as Trump WAR BACKFIRES
**MeidasTouch:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs)
*  State regime media known as Fox is in a total and utter collapse as its [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=0.0s)]
*  Propaganda trying to act like Donald Trump's strikes against Iran were some [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=6.2s)]
*  Massive victory it is backfiring and Fox's face and they just don't know what to do [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=11.88s)]
*  So they tried a number of tactics yesterday [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=17.3s)]
*  so first they bring on Marco Rubio and Marco Rubio the Secretary of State tries to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=20.38s)]
*  Pretend that America is not at war with Iran because Donald Trump attacking Iran is [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=27.04s)]
*  incredibly unpopular [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=33.92s)]
*  So here's Marco Rubio he goes on Maria Bartiroma and he goes no, we're not at war with Iran [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=35.68s)]
*  We're just focusing on the nuclear program. That's about it here play this clip. Mr. Secretary. Thank you for being here [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  Are we now at war with Iran? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  No, we're not this is not a war against Iran. This is this is very simple, you know 67 days ago [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=51.959999999999994s)]
*  The president United States sent the Iranians a letter and it said you're not going to have nuclear weapons [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=59.44s)]
*  You're not going to have a militarized nuclear program. Let's negotiate. I want to do this diplomatically [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=63.44s)]
*  I want to do this peacefully they played they tried to play them along the way [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=68.72s)]
*  They've played every American president for the last 35 years and you know [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=72.24s)]
*  The president told them if we don't get a deal that which is what he wanted then I'll have to handle it differently [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=76.44s)]
*  But you see then Donald Trump contradicts what you just saw right there and Donald Trump posts [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=81.48s)]
*  It's not politically correct to use the term regime change [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  But if the current Iranian regime is unable to make Iran great again [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=90.4s)]
*  Why wouldn't there be regime change make Iran great again? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=95.28s)]
*  Exclamation point exclamation point so then Fox has to pivot so then you have Kayleigh McEnany on Fox [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=100.28s)]
*  Who's Donald Trump's former press secretary and now she says? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  Every dictator is on notice right now. So now they're expanding their regime change [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  Operation to include all dictators around the world America is going to go to war with everybody [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  Well that escalated quick here play this clip [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=124.12s)]
*  Precisely every dictator in the world is on notice now [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=128.64s)]
*  Now one of the things that we're learning as well is that the fordo [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=132.28s)]
*  Nuclear complex was not completely destroyed and Donald Trump on Saturday said it was [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=137.88s)]
*  completely destroyed and Trump says that the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=145.16s)]
*  Entire nuclear operation of Iran has been knocked out destroyed forever. They are done [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  So now it's time we just move on and Trump's like who we talk about the budget bill [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=155.16s)]
*  He see doesn't really work that way Donald and in fact with all of the data coming out [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  It seems that the nuclear facility was not completely destroyed at all that the uranium was able to be [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=164.16s)]
*  moved and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  Also that Iran had warned Donald Trump that they would potentially activate terrorist cells [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=173.68s)]
*  Across the world or potentially in the United States as a result of Trump's conduct [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=180.76s)]
*  So now I want to show you what Fox is doing. They are preemptively [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  Blaming former president Biden for potential terrorist attacks in the United States [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=190.76s)]
*  caused by Donald Trump teaming up with Netanyahu and no other [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=197.32s)]
*  Allies of the United States and attacking Iran seriously Bill Mulligan of Fox is saying per senior [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=202.16s)]
*  CBP sources here were all of the Iranian nationals that crossed during Biden and let go [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  We don't know if they're terrorists, but there may be Biden Iranian terrorists out there [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=214.84s)]
*  Do you see what they're doing? But now that the Midas Touch Network and independent media is out there calling them out [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=220.04s)]
*  Educating the American people what's going on? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=229.04s)]
*  Swatting down their propaganda tactics Fox doesn't know what to do. So they try their usual tricks [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=231.88s)]
*  They bring on this guest who's like to the Iranian people. I say yallah to the Iranian people [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=238.12s)]
*  Yallah now go and overthrow the ayatollah here play this clip [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=244.12s)]
*  And to the Iranian people I say yallah go go take your country back [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=248.64s)]
*  The world is watching and we all stand with you. Yallah [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=254.4s)]
*  That's a word. I've I've learned from you Aaron Cohen. Thank you very much [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=258.36s)]
*  World we just be real for a second. Like I think the ayatollah is a terrible person [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=263.52s)]
*  Okay, I don't want to see the ayatollah running Iran. I don't think that Iran should have nuclear weapons [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=269.88s)]
*  I don't want though the United States to be in a never-ending Middle East war based on false [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  Pretext the same way we did in Iraq in 2003 [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  This is like that on steroids and on fast forwards times about 10x and let me tell you I just have a hunch [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  Here that even if the ayatollah is unpopular amongst a lot of Iranian people [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=295.04s)]
*  I'm gonna guess that Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump are more unpopular and I don't think the Iranian people are going to welcome a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=300.88s)]
*  Just come on regime change us in Iran. And why don't you put a Netanyahu and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=309.88s)]
*  Trump puppet, I'm sure that will go real. Well utterly I'm being [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=315.52s)]
*  Pasecious, of course, then you have this next guest here [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=320.96s)]
*  Who goes on Fox and now they try to kind of push their propaganda into overdrive [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=325.28s)]
*  And they go we are so blessed [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=330.44s)]
*  We are so lucky to have Pete Hegseth and Donald J Trump [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=333.16s)]
*  Running the operation unlike the people who are running California and Los Angeles [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=338.88s)]
*  He talks like that too. You're playing this clip. I think it's reassuring that in the face of this situation [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=344.76s)]
*  We've got really strong leadership in the federal administration [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=350.88s)]
*  Whether that's the Department of Justice FBI, of course, Pete Hegseth there and the president [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=355.12s)]
*  That's reassuring. It's not reassuring [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=360.52s)]
*  Frankly when you have states like California cities like Los Angeles led by people with no moral clarity on these questions [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=362.92s)]
*  And no real operational competence when it comes to law and order in any sense. Look, okay [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=370.36s)]
*  So so then you have Mark Levin [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=376.24s)]
*  Mark Levin is like the biggest warmonger is like let me tell you how we know [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=379.96s)]
*  It's my mark Levin impression. So Mark Levin then spends the entire night [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=384.6s)]
*  Let me tell you I'm mark Levin and here's what you need to know [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=389.72s)]
*  Donald Trump is just like Netanyahu. Now I want you to watch this clip because Mark Levin [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=393.68s)]
*  Essentially says that Trump and Netanyahu are so similar to one another and such good friends [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=401.16s)]
*  Because they're both criminals here play this clip alliance between our two countries [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=408.04s)]
*  Let me tell you a little story quickly Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are friends [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=413.6s)]
*  They have many of the same [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=419.76000000000005s)]
*  friends and enemies [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=422.56s)]
*  Look in our country our government tried to take out Donald Trump the establishment tried to take him out [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=424.8s)]
*  They use phony crimes. They use phony civil statutes. They brought him in Democrat districts. They had judges [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=430.76000000000005s)]
*  I would say in their back pocket ideologically. Yes, and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=437.68s)]
*  Yet he muscled through and he defeated them and you defeated them too with your with your vote this election [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=441.8s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu is something similar going on. He's been in a criminal trial over the most inane [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=448.76s)]
*  allegations one could ever imagine and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=455.32s)]
*  It goes on and on and on with a hard left attorney general a hard left [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=458.52s)]
*  Prosecutorial system and radical leftist judges including on their Supreme Court [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=464.47999999999996s)]
*  They have basically what is a judicial tyranny at the highest level [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=469.12s)]
*  We have a judicial tyranny at the lowest level but sort of leeching into the highest level [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=472.96s)]
*  So they share the same in many respects [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=477.08s)]
*  enemies obstacles and friends [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=480.59999999999997s)]
*  And so they're very close despite all the leaks that you read in Axios and Politico [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=482.84s)]
*  They were pushed out there a gap between Netanyahu and Trump a gap between the the Americans and the Israel [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=488.0s)]
*  So you ever wake up and feel like your body just hit the snooze button on life [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFtWh2AxNDs&t=494.03999999999996s)]
