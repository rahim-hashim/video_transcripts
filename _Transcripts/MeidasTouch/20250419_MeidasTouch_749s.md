# PISSED OFF Michigan Voters UNLEASH HELL on Trump
**MeidasTouch:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8)
*  As Donald Trump and Elon Musk have unleashed their wrecking ball in the United States of America, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=0.0s)]
*  Michigan has been impacted significantly and it's notable because Michigan flipped back in the 2024 [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=6.88s)]
*  election to vote for Trump. There were obviously red flags during the election like when Trump would [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=14.72s)]
*  go to Michigan and have fake union workers at fake union shops pretend to be union workers. I don't [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=20.8s)]
*  know that may have been a red flag but now you have real Michigan auto workers and union workers [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=27.84s)]
*  who are saying look you're playing poker with people's lives. This from a recent Guardian [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=35.04s)]
*  piece residents in the auto industry's heartland are responding to the chaotic start to Trump's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=41.04s)]
*  signature economic policy. I think we've seen Donald Trump's polling when it comes to his [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  handling of the economy right now lower than it even was during COVID. That's supposed to be [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=52.8s)]
*  the strong issue I guess for the Republicans although I never knew why that was viewed as a [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=58.56s)]
*  strong issue for Republicans. There's other issues in Michigan that need to be highlighted as well [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=63.36s)]
*  like this 70 international students facing deportation in Michigan and the Trump regime [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=70.32s)]
*  refuses to say why the ACLU is challenging the Trump regime's decision to revoke international [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=76.96s)]
*  students legal status representatives from the various universities are saying they're not given [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  any reasons why and it's harming their universities cohesiveness and ability to function. Stories like [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  this a lab that helps forecast severe weather in Michigan is crippled by Trump staffing cuts [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  essential functions at the federal Great Lakes research lab that monitors toxic algae blooms [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=102.8s)]
*  and helps forecast Michigan weather have been crippled by the Trump regime's wave of federal [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=108.72s)]
*  firings of 30,000 federal workers in Michigan. We're seeing resistance as well MSU faculty [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  joining calls for a big 10 mutual defense compact with other universities to stand up and we're just [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=121.52s)]
*  hearing tragic individual stories you know like this I mean and this story is repeated over and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=128.64s)]
*  over again a Michigan car repair shop owner detailing how the Trump tariffs are impacting [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=133.6s)]
*  his business let's play it. These tariffs affect your day-to-day operations I mean is charging more [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=139.04s)]
*  the only solution? That's the problem you know you can only pass so much onto a customer you know [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  as a mechanic our labor rates are a little bit high because cars are more complicated to work on [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=151.44s)]
*  to diagnose so we try to help a customer by getting parts at a discount now with these 25% [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=157.92s)]
*  going up it's not much we can help and we're scared that customers will put off their repairs [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  hopefully not too long but we just don't know what's going to happen. You have the tariff threat to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  business and then you have the fact that the Trump regime is disappearing people off the streets and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=177.6s)]
*  sending them to essentially extermination camps in El Salvador here on WWMT TV a West Michigan business [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=182.08s)]
*  owner talks about the impact on his various businesses and how the Trump immigration attacks [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=189.36s)]
*  are devastating to Michigan play. Vladimir Judy owns a few different businesses here in Coldwater [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=195.84s)]
*  he tells me many of his workers came to the U.S. legally under programs created by former president [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden's administration he says that many of these workers are deported under Trump [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=207.36s)]
*  administration policies it would be a disaster for his businesses. I think it's a big mistake [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=212.24s)]
*  and there is a lot of mistake together that he's doing right now and I think it's going to be [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=219.28s)]
*  catastrophic. Vladimir Judy says he believes migrants are a big force driving America's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=226.72000000000003s)]
*  economy he tells me like so many others he came to the U.S. from Haiti for a better life with more [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=232.48s)]
*  opportunities. At first he was going to deport the criminals but since I didn't find enough [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=237.83999999999997s)]
*  criminals to stay busy so now he's going after the good ones. Judy says so far none of his workers [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=243.44s)]
*  have been deported but it's a major concern because of recent attempts to deport some migrants [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=248.64s)]
*  legally in the U.S. that includes the deportation of a Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=253.27999999999997s)]
*  Salvador the Trump administration claims Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang despite providing [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=259.04s)]
*  no evidence. Based on the sensationalism of many of the people in this room you would think we [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=264.88s)]
*  deported a candidate for father of the year. President Trump is also trying to undo some [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=269.92s)]
*  immigration programs which allow migrants to work in the U.S. as for Judy he has a message for [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=274.72s)]
*  migrant workers in West Michigan. I think it's a privilege that we have in the United States [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  that we have people coming from all over the world to come here and work and contribute to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=287.52s)]
*  the American dream. Be proud of yourself know your worth stay strong. Know your worth stay strong. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  Let's bring in Dr. Abdul El-Sayed. Doctor you're running as the Democratic candidate one of the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=300.88s)]
*  Democratic candidates for the Senate race there. Senator Bernie Sanders just endorsed you a big [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=307.28s)]
*  endorsement right there you just recently announced your candidacy. When you see those [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=314.24s)]
*  videos you're on the ground in Michigan you previously were the director of the largest [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=319.2s)]
*  health department in the state of Michigan where you were focusing on doing things like giving [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=324.32s)]
*  kids free eyeglasses and helping people. So what do you make of the situation right now in the state? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=329.44s)]
*  You know Ben I'll tell you there is so much pain and I trained as a doctor and the thing you're [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  trained to do is to walk in and see pain and ask two foundational questions what's wrong and how [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=341.28s)]
*  can I help? And the thing about it is that oftentimes when people see you when they're in pain [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=348.55999999999995s)]
*  it's already set into a kind of cynicism. What Trump's one neat trick is is he's able to take [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=354.23999999999995s)]
*  that pain and then really really drive the cynicism so that he puts people like him and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=359.84s)]
*  Elon Musk in power and then they just make it worse because of course they never really had [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=365.67999999999995s)]
*  any solutions and you think about that message from that business owner my neighbor in here in [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=370.08s)]
*  Michigan and we all have to know our worth. We all have sources of pain in fact I would argue that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=375.2s)]
*  the reason Trump ever got elected is because there is so much of it but the question of pain is can we [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=381.84s)]
*  actually work together and turn it into hope? Can we believe that things can actually get better? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=386.56s)]
*  What Trump did on immigration if I may for a second because my parents immigrated to this country [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=391.91999999999996s)]
*  what he did was he made us think that it was somebody else who was causing us all this pain [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  and then he demagogued the whole idea of immigration itself to destroy people's lives. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=400.56s)]
*  I don't think anybody wants their lives destroyed or the lives of their neighbors destroyed what [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=405.52s)]
*  they really want is to know that the economy works for people like them not Musk and Trump. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=409.12s)]
*  They really want to know that they can go see a doctor without taking on crippling medical debt. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  They really want to know that their kid goes to a school that's going to train them for the future [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  that they hope will be better than the one that they had and so that's just failing to see the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=422.24s)]
*  challenge in front of folks and turning it into or turning ourselves against one another. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=428.72s)]
*  You know I saw Senator Sanders rally in Michigan and then he was in Wisconsin and then he went to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=434.08s)]
*  lots of ruby red states he went to Utah he was in Idaho then red areas in blue states. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=441.44s)]
*  Lots of people showing up and he's talking about issues that hit home to people education [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=448.88s)]
*  health care you know the things that are are at the center of their lives so do you see hope [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=455.67999999999995s)]
*  though right now do you see change because Michigan went in the opposite direction in the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=462.56s)]
*  2024 election? Yeah I happen to be one of the speakers at that rally in Warren. I mean when I [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=467.12s)]
*  tell you what 10 000 people in a high school looks like it's kind of wild but the reason [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=473.12s)]
*  that they came out to listen to Senator Sanders is because he's been talking about these issues for [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=478.16s)]
*  a very long time and anybody who knows anything about the senator is that he is unafraid to say [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=483.04s)]
*  what's wrong to call it out clearly and to propose real solutions and you think about the kind of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  enthusiasm that that's generating it should remind us that the bar is not really so high even though [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=494.48s)]
*  I think a lot of politicians get themselves round around the axle and the reason why is because [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=500.64000000000004s)]
*  we're told that the way to win an election in a place like Michigan is to triangulate to the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=505.12s)]
*  least common denominator position on an issue and then make sure it's fundamentally inoffensive to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=509.68s)]
*  anybody but that then means that if you're thinking about the corporation whose pack check you want [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=515.52s)]
*  you end up saying nothing at all but then you say with enthusiasm because some consultant told you [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=520.4s)]
*  that you've got to really say it but when you say nothing at all with enthusiasm you'll look [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=523.92s)]
*  ridiculous and so what what what what Bernie is showing us is that if you were actually willing [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=527.68s)]
*  to surface the conversations people are having with their loved ones across the dinner table or [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=532.64s)]
*  the anxieties that they have when they look their kids in the eye and speak directly to those that [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=536.88s)]
*  folks want to come out for that so I'm so grateful for his endorsement for what he's been doing in [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=541.28s)]
*  our politics and I'm hoping that here in Michigan we can take that take that pain and surface it into [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=545.52s)]
*  into real solutions that we can actually turn into public policy and start making people's lives [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=551.28s)]
*  better that to me is where the hope is. You know you said something earlier in the interview about [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  how Trump almost tries to normalize the suffering and make people feel they're not worth anything [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=562.8000000000001s)]
*  and when people feel so beaten down with no hope that's when authoritarianism can really fester [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=569.9200000000001s)]
*  and prey on people's just lack of rising up and caring about these issues so as as you look forward [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=576.72s)]
*  though to your campaign what's your message right now to to to Michigan what what's going to set you [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=584.4s)]
*  apart from the other Democratic candidates to restore that sense of hope and why ultimately [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=590.9599999999999s)]
*  do you think you're the right person to go against the Republican candidate who seems to be Mike [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=596.4s)]
*  Rogers uh uh MAGA Republican? Yeah well number one it just shouldn't be this hard to get by [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=601.76s)]
*  in the richest most powerful country in the world and the people who have exploited that pain [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=608.24s)]
*  they're just making it worse so we need somebody who's going to do two things number one you've [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=615.12s)]
*  got to step up and fight back I got receipts on on my role as a fighter and I don't back down [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=619.1999999999999s)]
*  but it's not just about fighting back you got to know what you're going to fight for and the thing [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=624.3199999999999s)]
*  about me is I'm not afraid to tell you what I think the world ought to look like to give you a [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  vision for what my leadership would mean in hard public policy I wrote the book on Medicare for All [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=633.28s)]
*  I know that corporations the fortune 500 have literally corrupted our politics for their profits [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=639.8399999999999s)]
*  against the kinds of opportunities that we need and deserve I'm fighting for an economy where one [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=646.4s)]
*  job is enough to feed a family where it's the best possible place to start a small business [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylYHTGmEL8&t=652.0799999999999s)]
