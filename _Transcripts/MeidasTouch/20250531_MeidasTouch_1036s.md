# YIKES! Fox News in PANIC MODE over Trump’s DISASTER
**MeidasTouch:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8)
*  Let's talk about state regime media known as Fox being in an utter panic mode right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=0.0s)]
*  You had Laura Ingraham bringing on a right-wing editor from Breitbart, and they're trying to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  understand what the hell Donald Trump was talking about when he went to the U.S. Steel factory, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=12.56s)]
*  and what the hell these MAGA Republicans are claiming about this deal where Nippon Steel [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=17.52s)]
*  from Japan is going to be acquiring U.S. Steel. And Laura Ingraham's like, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=23.28s)]
*  do you know the terms of this? Because I don't really know the terms of this deal. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=27.84s)]
*  And then the way they try to frame it like, well, we should know the terms because imagine if, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=31.44s)]
*  like, it's okay now that Trump's the only person that knows, but like, what if you have [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=36.24s)]
*  Buttigieg and Harris? Then we're going to be in real trouble. Play this clip. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  Well, the president fights for American workers first. The president fights for American [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=46.24s)]
*  companies first. This was quite a rally in Pittsburgh. We haven't seen a Trump rally [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  of this sort in a long while. Here to break it all down, Alex Marlowe, Breitbart Editor-in-Chief, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=56.56s)]
*  host of the Alex Marlowe Show. Alex, this is being described as a partnership, this deal between [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=61.68s)]
*  Nippon and U.S. Steel, but then it's described as an acquisition on the U.S. Steel website, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  and then it's described as a partnership, and President Trump said he will be watching over [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=77.44s)]
*  things as things proceed, as this deal goes forward. Have you seen any of the terms of this [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=82.56s)]
*  deal thus far? Like, who owns the majority stake in this company? Laura, this is exactly where I was [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=89.12s)]
*  hoping you would start because I'm reading all these different things. I'm trying to get deal [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=96.4s)]
*  details and I'm hearing it's an investment. Okay, that sounds terrific. And here's a partnership, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=100.0s)]
*  thinking, wait a minute. And then you think about it, U.S. Steel has been, had, the Nippon Steel's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=104.64s)]
*  had its eye on U.S. Steel trying to buy it for 18 months, and we cannot have U.S. Steel owned by a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=110.32s)]
*  foreign company. Even a great country like Japan should not be owning any part of U.S. major [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=116.08s)]
*  manufacturing. I mean, that is a major national security risk, and I've not seen the deal detailed. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  The rally was sensational. I completely trust Donald Trump, and I trust the current Japanese [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=126.32s)]
*  government to do something good, but we have to insulate ourselves, Laura, in case we have a bad [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=131.04s)]
*  president one day. So any deal, when we see these terms, it needs to be Pete Buttigieg-proof. It [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=135.44s)]
*  needs to be Kamala Harris-proof. I mean, so utterly ridiculous. Where is the deal? What's the agreement? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=140.32s)]
*  What we do know is that starting in 2023 and 2024, the deal was an acquisition of Nippon Steel, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=147.2s)]
*  acquiring U.S. Steel, which on a bipartisan basis, politicians said was dangerous and harmful and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  should be blocked. Trump said he was going to block it. So why don't we get to see the deal [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=161.04s)]
*  right now? Let's see it. Let's ask him. Is it an acquisition? This shouldn't be complicated stuff. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=165.04s)]
*  Then you have this MAGA Republican Congress member Dan Mauser on Laura Ingraham, and he says, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  actually, it's more of just like an investment, but really U.S. Steel is going to be in control. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=178.0s)]
*  And even Laura Ingraham couldn't just let him get away with that. Here, play this clip. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=182.88s)]
*  Mellon University. Congressman, I don't blame you. I think you're doing what you should do for your [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=187.44s)]
*  district. I don't have any doubt about that. But President Trump campaigned against a deal that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=193.76s)]
*  would end up with ultimately 51% control of a critical industry like steel in the hands of a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=201.84s)]
*  foreign entity. Now you're saying we don't see the terms of the deal. I always want the lawyers, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=209.6s)]
*  so I want to see the deal. I don't know why they're hiding the terms of the deal. I haven't seen [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=214.4s)]
*  the deal. Have you actually seen the terms of the deal? No, I have seen where CFIUS is on it and how [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=217.52s)]
*  those national security concerns can be mitigated. And I also know that the president has reviewed [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=224.88s)]
*  it as has, I believe, Scott Bessent, Howard Lutnick and others. But it's still being structured, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=230.24s)]
*  Laura. Well, so it needs to be highly satisfactory. Congressman. Yeah, but it's I don't mean to be, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=237.52s)]
*  I'm not trying to be difficult, but it's still being structured. So, but we have heard repeatedly [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=242.88s)]
*  that this is a partnership on the US Steel website. It says it's a good thing. Basically, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=248.48s)]
*  I'm paraphrasing that we are being acquired by Nippon. So next up you have Jesse Waters [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=254.4s)]
*  saying that, Oh, everybody's saying that Trump chickened out. Trump's not a chicken. Play this [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  clip. I'm just kidding, Jessica. I pay attention when you talk. I'm a little annoyed about the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=267.28s)]
*  taco thing because they're saying Trump chickened out. Newsome went to China and was seduced like a [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=272.96s)]
*  woman. Remember they threw him in a toboggan and took him to a zoo and he was like grinning like [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  a little kid. Swalwell's compromised by the Chinese. I mean, this is a very delicate dance [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  we're doing. We just did war games with the Philippines. We just did a missile deal with [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=291.52s)]
*  Japan. We're kicking all of their students out of the country. We have a 30% tariff. They only [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=296.48s)]
*  have a 10% tariff. We're about to raise tariffs on their pharmaceuticals. No one's chickening out. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  Okay. Just let the process play out. You panicants. And then he makes his next attack at Democrats. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=306.72s)]
*  They have this weird logo, toxic Democrats. And then how like building and maintaining human [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=314.16s)]
*  civilization is serious. I don't even know what they're talking about here. Play this clip. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=320.48s)]
*  Building and maintaining human civilization's serious business. We can lose this country like [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=324.16s)]
*  that. The Roman Empire, the British Empire. Here one day, gone the next. Now let me show you how [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  Fox tries to literally censor and filter and sanewash Donald Trump. So here's what they were [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  showing in the morning. Like Donald Trump issued a statement. First, let me show you visually what [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=344.24s)]
*  the statement looks like just so you can see. So guys pull up what the visual statement looks like [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  from Johnny Maga's post. You see it right here where Donald Trump goes, the US international [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=354.0s)]
*  courts incredibly ruled against the United States. Wah, wah, wah. It's purely a hatred of Trump. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=359.04s)]
*  What other reason could it be? Then he goes on to attack the Federalist Society. I was new to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=365.36s)]
*  Washington and it was suggested I use the Federalist Society as a recommended source of judges. I did so [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=370.72s)]
*  openly and freely but then realized that they were under the thumb of a real sleazebag named [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=376.96s)]
*  Leonard Leo, a bad person who in his own way probably hates America. He goes on, I don't want [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=381.92s)]
*  to read you, it's so whiny and blabbering, to attack the Federalist Society, to attack Leonard [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=387.12s)]
*  Leo. But I'll show you the portion that Fox shows. This is like literally sanewashing for the guy [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=393.68s)]
*  playing this clip. And the president reacting to the ruling against his tariff agenda on Truth [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=398.48s)]
*  Social saying this, quote, where do these initial three judges come from? How is it possible for them [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=403.36s)]
*  to have potentially done such damage to the United States of America? Is it purely a hatred [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=409.36s)]
*  of Trump? What other reason could it be? He continued, the ruling by the US court of international [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=415.04s)]
*  trade is so wrong and so political, hopefully the Supreme Court will reverse this horrible, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=420.64s)]
*  country-threatening decision quickly and decisively. And by the way, under Donald Trump's own terms, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=426.48s)]
*  shouldn't there be a $20 billion lawsuit against Fox for that? Didn't they just edit? Didn't [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=434.08s)]
*  Donald Trump say that when 60 Minutes did like a slight edit to one of the things that Kamala Harris [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=439.76s)]
*  said, that that caused Donald Trump severe emotional distress and that that's why he should [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=448.88s)]
*  be paid $20 billion? How pathetic. What a snowflake. Next you have Kevin O'Leary going on the Fox and [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=454.24s)]
*  Friends morning show and he tries to plead with Donald Trump. He's Canadian, by the way, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=461.2s)]
*  and not but he's a Canadian who wants Canada to be sold to the United States. Ridiculous, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=466.8s)]
*  horrific stuff. Vichy, Vichy stuff right there. And he goes, he goes, why would we want to take [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=473.76s)]
*  our best and brightest students and send them out of the United States? Like, why are we expelling [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=480.48s)]
*  foreign students? Play this clip. Yeah, obviously the lightning rod right now is Harvard and I must [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=486.32s)]
*  disclose I teach there as an executive fellow. I will say one thing though, in all of this debate, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=491.52s)]
*  they curate remarkable students from all around the world. They don't care their religion or [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=496.8s)]
*  geography or race. They just try and find the top 900 they can find and they never cared. And then [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=501.2s)]
*  I met them myself, 37% of the class I'm teaching is from foreign countries. They don't want to [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=507.76s)]
*  leave America. They don't hate America. They want to get a passport, stay here and start a business. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=513.6s)]
*  And I think I'm one of the lone voices pointing that out. Why would we want to take the bright [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=518.64s)]
*  brightest and smartest people on earth and kick them out of the country after we spend millions [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  teaching them? It seems stupid to me. Yeah. And they, these guys are smart. These men or women [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=526.88s)]
*  are the very best of the very best of the very best that made the cut. Now, Harvard's taken a [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=532.16s)]
*  lot of heat for other stuff, but they shouldn't be taking heat for curating amazing cohorts. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=537.0400000000001s)]
*  These kids are amazing and we gotta keep them here. Oh, thank you. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=541.36s)]
*  They've always had it about you. I'm like, Harvard is desperate for you to come back. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=548.4s)]
*  So do you know the world's richest source of vitamin C isn't an orange? It's the Kakadu plum [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=552.88s)]
*  from Australia. It's got over a hundred times more vitamin C than your average orange, but I'm [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=557.52s)]
*  not foraging in the outback. And let's be honest, I'm probably not eating enough fruit every day. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=562.48s)]
*  That's why I trust Aurora NutriScience's liposomal vitamin C to cover my bases. It's [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=567.84s)]
*  convenient. It's powerful. And because it uses liposomal technology, it actually gets absorbed [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=573.44s)]
*  up to 90% compared to traditional pills or powders. Vitamin C is essential, not just for your [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=579.44s)]
*  immune system, but also for collagen production, energy, and recovery from stress. Aurora's formula [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=586.0s)]
*  comes in these travel-ready liquid packets that you could rip open and sip. You could keep them [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=592.1600000000001s)]
*  in your pocket, purse, or fridge, and enjoy them chilled or at room temp. They're non-GMO, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=596.88s)]
*  gluten-free, made with organic fruit flavors, and taste surprisingly great. And the best part, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=602.56s)]
*  one packet gives you as much vitamin C as 15 regular tablets without the stomach upset that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=608.48s)]
*  usually comes with high doses. I've started taking it daily to keep myself healthy and my family, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeZWHZdmNG8&t=614.64s)]
