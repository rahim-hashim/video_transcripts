# Mexico Prez DESTROYS Trump after TOMATO THREATS
**MeidasTouch:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA)
*  She's back, Donald. Mexico's very popular president, Claudia Scheinbaum, holding more press conferences where she kind of very politely just shoes Donald Trump off. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=0.0s)]
*  And she's like, you know, this Trump regime, they have a way of speaking. They're kind of just fools. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=14.5s)]
*  Okay, Donald, you want to try to now do tariffs against our tomatoes? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=21.0s)]
*  Okay, then that just means that Americans are going to pay 21% more for their tomatoes. They're still going to buy our tomatoes, Donald. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=27.0s)]
*  This is after Trump's latest gambit after losing, losing, and losing more. He's going to tariff the tomatoes that Mexico sends to the United States. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=34.5s)]
*  Mexico's the biggest supplier of tomatoes. And let me be clear, while it's very, very, very important that we here in the United States are supporting [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=46.0s)]
*  first and foremost our American tomato farmers, there has to be some part of broader plan so that Americans who are already suffering because of Donald Trump's failed policies are not quite literally paying 21% more for things based on Trump's recklessness. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=55.0s)]
*  So here's what President Claudia Scheinbaum of Mexico said, where she was like, they have a way of talking about things. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=73.0s)]
*  This these these people in America just like just basically calling them clowns. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=81.0s)]
*  No offense to real clowns, which is a real profession. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=86.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is a fascist clown. Play this clip. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=89.0s)]
*  Now, let's see. They have their as I have always said, they have their way of communicating what we have always said and will always uphold. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=92.0s)]
*  It is our principle, our conviction. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=101.0s)]
*  And moreover, how it should be to protect the nation and the people of Mexico is that there is coordination. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=104.0s)]
*  There is collaboration. Information is shared, but without subordination and with respect for our sovereignty. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=112.0s)]
*  That is always mentioned. So that is the level of coordination of collaboration that exists. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=119.0s)]
*  And well, there is a security cabinet that is working every day, every day and also addressing the causes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=126.0s)]
*  And there is a reduction in crimes and the reduction will continue. It will continue. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=135.0s)]
*  Now, here's President Claudia Scheinbaum talking about tomatoes and she has one of her top officials by her side. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=140.0s)]
*  And you can see they're viewing the Trump regime as like a like an oddity, like, OK, we've seen this before. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=148.0s)]
*  Here play this clip about the tomato. It's important to know this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=156.0s)]
*  The Florida producers in tomatoes have accused without reason that Mexican producers sell their tomatoes in the United States below cost, which is not true. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=161.0s)]
*  So there is this suspension agreement on dumping until yesterday when the United States withdrew from this agreement until July 14th, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=171.0s)]
*  when it will already begin the application of this measure for the alleged tricks we have done with twenty point ninety one percent. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=179.0s)]
*  The Mexican government was not notified. Lawyers for the tomato producers in the United States were notified. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=187.0s)]
*  That is bad. The amount of tomato exported to the United States cannot be replaced by any other in the world because also the tomato is picked fresh and delivered fresh. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=197.0s)]
*  But in the case that it even arrived, if this sanction were applied, in any case, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=208.0s)]
*  Mexican tomatoes would continue to be exported to the United States because they have no substitute. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=213.0s)]
*  The main problem would be that tomatoes would be more expensive in the United States. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=219.0s)]
*  If they want to do it, then they will simply pay twenty one percent more for their tomatoes. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=224.0s)]
*  This process has been done many times and Mexico has always won. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=230.0s)]
*  Because, folks, we have seen this before. They know the playbook. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=237.0s)]
*  The world knows that Trump is a con artist, a vile, despicable piece of trash who's a very weak cornered rat. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=242.0s)]
*  Again, no offense to cornered rats who are of far more dignity than Donald Trump. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=251.0s)]
*  Like this is Donald Trump during his first campaign. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=256.0s)]
*  Remember when he said, we're going to make Mexico pay for it here. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=261.0s)]
*  Play this clip. Who's going to pay for the wall? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=265.0s)]
*  Who? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=269.0s)]
*  A hundred percent, a hundred percent. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=274.0s)]
*  You know, as I played you that clip, what I was having a discussion with someone yesterday where I was like, you know, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=278.0s)]
*  there's so much that I detest and despise and loathe about Trump's evil policies. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=285.0s)]
*  I said, but one of the things, too, that I just can't get over is this guy's behavior. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=291.0s)]
*  Like, it's not normal. Like you saw that clip of him from the campaign. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=297.0s)]
*  Like that's not how adult human beings in leadership positions should behave. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=301.0s)]
*  If people who you worked with acted like that, you would be like, what the heck is going on? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=307.0s)]
*  This person is some serious problems like you can trash Trump's behavior to President Claudia Scheinbaum. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=312.0s)]
*  She's dignified. Right. She speaks deliberately. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=320.0s)]
*  She she's a leader and Trump's Mexico, Mexico, Mexico. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=325.0s)]
*  That's why when she goes, oh, they speak of this is how they speak there. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=329.0s)]
*  Like he's Kim Jong Un basically. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=335.0s)]
*  By the way, here's a montage of Donald Trump making the promise that Mexico is going to pay for the wall in the first term, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=337.0s)]
*  which never happened. Play this clip. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=343.0s)]
*  Who pays for that wall. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=345.0s)]
*  Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico's Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=347.0s)]
*  Mexico's Mexico. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=358.0s)]
*  Mexico's a Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=359.0s)]
*  Can you imagine, Sean, he's saying Mexico is going to pay. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=364.0s)]
*  They'll never pay. And I'm saying that's like 100 percent. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=367.32s)]
*  That's not like 98 percent, Sean. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=371.08s)]
*  It's 100 percent they're going to pay. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=373.56s)]
*  Who's going to pay for the wall? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=375.44s)]
*  Are you looking for something simple and delicious to add to your wellness routine? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=378.88s)]
*  I used to rely on regular honey for my breakfast tea and even salad dressings. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=382.48s)]
*  But then I found Manicura. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=386.08s)]
*  And let me tell you, it puts all other honey to shame. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=387.48s)]
*  Manicura honey is rich, creamy and the most delicious honey I've ever had. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=390.56s)]
*  The best part, it's ethically produced by master beekeepers in the remote forests [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  of New Zealand. These bees collect nectar from the Manuka tea tree, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=398.96s)]
*  which is packed with bioactives, giving Manicura three times more antioxidants [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=402.4s)]
*  and prebiotics than your average honey. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=406.96s)]
*  Each morning, I start my day with a heaped teaspoon of Manicura, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=409.12s)]
*  letting the creamy texture melt in my mouth and coat my throat. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=412.28s)]
*  And it's not just a treat, it's packed with powerful nutrients to support [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  my immunity and gut health. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  And here's something that sets Manicura apart. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=420.0s)]
*  It contains a special antibacterial compound called MGO, which comes from the Manuka [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=422.12s)]
*  tea tree. Manicura tests every harvest for MGO. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=427.79999999999995s)]
*  And you can see the results yourself through their QR system. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=431.24s)]
*  It's a honey with superpowers. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=434.52s)]
*  Whether you're adding it to your food or enjoying it straight off the spoon, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=436.76s)]
*  it's a game changer. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=440.03999999999996s)]
*  Now it's easier than ever to try Manicura honey. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=441.4s)]
*  Just head to Manicura.com. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=444.44s)]
*  That's M-E-I-D-A-S to get twenty five dollars off the starter kit, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  which includes an MGO 850 plus Manuka honey jar, five honey travel sticks, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=451.67999999999995s)]
*  a wooden spoon and a guidebook. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=457.44s)]
*  That's Manicura.com. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=459.88s)]
*  For twenty five dollars off your starter kit. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=462.08s)]
*  Start your mornings with Manicura. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=465.64s)]
*  You'll never go back to ordinary honey. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=467.64s)]
*  Now, contrast that to Claudia Scheinbaum. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=469.96s)]
*  Again, these clips I'm showing you are from this week. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=472.32s)]
*  We AI the voice because I want to make sure that our English speaking viewers can [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  hear it too, so I apologize to our Spanish speaking audience. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=480.0s)]
*  It's probably like, why are you doing AI voice? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=483.36s)]
*  But it captures it pretty well, the translation. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=485.88s)]
*  So here she is and she's asked about being one of Time magazine's kind of people [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=488.36s)]
*  of the year right now, one of the most powerful people that Time magazine said. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=494.4s)]
*  And watch how she handles it versus how Trump handles it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=498.76s)]
*  And you notice that in how she responds, she's taking a subtle jab at Donald. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=502.0s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=507.56s)]
*  Good morning. How are you? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=508.44s)]
*  It was just published by Times magazine that you are among the one hundred most [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=510.68s)]
*  influential people in the world. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=515.6s)]
*  Some people get dazzled by these things and say, wow, but no, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=517.4s)]
*  you must always keep your feet on the ground. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=523.96s)]
*  If one does work, that is up to the standards of the people of Mexico, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=526.32s)]
*  because the people of Mexico are the best there is, as it is thanks to this bond we [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=530.6s)]
*  have with our movement, with history and with the people, not to betray and to be [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=536.56s)]
*  honest, always, let's say that these recognitions more than to myself are to [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=543.12s)]
*  the people of Mexico. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=548.9599999999999s)]
*  How would you like history to remember you? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=549.88s)]
*  The National Development Plan has already been published. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=553.28s)]
*  It includes the one hundred commitments we made in the Zocalo of Mexico City. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=556.56s)]
*  And we are going to fulfill all one hundred. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=560.52s)]
*  So from our principles, honesty, integrity above all, up to each of the topics we [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=563.0799999999999s)]
*  committed to. So there are one hundred commitments. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=571.64s)]
*  And in the fourth transformation, commitments are fulfilled. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=580.9599999999999s)]
*  And then here's this clip of Claudia Scheinbaum that I think is very powerful [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=582.16s)]
*  as well, where she's convened an international coalition, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=585.8s)]
*  a Latin American coalition rather, about sovereignty, respecting sovereignty, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=592.64s)]
*  not subjugating Latin American countries. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=598.4399999999999s)]
*  And she's bringing the countries together. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=601.4s)]
*  And the theme here, and this is a direct strike at America, sovereignty, sovereignty, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=603.3599999999999s)]
*  sovereignty, you do not cross that line of sovereignty. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  You understand, Donald? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=611.76s)]
*  And she's rallying Latin America to behind this. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=612.8399999999999s)]
*  Sovereignty here play this clip. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=615.48s)]
*  Hello, I come on behalf of a generous and supportive people. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=617.76s)]
*  Today, after 15 years since the first meeting of this community, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=624.0s)]
*  it is a good moment to acknowledge that Latin America and the Caribbean need unity [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=628.28s)]
*  and solidarity from their governments from Mexico. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=633.96s)]
*  We start with a basic premise. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=637.6s)]
*  A more united region is a stronger region. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=639.8000000000001s)]
*  For a second day, I have a proposal for you. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=643.0s)]
*  I invite select to convene a summit for the economic well-being of Latin America [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=647.0s)]
*  and the Caribbean to make a greater regional economic integration, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=652.3599999999999s)]
*  a reality based on shared prosperity and respect for our sovereignty. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=657.7199999999999s)]
*  No country in Latin America and the Caribbean should be left behind. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=663.92s)]
*  I cannot fail to mention the need to cooperate in addressing human mobility [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=669.76s)]
*  from a perspective humanist. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=675.28s)]
*  We reject racism, classism, the violation of human rights and the criminalization [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=678.0799999999999s)]
*  of our continent's brothers and sisters who for some reason have needed to migrate [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=686.0s)]
*  to the north. For us, Mexican migrants are heroes and heroines. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=691.68s)]
*  We reject sanctions and trade blockades that only harm the well-being of the people [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=698.2800000000001s)]
*  and do not build regions of peace and prosperity. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=705.72s)]
*  No to the blockade against Cuba. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=709.84s)]
*  No to the blockade against Venezuela. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=712.76s)]
*  Our foreign policy is characterized by the pursuit of peace and dialogue. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=715.5200000000001s)]
*  As the first woman president of Mexico, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=720.5600000000001s)]
*  I share with you that in Mexico we have learned that in the face of adversity, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=723.4000000000001s)]
*  there is always hope. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=728.8000000000001s)]
*  And today, hope is unity. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=730.48s)]
*  Long live Latin America and the Caribbean. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=733.1600000000001s)]
*  Speaking of sovereignty and dignity and all of these things, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=736.96s)]
*  I want to leave you with this thought right here. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=740.2s)]
*  I want to remind you of this headline from this week that you may have not even [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=742.76s)]
*  known took place or may have just kind of crossed the newswire, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=747.5600000000001s)]
*  but you didn't hear about it because normally a United States president would [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=752.4s)]
*  talk about it. This is from ABC. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=756.16s)]
*  It talks about two service members. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=758.32s)]
*  The United States were killed near the US-Mexico border in a vehicle accident, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=761.04s)]
*  and a third service member involved in the accident remains in critical condition. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=767.2s)]
*  Let me read it for you, because our hearts, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=772.6s)]
*  I wish more could be more than my hearts and my thoughts. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=775.24s)]
*  I wish I could do something more than that. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=777.5600000000001s)]
*  But any their families, what they're going through, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=778.88s)]
*  I can't even imagine in my heart and my sympathy. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=783.28s)]
*  And everything goes to those families in this tragic death. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=786.6s)]
*  Here's what happened. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=790.56s)]
*  Two service members were killed and another is in serious condition following [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=791.68s)]
*  a vehicle accident earlier Tuesday in Santa Teresa, New Mexico. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=795.64s)]
*  The United States Northern Command said in a statement shortly before 9 a.m., [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=799.2s)]
*  three service members deployed in support of a joint task force. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=803.2s)]
*  Southern border were involved in a vehicle accident, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=806.6s)]
*  Northcom said. Tuesday's accidents are the first fatalities associated with the [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=809.4s)]
*  United States military's mission along the border with Mexico that had been [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=813.92s)]
*  disclosed. More than 10,000 active duty service [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=818.04s)]
*  members have been authorized for the border mission. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=820.84s)]
*  The cause of the accident is under investigation, officials said. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=823.1999999999999s)]
*  So think about that. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=827.4s)]
*  Donald Trump has not posted about it. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=829.24s)]
*  He's not given a speech where he's mentioned it. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=832.0s)]
*  He says all of these deranged things, he attacks a brego Garcia, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=834.8s)]
*  the mega Republicans go in front of the concentration camp jails and they do [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=839.28s)]
*  thumbs up. Have you heard him once acknowledge this [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=844.64s)]
*  the same way Donald Trump refused to acknowledge the American soldiers who died [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=848.3199999999999s)]
*  in Lithuania, Lithuania acknowledged that Donald Trump doesn't. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=852.76s)]
*  Why? Because Donald Trump thinks that our [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=856.76s)]
*  veterans and people who die in combat or people who die in the military or injured [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=859.04s)]
*  are suckers and losers. That's what Trump thinks about him. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=863.2s)]
*  Why else would he not, again, express sympathy for people who died, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=866.72s)]
*  who are all who are deployed because of his war on the border with Mexico? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=872.0s)]
*  Anyway, I thought it was important that I bring that up. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtQavesItA&t=879.0400000000001s)]
