# Trump’s TERRIBLE SECRETS from Past COVERED UP by FBI?!!
**MeidasTouch:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds)
*  Donald Trump's head of FBI is Cash Patel, and the number two is Dan Bongino. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=0.0s)]
*  These are both right-wing nutjobs who had these bizarro podcasts where they spread lies [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=6.46s)]
*  and dangerous conspiracies, but they gave a sit-down interview, both of them together. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Oh, by the way, didn't they attack former Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Walz for doing a sit-down interview together, like two of them? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=24.8s)]
*  Whatever, there's nothing really consistent with these magazines. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=28.48s)]
*  Anyway, you had Bongino and Patel doing a sit-down interview together, and here's what [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=30.76s)]
*  they were asked by Fox's Maria Bartiroma. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=36.72s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=40.2s)]
*  You said Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=41.2s)]
*  People don't believe it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=45.06s)]
*  Well, I mean, listen, they have a right to their opinion, but as someone who has worked [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=46.06s)]
*  as a public defender, as a prosecutor who's been in that prison system, who's been in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  the Metropolitan Detention Center, who's been in segregated housing, you know a suicide [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=55.08s)]
*  when you see one, and that's what that was. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=60.0s)]
*  He killed himself. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=62.92s)]
*  Again, you want me to... [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=63.92s)]
*  I've seen the whole file. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=66.36s)]
*  He killed himself. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=67.78s)]
*  Which is very interesting for their response because who were some of the big purveyors [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=68.78s)]
*  of the conspiracies regarding Epstein? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=73.84s)]
*  Oh, may I show you Exhibit A, what Donald Trump said to Tucker Carlson? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=76.4s)]
*  But possibly he didn't do that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=81.08s)]
*  Do you think it's possible that Epstein was killed? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=82.08s)]
*  Oh, sure, it's possible. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=83.84s)]
*  I don't really believe... [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=85.92s)]
*  I think he probably committed suicide. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=86.92s)]
*  He had a life with beautiful homes and beautiful everything, and all of a sudden he's incarcerated [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=89.76s)]
*  and not doing very well. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=97.12s)]
*  I would say that he did, but are those people? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=99.32s)]
*  There are many people. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=103.72s)]
*  I think you're one of them, right? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=104.72s)]
*  But a lot of people think that he was killed. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=105.72s)]
*  He knew a lot on a lot of people. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=108.86s)]
*  He was killed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  You think so? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  May I show you Exhibit B, Dan Bongino on his podcast before going from right-wing nut job [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  podcaster to deputy FBI director? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=120.24s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=124.16s)]
*  I'm telling you there could be some national security problems here because ladies and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=125.83999999999999s)]
*  gentlemen, nobody knows how much material people have on Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=132.32s)]
*  Who was videoed where, where those videos are. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=139.0s)]
*  I was told by someone a long time ago, a very knowledgeable reporter, and it's not my information. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=143.44s)]
*  I'm not hiding. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=147.64s)]
*  I mean, oh, you're hiding up for some foreign government. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=148.64s)]
*  You're protecting... [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=150.8s)]
*  I'm not protecting anyone. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=151.8s)]
*  I'm only telling you what I was told. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=152.94s)]
*  That some governments around the world may have some material that's related to the Epstein [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=156.1s)]
*  thing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=163.36s)]
*  Bill Clinton was knee deep in this, man. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=164.36s)]
*  I have a very, very good source. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=167.76s)]
*  I've told you this story. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=170.08s)]
*  Forgive me for repeating it if you're a P1, but some people are new here and never heard [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=171.68s)]
*  this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=175.92s)]
*  He was on the plane with Bill Clinton and Epstein on one of Epstein's planes when Bill [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=176.92s)]
*  Clinton was on the plane with some women who, according to my source, looked underage. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=183.56s)]
*  Why was my source on the plane? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=191.3s)]
*  Dan, you know people who hung out with Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=194.36s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=197.64s)]
*  He was working. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=199.76s)]
*  Now folks, we've been reporting on this over and over again on the Midas Touch Network [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=202.0s)]
*  that Donald Trump's Department of Justice is covering up the Epstein files. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  We believe this is the case because Donald Trump was close friends with Epstein and Epstein [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=210.7s)]
*  would traffic girls who worked at Mar-a-Lago like Virginia Joufray who now died by suicide [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=214.94s)]
*  under suspicious circumstances in Australia as well. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  Let's go over the facts quickly. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  I've done a lot of other videos on this, but let me tick off the facts quickly. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=226.84s)]
*  Trump is DOE 174 in some of the Epstein files that have not been released. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=230.56s)]
*  That's how he was identified. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=235.88s)]
*  So release the files about DOE 174 and Donald Trump's relationship with Epstein. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=237.12s)]
*  We know that Donald Trump's already said that Epstein's a great guy who likes girls on the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=241.6s)]
*  younger side. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=245.6s)]
*  I think he said he likes women on the younger side is the exact quote from Donald Trump. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=246.6s)]
*  We know Epstein trafficked girls from Mar-a-Lago through Ghislaine Maxwell. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=250.12s)]
*  We know Donald Trump, to which Ghislaine Maxwell well at her sex trafficking trial. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=256.02s)]
*  Donald Trump's name appears at least seven times on the Epstein flight log that was released [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=260.65999999999997s)]
*  already a few years back, but that was only a small portion of the flight log. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=265.78s)]
*  We know that Epstein traveled on Trump's jet and brought girls who were of indeterminate [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=270.14s)]
*  age is how one witness described it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=275.21999999999997s)]
*  We know that Donald Trump is in Epstein's call list of people he called and all of Donald [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=277.58s)]
*  Trump's numbers from security to personal, lots of Trump contacts, different addresses. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=282.86s)]
*  We know that Donald Trump's name appears all over these Epstein depositions where Epstein [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=290.90000000000003s)]
*  would bring women he were trafficking or girls he would traffic to Trump hotels and Trump [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=295.62s)]
*  properties. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=300.66s)]
*  Those are the facts. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  We know that the White House already tried to cover it up by claiming they were releasing [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=303.78000000000003s)]
*  the Epstein files and they had these right-wing influencers hold up these binders that said [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=307.06s)]
*  Epstein files and they weren't actually the files. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=312.12s)]
*  They were the call list that was redacted. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  Pam Bondi said that she was going to release these files, that she had a truckload of files [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=317.2s)]
*  and she's hoping this just goes away and that people forget about it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  Here at the Midas Touch Network, I know that corporate news doesn't talk about it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=326.0s)]
*  We talk about it here. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=329.36s)]
*  I think it's important to know Donald Trump's connections with Epstein because we know a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=330.64s)]
*  lot of the public ones already. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=334.32s)]
*  Here's what they're saying on right-wing podcasts though now for several months. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=336.59999999999997s)]
*  They're accusing the FBI of destroying and deleting Epstein files. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  This is a right-wing podcast called the Benny Johnson Show. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=344.36s)]
*  Maybe he'll be a future FBI director or Homeland Security secretary. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=351.96s)]
*  Listen to what his witness says here. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=352.96s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=353.96s)]
*  Somebody's worked very hard to make sure that this data that you're talking about can be [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=354.96s)]
*  deleted and destroyed forever. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=358.0s)]
*  Any idea what it is? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=359.88s)]
*  No idea on what it is. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=361.32s)]
*  I can only speculate, but you mentioned the Epstein list. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=362.32s)]
*  I'd imagine it's cases like that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=364.91999999999996s)]
*  It's intel cases that are very siloed, very secretive. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=367.64s)]
*  And I'm sure there's probably even information regarding the FBI's own subversive measures. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=371.44s)]
*  And we here at the Midas Touch Network got the exclusive with Democratic Congress member [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  Dan Goldman, who wrote a formal letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi demanding that [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=380.24s)]
*  she provide responses if she's covering up for Donald Trump. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=385.84s)]
*  Is she redacting Donald Trump's name? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=389.76s)]
*  Is she having the FBI and DOJ officials destroy and shred the Epstein files that contain [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=392.2s)]
*  Donald Trump's name on it? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  So you may know this about me, but I'm a new father. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=399.52s)]
*  And with everything that's going on in the world, if I wasn't already in protect my family [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=402.36s)]
*  mode, I'm particularly so with all the uncertainty taking place right now. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=408.12s)]
*  So look, I'm focused on life insurance. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  So I don't just protect my family now, but I protect them in the future. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=414.68s)]
*  And so for me, when I go think about life insurance, I want to make sure that I'm getting [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=419.02s)]
*  the best. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=424.18s)]
*  That's why I go to Select Quote. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=425.18s)]
*  Select Quote is one of America's leading insurance brokers with nearly 40 years of experience, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=427.26s)]
*  helping over 2 million customers find over several hundred billions of dollars in coverage [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=432.7s)]
*  since 1985, which is the year I was born. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=438.09999999999997s)]

*  Here's what Congressmember Goldman told me when he sent his letter last week to the DOJ [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=493.53999999999996s)]
*  saying, what the hell's happening to these files? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=498.21999999999997s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=500.21999999999997s)]
*  And so there was a mad dash and a big rush to release everything and everyone was talking [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=501.21999999999997s)]
*  about it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=505.82s)]
*  And now there's radio silence. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=506.82s)]
*  And the begs the question, why has the attorney general gone dark on this? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=509.34000000000003s)]
*  Why has Congresswoman Luna and others stopped calling for it? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=516.54s)]
*  What is it that's in the Epstein files that they were so eager to have that now are just [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=521.54s)]
*  not being released according to the attorney general's promises of transparency, but are [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=529.26s)]
*  still there. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=537.06s)]
*  And there's no explanation. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=538.3399999999999s)]
*  And the concern I have, of course, is we know Donald Trump had a friendship with Jeffrey [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=540.9s)]
*  Epstein. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=547.0999999999999s)]
*  We know Jeffrey Epstein had numerous numbers for Donald Trump. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=548.0999999999999s)]
*  And the question then is, was this some sort of directive from Donald Trump or someone [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=552.26s)]
*  on his staff or an agent of his to the attorney general to kill this? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=557.66s)]
*  And that would be yet another pretty egregious act of corruption using his position as president [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=563.8199999999999s)]
*  for his own personal benefit. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=572.66s)]
*  It is incumbent upon the Republicans currently in the majority to do their damn job, do their [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=574.54s)]
*  job and conduct oversight over the president of the United States. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=579.8199999999999s)]
*  Stop sucking up to him so much. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=584.86s)]
*  Now, you go back to March 4th, 2025, where Bondi said that she had truckloads of evidence [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=586.5s)]
*  on her desk. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=591.38s)]
*  Then before that, they claimed it was going to be released. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=592.9799999999999s)]
*  And then they had that fake release event at the White House where the influencers very [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=595.4599999999999s)]
*  just grotesquely were holding up the binder and celebrating it. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=601.3s)]
*  I had Michael Wolff, who had interviewed Epstein before on the Midas Touch podcast. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=606.2199999999999s)]
*  I interviewed Michael Wolff. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=612.38s)]
*  No corporate media would interview Michael Wolff other than me because they didn't want [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=613.62s)]
*  to get into these subjects. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=617.58s)]
*  And Trump had basically told the media, do not have Michael Wolff on. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=618.94s)]
*  That didn't scare us. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=623.1s)]
*  And Michael Wolff said that Epstein believed that he was like Trump's best friend, not [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=624.1s)]
*  just like close, like best friends here playing this clip. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=629.02s)]
*  And he sat for many, many hours of discussion with me. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=631.62s)]
*  I mean, certainly, certainly 80, 90, probably 100 hours I have of Epstein on tape. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=637.78s)]
*  And one of the discussions, because this was occurring, Trump became the president in 2017. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=646.22s)]
*  I began writing about Trump. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=655.62s)]
*  And so we spent a lot of time talking about Donald Trump and Epstein's relationship with [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=659.7s)]
*  Trump, which was went on for a good certainly 15 years and was incredibly close. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=666.3s)]
*  They were each other's closest friend for a very long time. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=672.78s)]
*  And Epstein, I think Epstein is one of those people who truly knew Donald Trump, knew many [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=679.9799999999999s)]
*  secrets about Donald Trump and was threatening to Donald Trump. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=688.4599999999999s)]
*  You know, and I think when you see them partying together, they were best friends. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=694.82s)]
*  I mean, here I'm a lawyer, so I go by evidence. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=698.26s)]
*  Here's Trump and Epstein partying together. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=701.1s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=702.98s)]
*  I'm going to get great ratings on your show. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=703.98s)]
*  Trump is surrounded by women as music flares in the background. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=705.98s)]
*  After a while, Trump goes to greet three new guests, among them, the financier Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=710.1800000000001s)]
*  Come on in, go inside. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=717.1800000000001s)]
*  More than a decade before his guilty plea on state prostitution charges. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=718.58s)]
*  Later in the footage, Trump is seen talking to Epstein and another man as women are dancing [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=723.26s)]
*  in front of them. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=728.46s)]
*  Trump alternates between dancing and pointing out women to Epstein and the other man and [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=729.7s)]
*  telling Epstein about the cameras. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=734.8199999999999s)]
*  Though exactly what they say is difficult to understand as they discuss the women and [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=738.7s)]
*  their appearances, Trump gestures to one and appears to say to Epstein, look at her back [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=743.46s)]
*  there, she's hot. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=749.86s)]
*  And then Trump says something else into Epstein's ear that makes him double over with laughter. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=753.9s)]
*  But as the president says now, he never liked Epstein. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=761.02s)]
*  So I think the cover-up is deepening there. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=765.58s)]
*  You see for yourself the behavior and I'll let you decide what's going on there. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmZ6TyEyds&t=767.98s)]
