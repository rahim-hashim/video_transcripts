# Trump LOSES IT as his Entire World CRUMBLES FAST
**MeidasTouch:** [May 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk)
*  Hey, hey, ho ho, Elon Muskets got to go. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=0.0s)]
*  The protests are not going away, Donald. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=11.82s)]
*  The protests are not going away, Elon. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=14.16s)]
*  That was a protest in front of a Tesla store in Boston. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=16.56s)]
*  Shout out to the peaceful protesters there. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=19.84s)]
*  You saw a saluting Elon joining the Tesla takedown protesters there. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=22.88s)]
*  Thank you to Descent Pins for posting that. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=28.4s)]
*  Meanwhile at Mar-a-Lago, they're partying. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=31.479999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump was golfing again. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=34.44s)]
*  He wrecks the economy, destroys our lives. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=36.48s)]
*  Then they party at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=39.12s)]
*  The oligarchs and their spouses taking selfie photos, laughing at the American people who [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=41.32s)]
*  are suffering as Donald Trump lies and claims that he solved inflation and claims that egg [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  prices are down and gas prices are down and everybody's doing amazing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=52.76s)]
*  Donald Trump says, when we the people know that's not the case, Donald Trump's destroyed [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=57.12s)]
*  our economy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=62.0s)]
*  He's destroyed our alliances abroad. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=63.0s)]
*  He's destroyed the very brand that was the United States of America. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  Here they are, look, RNC chair Michael Watley and co-chair Casey Crosby at a spring gala [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=70.6s)]
*  at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=77.16s)]
*  Not only is Donald Trump spending our taxpayer dollars to golf again this weekend and to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=78.96s)]
*  bring all of his staff and where he houses them at Mar-a-Lago that we the taxpayers pay [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=85.12s)]
*  for, but they're doing the RNC gala so Donald Trump can make more money and grift even more. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=90.68s)]
*  I previously reported this, but it bears mentioning again that Donald Trump and his regime are [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  now preparing a military parade in June on his birthday. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=101.64s)]
*  Seven thousand troops, tanks, parachute jumps, 50 helicopters, airplanes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  It'll cost around a hundred million dollars at least so Donald Trump can look like North [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=111.2s)]
*  Korea's Kim Jong-un in a military parade in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  It is so utterly embarrassing right now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=121.2s)]
*  Let me remind you of five things alone that Donald Trump did this week. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=124.0s)]
*  One, he blamed Biden for the stock market tanking. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=127.76s)]
*  Two, he called for criminal investigations of pollsters over his low approval ratings. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=130.72s)]
*  Three, he claimed gas prices are under two dollars a gallon. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=135.72s)]
*  Four, he was a no-show at the White House on Friday and ran cartoons of himself instead [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=139.68s)]
*  of the press briefing that he said that was going to take place. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  And then he went golfing. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=149.56s)]
*  I could add six, seven, eight, nine, ten very easily. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=150.92s)]
*  Donald Trump posting AI images of himself dressed as the Pope right after Pope Francis's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=153.88s)]
*  funeral giving the middle finger to the Catholic community. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=160.4s)]
*  And whether you're Catholic or not, whether you're even religious or not, this is the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=164.24s)]
*  height of being disrespectful, mocking the Catholic religion. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=167.7s)]
*  Could you imagine if former President Biden ever did anything like this? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=171.7s)]
*  The New York State Catholic Conference put out a statement just before. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=176.45999999999998s)]
*  They said, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=180.26s)]
*  There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr. President. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=181.26s)]
*  We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the Cardinals are about to enter a solemn [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=184.92s)]
*  conclave to elect a new successor of Saint Peter. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=190.14s)]
*  Do not mock us, Donald. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=194.14s)]
*  A powerful statement from the Catholic Conference of New York. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=197.17999999999998s)]
*  And I've been seeing a lot of other statements like that from the Catholic community and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=200.42s)]
*  others who aren't even religious or Catholic. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  We reported on this before, but again, I want to reiterate it here. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=207.82s)]
*  A big election victory for the Labor Party in Australia, which is their left center party [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  in Australia. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=218.22s)]
*  Anthony Albanese there, the prime minister, will go on to secure another three year term. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=219.42s)]
*  Their right wing party in Australia, which is called the Liberal Party, led by Timu Trump, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=225.61999999999998s)]
*  a guy by the name of Peter Dutton, got obliterated. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=230.42s)]
*  It was embarrassing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  It's showing the entire world that if you stand with Trump, you will fall for everything. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=236.26s)]
*  You will fall in the elections and you will get embarrassed the way Pierre Poliev of Canada [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=241.11999999999998s)]
*  lost his riding. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=246.14s)]
*  Peter Dutton not only lost the election for the Liberal Party in Australia, again, which [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=248.3s)]
*  is their right wing conservative party, he lost his own seat as well. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=253.06s)]
*  It was the worst election day pretty much in the history of that Liberal right wing [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  party in Australia. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=262.06s)]
*  And folks, here's why too. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=265.14s)]
*  I mean, take a look at what the Trump regime is doing internationally. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  You have Secretary Marco Rubio making the following statement, attacking Germany. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=271.18s)]
*  We have the United States Secretary of State attacking Germany. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=277.3s)]
*  And he goes, Germany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=281.54s)]
*  That's not democracy. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=287.90000000000003s)]
*  It's tyranny in disguise. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=288.90000000000003s)]
*  What is truly extremist is not the popular AFD, which took second in the recent election, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=290.6s)]
*  but rather the establishment's deadly open border immigration policies that the AFD opposes. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=296.54s)]
*  Germany should reverse course. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=302.66s)]
*  Shut the F up. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=303.98s)]
*  Secretary Marco Rubio, you despicable, you know what? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=305.94s)]
*  You don't need to interfere in German elections. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=311.21999999999997s)]
*  The AFD is a far right extremist party that many have called neo-Nazi. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=313.8s)]
*  A far right extremist party. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=319.34s)]
*  The German Foreign Office has to respond and teach democracy to Secretary Marco Rubio from [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=321.54s)]
*  the despicable Trump regime. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=328.34s)]
*  The German Foreign Office writes, this is democracy, you idiot. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=330.6s)]
*  They didn't say you idiot. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=334.26s)]
*  They said this is democracy. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=335.74s)]
*  This decision is the result of a thorough and independent investigation to protect our [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=337.7s)]
*  Constitution and the rule of law. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  It is independent courts that will have the final say. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=345.08s)]
*  We have learned from our history that right-wing extremism needs to be stopped. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=348.12s)]
*  Marco Rubio. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=353.86s)]
*  Michael Cohen, not the Michael Cohen on the Midas Touch Network writes, nothing to see [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=355.98s)]
*  Secretary of State advocating for an anti-Semitic, anti-Islamist right-wing German political [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=361.94s)]
*  party and then getting posterized by the German Foreign Office social media manager. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=367.26s)]
*  And folks, I get asked this question a lot here, which is how do I do research on the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=374.22s)]
*  Midas Touch Network? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=379.38s)]
*  What are the tools that I use? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=380.65999999999997s)]
*  I use a tool called Ground News. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=382.18s)]
*  At ground.news.mtn is where you should go. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=385.14s)]
*  I use a feature called Blind Spot because I want to be informed. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=389.5s)]
*  What's the right-wing talking about? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=394.46s)]
*  What's the left-wing talking about? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=396.18s)]
*  I want to come with receipts and facts here when I do these hot takes each and every day. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=397.7s)]
*  So I use Ground News. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=403.74s)]
*  It keeps me informed. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=405.65999999999997s)]
*  I use their Blind Spot feature. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=407.34s)]
*  And if you want to do the type of research I do, I suggest you check it out. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=409.5s)]
*  Go to ground.news.mtn or scan the QR code. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=413.58s)]

*  Ground News is subscriber-funded, so they don't rely on ads. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=424.9s)]
*  That could also introduce biased subscribing supports, our channel, and their independent [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=427.65999999999997s)]
*  team working to keep media transparent. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=432.18s)]

*  Because I wonder, is this getting coverage on the right wing or are they just trying [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=441.38s)]
*  to cover it up as well? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=446.02s)]
*  That a air traffic controller in the Newark airport has told CNN it's not safe. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=448.62s)]
*  It's not a safe situation right now for the flying public. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=456.06s)]
*  Do not fly into Newark. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=460.97999999999996s)]
*  Avoid Newark at all costs. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=463.53999999999996s)]
*  A direct quote from an air traffic controller saying U.S. airspace is now unsafe in the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  Trump regime. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=471.94s)]
*  We've gone five days going on six of major delays at Newark with FAA citing staffing [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=473.38s)]
*  levels because Elon Musk and Doge fired all of the FAA air traffic controllers. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=479.62s)]
*  They gutted the agency. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqlkGg4vQRk&t=485.78s)]
