# Trump gets INSTANT KARMA as TERRIBLE NEWS Drops
**MeidasTouch:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw)
*  This is nightmare news for Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=0.0s)]
*  The American people are waking up and the American people view Donald Trump's age as [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=3.0s)]
*  a major factor for his inability to even think straight right now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=9.02s)]
*  Finally, we're seeing polls that reflect the reality. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=14.52s)]
*  Like this YouGov poll, is Trump's age affecting his presidency? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=17.56s)]
*  57% of respondents say yes. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=22.76s)]
*  Only 31% of respondents say no. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=26.16s)]
*  Donald Trump's cognitive abilities, Donald Trump's just deranged behavior like making [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  posts saying that former President Biden was executed in 2020 and a robotic manifestation [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=37.72s)]
*  of him is currently in existence. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=45.94s)]
*  And that's the Biden that we see right now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=49.44s)]
*  American people are taking notice, which tells me our message is breaking through and also [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=52.24s)]
*  so much so that the New York Times is actually covering this stuff. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=57.260000000000005s)]
*  It's why it's important that we here in independent media take control of narratives because we [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=62.52s)]
*  can push legacy and corporate news to focus on the issues that actually matter to Americans. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=68.08s)]
*  This was on page one of the New York Times. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  Trump amplifies outlandish robot Biden conspiracy theory. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=78.28s)]
*  Trump reposted a user's false claim that the former president had been executed in 2020 [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=83.76s)]
*  and replaced by a robotic clone. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=90.22s)]
*  And when we call out Donald Trump's deranged and demented behavior, we have to close the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=93.6s)]
*  loop, not just call out the behavior and then move on to the next topic, but we have to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=99.16s)]
*  connect it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=104.32s)]
*  How is this impacting the American people? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=105.76s)]
*  And we see with Donald Trump's reckless behavior and malicious behavior as it relates to tariffing [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=108.58s)]
*  the world and how that has backfired, as it relates to Donald Trump and Elon Musk ripping [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=115.48s)]
*  apart and destroying our federal government in a hostile takeover, as it relates to how [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=122.56s)]
*  Donald Trump has handled foreign policy in such a pathetic and weak manner that's made [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=128.6s)]
*  us far less safe. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=134.56s)]
*  As we look at Donald Trump taking away Medicaid and attacking Medicare and Social Security [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=136.32000000000002s)]
*  and food stamps and all these other essential services and programs that Americans rely [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=141.94s)]
*  on, we have to connect it to the fact that this is a demented individual. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  Under former President Biden, we had a very stable, predictable, values-based, orderly [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  system. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  I disagree with certain policies of former President Biden, but you never feared that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=160.92s)]
*  you were going to wake up and he was going to make a social media post that would apply [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=165.92s)]
*  tariffs against countries that would then have a massive economic impact without going [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=171.06s)]
*  through Congress. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=177.88s)]
*  You never had to wake up with former President Biden and wonder, oh, is he going to extort [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=179.11999999999998s)]
*  Ukraine today or is he going to say that he wants to turn Gaza into Trump Gaza? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  You never had to do that with former President Biden. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=190.4s)]
*  You knew where he stood and the data speaks for itself. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=193.12s)]
*  We were the fastest growing GDP in the world. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  16.2 million jobs were created, record low unemployment, 40,000 infrastructure projects, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=199.76s)]
*  lowering the cost of prescription drug prices. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=207.32s)]
*  With all of the flooding the zone of what Trump and Maggot does, I just want you to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=210.24s)]
*  think about something. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  Isn't it three weeks ago or so where Donald Trump said that he was reducing prescription [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  drug prices by 80 to 90% via an executive order? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=221.48s)]
*  Well, that hasn't happened, has it? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=227.04s)]
*  Remember when Donald Trump said he was going to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=229.48s)]
*  That hasn't happened. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=233.82s)]
*  But what we are seeing happening across the world as it relates to the international safeguards, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=234.82s)]
*  we're seeing countries standing up to Donald Trump, taking the power for themselves and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=242.4s)]
*  isolating Trump. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=247.84s)]
*  I mean, we covered it yesterday, but it bears repeating again that President Zelensky of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=248.84s)]
*  Ukraine had a incredibly successful operation in Russia, deep in Russia, where he destroyed [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=254.24s)]
*  30 to 40% of the strategic air force of the Russian military. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=262.52s)]
*  41 airplanes belonging to the Russians were destroyed, billions of damages for the Russians. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=269.32s)]
*  This was a coordinated drone strike by Ukraine where they brought these drones deep into [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=275.92s)]
*  Russian territory and they were able to kind of automatically let the drones go up. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=282.74s)]
*  They got their Ukraine assets out and this caused severe devastation within the Russian [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=289.78s)]
*  military, creating a safety for we the people throughout the free world. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=295.56s)]
*  I'm talking about other polls though, as it relates to Donald Trump. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=302.4s)]
*  If you take a look at the Atlas Intel poll on favorability, this tells a big picture [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=305.76s)]
*  right here. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=311.8s)]
*  Former President Obama is plus 10 net favorability, AOC plus four net favorability. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=312.96s)]
*  Donald Trump negative 11 favorability, JD Vance negative 14 favorability. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=321.76s)]
*  So for all the media tries to do to attack AOC and Bernie Sanders or former President [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=329.36s)]
*  Obama and others who are speaking to the people, remember the data does not reflect that that's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=336.28s)]
*  where the people stand. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=343.88s)]
*  The people stand with AOC and Bernie Sanders and former President Obama and not with taco, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=344.96s)]
*  not with Donald Trump taco. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  You also hear all of these media narratives trying to attack the Democratic Party over [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=355.08s)]
*  and over again. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  The Democratic Party's lost, they've lost their way. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=361.47999999999996s)]
*  What do they stand for? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=364.24s)]
*  If you've been watching the special elections taking place across the country at the congressional [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=366.32s)]
*  level, at the state level, state Senate seats and state House seats, mayor seats, judgeships, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=372.08s)]
*  Democrats have been winning and winning big and overperforming significant amounts of [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  what Trump did in those very same districts. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=387.56s)]
*  If you look at Atlas Intel, their latest polling data and they were the most accurate pollsters [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=390.12s)]
*  in the 2024 election in a generic House of Representatives poll, Democrats are at 51% [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=395.48s)]
*  and Republicans are at 42%. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=403.12s)]
*  I think that Democrats can increase that number even more as the Republicans push through [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=406.44s)]
*  the disastrous budget bill. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=412.34000000000003s)]
*  And I think if Democrats can do what AOC and Bernie Sanders and some others are doing, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=415.12s)]
*  speaking directly to the people about the values and principles of the Democratic Party [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=420.24s)]
*  and how they're going to fight and actually deliver, I think that that's going to go a [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=424.72s)]
*  long way. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=428.56s)]
*  It's so interesting right now to watch Elon Musk try to distance himself from the devastation [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=430.68s)]
*  that he caused our great nation, how he caused hundreds of thousands if not millions of people [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=439.04s)]
*  to die based on what he's done with USAID and his destruction of the federal government. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  And so I was glad to see this CBS reporter and it would have been journalistic malpractice [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=453.6s)]
*  if the CBS reporter didn't ask Musk this question. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=460.72s)]
*  Talk to us about what you've been doing with respect to the devastation that you've caused [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=465.32000000000005s)]
*  in the government and talk to us about tariffs. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=472.0s)]
*  And you'll see Elon Musk is like, I don't want to talk about this. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=474.6s)]
*  I don't want to. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=477.92s)]
*  Well, you need to talk about it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=478.92s)]
*  You need to talk about it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=481.46000000000004s)]
*  And you should talk about it, frankly, at a hearing before the House of Representatives [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=483.48s)]
*  and the Senate, although the Republicans are too cowardly to subpoena you. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=487.90000000000003s)]
*  But you got to answer these questions here. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=492.84000000000003s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=494.54s)]
*  But the interview didn't get off to a smooth start. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=495.54s)]
*  I noticed that all of your businesses involve a lot of components, a lot of parts. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=498.62s)]
*  Do the tariffs and the trade wars affect any of this? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=502.46000000000004s)]
*  You know, tariffs always affect things a little bit. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=506.06s)]
*  I'm wondering what your thought is on the ban on foreign students, the proposal. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=510.1s)]
*  I mean, you were one of those kids, right? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=514.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=516.62s)]
*  I mean, I think we want to stick to, you know, the subject of the day, which is like spaceships [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=517.62s)]
*  as opposed to, you know, presidential policy. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=525.38s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=528.62s)]
*  I was told anything's good. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=530.38s)]
*  But no, well, no. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=532.74s)]
*  And then you see Elon Musk trying to distance himself from the Trump regime here as well, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=537.38s)]
*  where he and he wants us, this is typical sociopath behavior where he plays the victim. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=542.3s)]
*  He wants us to feel bad for him, where he goes, you know, I'm really stuck in a bind [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=547.26s)]
*  because there are lots of things with the administration, the regime, the Trump regime [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=551.02s)]
*  that I disagree with, but I don't want to be associated with all of those things. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=555.66s)]
*  Well, you're the number one cheerleader. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=560.46s)]
*  You paid $300 million for this. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=562.8s)]
*  Own it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=565.02s)]
*  Own it, you coward. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=566.02s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=567.66s)]
*  And, you know, it's not like I agree with everything the administration does. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=568.66s)]
*  So it's like there's I mean, I agree with much of what the administration does, but [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=575.26s)]
*  we have differences of opinion. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=580.22s)]
*  You know, I think that I don't entirely agree with. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=582.74s)]
*  But it's difficult for me to bring that up in an interview because then it creates a [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=587.9s)]
*  bone of contention. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=591.34s)]
*  So then I'm a little stuck in a bind where I'm like, well, I don't want to, you know, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=592.4200000000001s)]
*  speak up against the administration, but I don't want to. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=597.9s)]
*  I also don't want to take responsibility for everything the administration is doing. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=603.34s)]
*  I just think about the image yesterday of Donald Trump golfing with these pro golfers [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=606.34s)]
*  and talking about who drives the ball longer. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=613.02s)]
*  And I just, you know, what do they say? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=617.98s)]
*  As Rome burns, Nero was playing the fiddle. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=621.02s)]
*  As Donald Trump destroyed the United States of America in our international alliances, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=624.02s)]
*  he was talking about who can drive golf balls longer. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=628.66s)]
*  So utterly pathetic. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=632.1s)]
*  But the rest of the world's standing up, stepping up. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=633.22s)]
*  Again, Ukraine with the support of the Coalition of the Willing, European Union countries like [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=637.14s)]
*  Germany, France, the UK, Spain and others, Canada, Australia as well. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=643.1s)]
*  We're seeing countries across the world just, you know, viewing the United States as a non-factor. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=650.02s)]
*  And the fact that President Zelensky, you know, I think said, I don't need to go through [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=656.94s)]
*  the United States anymore. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=660.62s)]
*  I'm going to defend my territory. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=662.5400000000001s)]
*  While Donald Trump was out there talking about golfing to me says it all. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=665.0600000000001s)]
*  And Zelensky did what he had to do. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=669.4200000000001s)]
*  Really one of the most successful military operations in combat history went down when [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=672.22s)]
*  he, when the Ukrainians destroyed those 40 plus Russian airplanes. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=678.74s)]
*  Powerful, powerful stuff. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=683.9s)]
*  And again, all Donald Trump's doing is posting images of himself and talking about UFC. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=685.86s)]
*  It's really utterly pathetic. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=693.98s)]
*  Oh, by the way, you have Maga Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene getting very angry [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=695.62s)]
*  that Moderna announced that the FDA approved a new vaccine against COVID-19 for use in [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=702.8599999999999s)]
*  all adults, 65 and older, as well as individuals age 12 through 64 with at least one underlying [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=709.02s)]
*  condition that puts them in high risk for severe outcomes. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=716.7399999999999s)]
*  She goes, not Maha at all. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=720.38s)]
*  Not Maha. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=723.14s)]
*  Unreal. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=724.14s)]
*  What? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=725.14s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=726.14s)]
*  I'll do a whole other video on this. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=728.66s)]
*  So keep checking back at the Midas Touch YouTube channel this morning. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=730.26s)]
*  But European Union not backing down to Donald Trump. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=733.66s)]
*  They're threatening countermeasures over Trump's steel tariff hike where Donald Trump said [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=737.06s)]
*  that he's going to be raising the steel tariffs 25% to 50%. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=743.9s)]
*  When remember Trump at the end of last week, he was at the US Steel Factory and he's been [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=748.3s)]
*  lying and claiming that Nippon Steel is investing in US Steel and not acquiring it when it is [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=753.18s)]
*  an acquisition. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=759.4599999999999s)]
*  And Trump said, you're all going to get bonuses and be so rich, which is false. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=760.4599999999999s)]
*  Now the European Union's like, we're going to have to impose countermeasures against [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=764.62s)]
*  you because now you're screwing with our steel exporters and that's not OK. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=769.14s)]
*  And we're trying to do it. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=774.5799999999999s)]
*  You know, you see this over and over again. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=775.5799999999999s)]
*  You know, you have countries who want to do deals. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=778.18s)]
*  You know, I mean, they'd like they'd like to do deals with the United States, not because [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=780.42s)]
*  of Trump, but because there were deals that existed before. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=784.48s)]
*  So like India wants to do a deal with the United States shouldn't shock you that countries [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=788.34s)]
*  want to do deals with the United States. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=791.7800000000001s)]
*  The United States should want to do deals with countries. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=794.5s)]
*  It's just Trump is blowing up all of these negotiations. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=796.98s)]
*  Like in India, you have Donald Trump basically wanting to take, take, take, take and not [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=800.7s)]
*  give anything in the people in India were like, you have to give some concessions. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=806.0600000000001s)]
*  You can't just attack us and and try to humiliate us. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=810.1s)]
*  You can't keep lying and claiming that it's because of your trade that there's a ceasefire [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=814.7s)]
*  between India and Pakistan. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=820.0s)]
*  You just got to you got to cut it out. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=821.46s)]
*  And then here in Europe, it's like, yeah, the European negotiators want to try to strike [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=823.22s)]
*  a deal with Trump because it's good for everybody if there's free trade. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=827.1600000000001s)]
*  And then Donald Trump goes from a 25 percent tariff to a 50 percent tariff, you know, and [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=831.62s)]
*  then he's taco about it. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=836.62s)]
*  Trump always chickens out and it's just, dude, just act like an adult. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=838.02s)]
*  You have some semblance of stability right here. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=842.8399999999999s)]
*  Behave, behave normally. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=845.24s)]
*  Anyway, we'll keep you posted every step of the way. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQlOwe8WbLw&t=847.28s)]
