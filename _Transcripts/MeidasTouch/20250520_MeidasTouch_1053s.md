# FATIGUED Trump CAVES in DISASTER Press Conference
**MeidasTouch:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY)
*  We are seeing in real time what a disaster Donald Trump's call with Vladimir Putin was yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump held a disastrous press conference today in the Oval Office. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  He said it was about building this golden dome, as he's calling it, over the United States of America, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=10.0s)]
*  this missile system that's going to cost hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=16.0s)]
*  But Donald Trump was asked about the breaking news that it looks like Russia is further amassing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=20.0s)]
*  troops along the borders towards Finland and Norway and whether that concerns Donald Trump. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=26.88s)]
*  Here's his response. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=34.08s)]
*  Mr. President, on Russia— [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=35.28s)]
*  People actually love it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=36.64s)]
*  Mr. President, on Russia, are you worried about the reports on a military buildup along the borders [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=38.08s)]
*  towards Finland and Norway? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=43.92s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=45.44s)]
*  I don't worry about that at all. They're going to be very safe. Those are two countries. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  They're going to be very safe. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=50.96s)]
*  And the second you said— [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=52.160000000000004s)]
*  Now, we can literally see where they are amassing their troops. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=53.36s)]
*  So Vladimir Putin gave Donald Trump a big middle finger yesterday, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=57.68s)]
*  and Donald Trump there saying he has no concerns. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=62.56s)]
*  He says it doesn't concern him at all that our NATO allies are being threatened [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=66.64s)]
*  by Vladimir Putin like that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=72.72s)]
*  Now, what Donald Trump did want to talk about, though, was not that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  He wanted to talk about this fake Declaration of Independence that's in the Oval Office, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=78.96s)]
*  which he claims was the original one. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=84.24s)]
*  And he just goes on this bizarre rant and says, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=86.55999999999999s)]
*  I took it from a vault. I got the declaration from a vault. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  The USA, by the way, very important. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=94.32s)]
*  So it's something that I've been looking forward to for a long time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=96.08s)]
*  And I just noticed you too, Jim, you're standing there behind you as a very important document, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=99.52s)]
*  Declaration of Independence. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  And that was in the vault for many decades under—right under this area. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=106.32s)]
*  They have vaults with pictures on top. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=112.0s)]
*  You have Abraham Lincoln. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=114.4s)]
*  You see that was the original Abraham Lincoln, the original Washington. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=115.44s)]
*  And does everybody know who the middle was? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=118.8s)]
*  General Grant. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=121.84s)]
*  And so it's very exciting. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=123.52s)]
*  You look over here and above Ronald Reagan, you have Thomas Jefferson. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=124.88s)]
*  That's Monroe from the Monroe document. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=130.0s)]
*  And you know who that is, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=134.4s)]
*  Andrew Jackson. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=137.28s)]
*  So we have a lot of very exciting pictures. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=138.64s)]
*  And on the other side, likewise, just some great presidents and great people on the— [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=140.48s)]
*  many of these people we're asking about and many of them, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=147.68s)]
*  almost all of them were in the vaults or nearby, but generally in the vaults downstairs. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=150.56s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty pathetic that what concerns Donald Trump is finding a fake [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=156.72s)]
*  Declaration of Independence from a fake vault versus actually talking about the issues that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=160.48s)]
*  matter to the American people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=166.0s)]
*  And here he is talking about what he calls this Golden Dome. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=168.32s)]
*  He goes, it's going to be $175 billion in total. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  He says that there's 25 billions going to go to the Golden Dome. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  Here's what he says. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=183.92s)]
*  One big beautiful bill will include $25 billion for the Golden Dome to help construction get [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=190.48s)]
*  underway. That's the initial sort of down posit. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=196.72s)]
*  And we have probably you're talking about, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=201.12s)]
*  general, we're talking about $175 billion total cost of this when it's completed. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=205.76s)]
*  So then he's asked like, so are you listening to military commanders or are you just winging this [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  yourself? And Trump says, it's my idea to do this Golden Dome. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=217.6s)]
*  He just likes the word gold and dome. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=222.0s)]
*  And so now he's putting this Golden Dome over the United States. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  When we have systems in place that deal with this already. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=231.04s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  As you had mentioned at the beginning of your remarks, this was a campaign promise of yours. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=235.76s)]
*  Have military commanders asked for this system specifically? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=239.84s)]
*  Because Norat had said previously that the current system was adequate. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=243.6s)]
*  So what does this get the United States? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=247.6s)]
*  There really is no current system. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=251.76s)]
*  We have certain areas of missiles and certain missile defense, but there's no system. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=253.28s)]
*  We just have some very capable weapons that hopefully we never have to use, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=259.28s)]
*  but we have some very capable weapons. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=264.4s)]
*  Now, this is a different league. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  There's never been anything like this. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=267.76s)]
*  This is something that's going to be very protective. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=269.2s)]
*  I think you can rest assured there'll be nothing like this. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=272.32s)]
*  Nobody else is capable of building it either. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=275.36s)]
*  Was it something that military commanders asked for? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=277.36s)]
*  Did they ask you to do this? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, let me put it differently. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=282.32s)]
*  I suggested it and they all said, we love the idea, sir. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=283.68s)]
*  To where it's got to be, right? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=287.36s)]
*  But they want it and they wanted it badly once it was suggested. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=288.96s)]
*  I don't know if they ever thought they would be lucky enough to have it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=292.08s)]
*  So Donald Trump is asked about the cost of his budget bill and programs like this. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=295.52s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to increase the military budget to $1 trillion [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=301.04s)]
*  while gutting Medicaid, gutting supplemental nutrition assistance programs, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=305.44s)]
*  gutting rental assistance programs. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=309.92s)]
*  He's taking away these key programs, but given these tax cuts for the billionaires [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=312.8s)]
*  that many estimate will cost at least $4 to $5 trillion. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  So then Donald Trump continues this lie where he says, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=321.92s)]
*  look, we just brought in $5 trillion from the Middle East. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  I've just collected $5 trillion. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=329.68s)]
*  So we're cool. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=332.16s)]
*  We're good. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=332.96s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=333.52s)]
*  When you first announced this idea, critics said it would be prohibitively expensive, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=334.48s)]
*  potentially ineffective and could trigger an arms race in space. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=339.44s)]
*  What do you say to those critics about that? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=343.36s)]
*  Well, they're wrong, sir. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  About as close to perfect as you can have in terms of real production. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=347.12s)]
*  I told you Canada wants to be a part of it, which be, you know, fairly small expansion. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=351.76s)]
*  But we'll work with them on pricing. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=357.28s)]
*  We'll be dealing with them on pricing. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=359.76s)]
*  They know about it very much. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=361.28s)]
*  They've asked to be a part of it, actually. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=362.24s)]
*  They've asked us to be a part of it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=364.32s)]
*  I think it's something that is great. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=367.36s)]
*  If you can afford to do it, we can afford to do it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=370.56s)]
*  You know, we took in $5.1 trillion in the last four days in the Middle East. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=372.8s)]
*  And when you think about it, this is a tiny fraction of that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=378.56s)]
*  But we make it all here. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=382.48s)]
*  We're going to make it all here. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=383.68s)]
*  We have one. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=384.88s)]
*  I will tell you, an adversary told me, a very big adversary told me the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=387.04s)]
*  most brilliant people in the world are Silicon Valley. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=391.84s)]
*  OK, he did not collect $5 trillion. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=394.32s)]
*  He didn't even collect anywhere near that amount of money at all. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=396.88s)]
*  Look, Saudi Arabia's entire annual GDP is $1.1 trillion. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=400.96s)]
*  Qatar's annual GDP is $200 billion. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=405.68s)]
*  And the United Arab Emirates GDP is $400 billion. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=409.28s)]
*  You add all of those annual GDPs up combined together, it is under $5 trillion. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=413.04s)]
*  These countries are not giving their entire annual GDP to the United States of America. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=420.56s)]
*  He's just coming up with a fake number the way he gives fake valuations for his properties [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=427.12s)]
*  to justify the fact that the deficit is going to increase by at least $5 trillion. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=432.16s)]
*  And if you listen to MAGA Republican Congress member Thomas Massey, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  he says that this GOP budget will increase the deficit by $20 trillion, is what he says. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=442.48s)]
*  Here Donald Trump's brain misfires as he tries to say the word document. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=450.24s)]

*  I said, sir. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=615.92s)]
*  This was a great vision, sir. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  Here, play this clip right here. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=618.88s)]
*  I'm going to talk about this. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=620.3199999999999s)]
*  How about you closing it out? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=622.56s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=624.0s)]
*  I mean, like I said, without your vision, willing to say and do things when other people [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=624.4799999999999s)]
*  wanted to look away and pretend like the threat didn't exist, or be focused on foreign [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=629.8399999999999s)]
*  adventurism, some other threat that we've been told is affecting us. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=634.0799999999999s)]
*  When you look at the data, sir, from Russia to the communist Chinese and other and their [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=638.24s)]
*  capabilities, what they're trying to do to supersede us and threaten us, how do we find [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=641.92s)]
*  the best innovators, the best military leaders, the best companies, tech companies, you mentioned [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=646.8s)]
*  open architecture. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=652.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=653.04s)]
*  So multiple companies can pour into this, sir. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=654.16s)]
*  It's a layered defense. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=656.24s)]
*  So if you miss that one, you catch at the next. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=657.28s)]
*  And it integrates existing technologies that can speak to each other. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=660.16s)]
*  So it moves quickly while also investing in further ranging space-based interceptors. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=663.52s)]
*  So our enemies, our adversaries are going to pay a lot of attention to this, just like [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=668.88s)]
*  they have to President Trump from day one. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=672.88s)]
*  Sir, you're defending the homeland, defending the American people. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=674.88s)]
*  It's going to benefit my kids and grandkids, all of ours in this room. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=678.56s)]
*  So thank you for your leadership. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=682.0s)]
*  We're going to charge you as fast as we can. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=683.04s)]
*  Great. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=684.56s)]
*  Just to remind you what Donald Trump had said after his call with Vladimir Putin. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=685.68s)]
*  This was from a press conference before this one where Donald Trump was asked, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=690.64s)]
*  you believe that Putin wants peace. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=696.24s)]
*  So if Putin wants peace, Donald, then why is he continuing to send ballistic missiles to kill [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=698.16s)]
*  innocent Ukrainians and drones every single day? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=705.1999999999999s)]
*  Ukraine's agreed to an unconditional ceasefire. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=708.64s)]
*  Putin has not. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=711.5999999999999s)]
*  What do you say to that, Donald? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=712.56s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=713.92s)]
*  You mentioned that you believe Putin wants peace, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=715.8399999999999s)]
*  but he just attacked Ukraine yesterday. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=718.96s)]
*  So what makes you think that he wants peace? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=722.0s)]
*  Well, he's in a war. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=723.84s)]
*  Nobody said don't. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=726.0s)]
*  They're fighting. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=727.76s)]
*  They're attacking. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=728.5600000000001s)]
*  They're attacking each other. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=729.2s)]
*  And people are dying all the time. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=731.12s)]
*  He's in a war. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=732.96s)]
*  He's fighting a war. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=733.6s)]
*  Nobody said he was going to stop. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=734.72s)]
*  I think, is it terrible? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=736.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's terrible. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=737.36s)]
*  I do. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=738.24s)]
*  I think it's terrible. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=738.88s)]
*  But one of the things Donald Trump has claimed is that during his call with Putin, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=743.2800000000001s)]
*  Putin kept on mentioning Melania and saying, Melania is very respected. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=746.96s)]
*  Melania is a very respected person. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=752.0s)]
*  OK, she's not. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=753.9200000000001s)]
*  And on Russian propaganda TV, they consistently show Melania nudes over and over again [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=755.0400000000001s)]
*  to mock Donald Trump. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=760.88s)]
*  Here's what he said here. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=761.9200000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=762.88s)]
*  And compassionate first lady, I would tell you she is very dedicated. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=763.6s)]
*  In fact, if you look at just what I heard, Putin just said they respect your wife a lot. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=768.48s)]
*  I said, what about me? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=775.36s)]
*  No, they will. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=776.64s)]
*  They like Melania better. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=777.52s)]
*  That wasn't good. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=780.0s)]
*  I don't know if that was good. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=781.3599999999999s)]
*  I'm OK with it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=782.4799999999999s)]
*  I'm OK. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=783.8399999999999s)]
*  And then in the other press conference, Donald Trump then talked about raising tariffs [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=785.3599999999999s)]
*  on aluminum, steel, cars, and pharmaceutical. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=789.92s)]
*  He goes, $50, $75, $100, maybe. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=793.1199999999999s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=796.8s)]
*  We'll just raise it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=797.52s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=798.4799999999999s)]
*  25 years, they were taking advantage of us. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=799.1999999999999s)]
*  We never did anything. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=801.8399999999999s)]
*  But now we're doing it to them and fairly very. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=803.1999999999999s)]
*  I'll tell you what, modestly. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=806.64s)]
*  But we'll be taking and we are taking in right now 25% in cars, 25% on steel and aluminum, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=808.56s)]
*  25% on other things. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=815.68s)]
*  And that'll be going up to 50, 75, maybe 100 in some cases. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=817.3599999999999s)]
*  We have to get our pharmaceutical industry back. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=821.68s)]
*  Once we establish that in another couple of weeks, it'll start roaring back. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=824.8s)]
*  It's already roaring back because they know we're doing it. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  And it's really been, you've done a great job. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=832.2399999999999s)]
*  The damage those pathetic statements are doing, it's hard to even quantify the damage being [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=836.64s)]
*  caused right there by Donald Trump because he continues to spread these lies or continues to [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=842.9599999999999s)]
*  then wake up and feel this way or that way about tariffs. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=850.0799999999999s)]
*  And it's having a real effect on our economy and making America look like North Korea, frankly. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=853.68s)]
*  So, Maga Mike Johnson holds a press conference while all of this is going on. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=861.3599999999999s)]
*  And he's asked a question. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=865.76s)]
*  Can you just talk to us about the budget? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=867.6800000000001s)]
*  What the hell is going on here right now? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=869.84s)]
*  And Maga Mike, he just goes, I'm not even going to answer questions. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=872.16s)]
*  I'm just going to give you my state regime talking points at this point here, play this clip. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=875.6s)]
*  ...back to deliver. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=880.32s)]
*  And that's what you'll see this house do this week. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=881.44s)]
*  Now, we're not going to take a lot of questions this morning because we've already done a ton [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=883.52s)]
*  of media with you in the halls. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=886.0s)]
*  The president gave you a lot, we gave you a lot. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=887.84s)]
*  What we're leaving to do right now is gather up the small subgroups in the House Republican [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=890.1600000000001s)]
*  Conference and tie up the remaining loose ends. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=894.72s)]
*  I'm very confident that we'll be able to do that. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=896.72s)]
*  There's a great esprit de corps in the room this morning because everybody knows what's at stake. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=898.72s)]
*  All the things we've talked about here this morning, we are going to get this done. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=902.48s)]
*  So, I'm going to, this is a rare thing. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=906.32s)]
*  I'm going to say, hold the questions and let me go get back to work so we can finish this thing up. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=908.72s)]
*  Okay. Thanks for being here this morning. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=912.88s)]
*  Thanks for seeing me. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=914.08s)]
*  And then finally, you know, Donald Trump lying and saying the reason that he's [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=920.0s)]
*  cutting food assistance programs is he says that's going to get you more food. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=924.32s)]
*  And then he lies and says gas prices are down to a buck 99. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=929.12s)]
*  They're not a buck 99 anywhere in the country. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=933.2s)]
*  He goes on to continue to lie and say that grocery prices are down and that inflation's [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=936.1600000000001s)]
*  down and things are going great, which is all a total lie. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=941.6s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=944.4000000000001s)]
*  You campaigned on lowering the price of groceries. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=945.0400000000001s)]
*  How do you justify cutting food assistance in this bill? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=948.1600000000001s)]
*  Let me just tell you, the cut is going to give everybody much more food because prices are [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=952.0s)]
*  coming way down. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=955.84s)]
*  Groceries are down. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=956.64s)]
*  Eggs. You told me about eggs. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=957.6s)]
*  You asked me a question about eggs my first week. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=958.72s)]
*  You said eggs. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=961.28s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=962.56s)]
*  Tell me about eggs. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=963.6s)]
*  And there's going through, if you know that eggs now way down. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=965.04s)]
*  Everybody's buying eggs. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=968.48s)]
*  Groceries down. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=970.0799999999999s)]
*  Energy's down. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=970.96s)]
*  Gasoline is now buying, they're buying gasoline now for a dollar 99. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=972.48s)]
*  When I, if you look back, you'll see $350, $4. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=977.28s)]
*  This country, we're going to lose this country. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=982.24s)]
*  Our country now is respected all over the world. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=984.4s)]
*  All over the world we're respected. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=986.88s)]
*  We were a laughing stock. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=988.4s)]
*  A complete disaster right now unfolding in the White House. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=990.56s)]
*  Weak, pathetic. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=994.0799999999999s)]
*  And that's Donald Trump's statement that he's not concerned about this clear and present [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=995.28s)]
*  threat to our NATO allies. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=999.4399999999999s)]
*  It's showing utter weakness. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=1002.4s)]
*  And let's be clear. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=1004.4799999999999s)]
*  The only thing that Donald Trump did yesterday in his call with Putin was basically say the [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=1005.36s)]
*  United States is out. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=1010.08s)]
*  Putin, do whatever the hell you want. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=1011.6800000000001s)]
*  Ukraine, good luck. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=1013.6800000000001s)]
*  America is out. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=1014.88s)]
*  After Donald Trump promised he was going to bring peace in 24 hours. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=1016.4s)]
*  A weak, pathetic, vile piece of trash? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=1020.4s)]
*  That is Donald Trump, who deserves zero respect whatsoever. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HfC9OUrfY&t=1023.2s)]
