# Trump CRUMBLES Fast and GIVES UP in PUBLIC
**MeidasTouch:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ)
*  Well, here we go again. Donald Trump is getting mocked by the entire world for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  caving once again to Xi Jinping in China, again showing that, guess what, Donald, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=5.12s)]
*  you don't hold the cards. Usually someone who's out there saying, I hold the cards, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=10.88s)]
*  you don't hold the cards. You often can call that a tell. You see some of these memes right here of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=16.16s)]
*  Xi Jinping just laughing at Donald Trump and outmaneuvering him. So yesterday, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=22.16s)]
*  Donald Trump held a press conference where he said the following. He said that the ultimate [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=26.96s)]
*  tariffs on China are going to be nowhere near 145%. Who would ever put 145% tariffs? That's too much. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=32.4s)]
*  That's what you said, Donald. Trump said it's going to come down substantially. It won't be [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=40.88s)]
*  zero. It's going to be more than zero, but we will see. And then he goes, I think we're going [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=45.28s)]
*  to be able to make a deal with China. This is after Donald Trump begged Xi Jinping in China to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=49.84s)]
*  call and do something, but China held firm and didn't do anything at all. Also, Donald Trump, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=55.92s)]
*  he's seeing the bond market implode. He's seeing the 10-year treasury yields move closer to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=61.52s)]
*  5%, which is basically, I think, well, technically 4.5%, I think, is Donald Trump's kind of pain [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  point, but it could go higher. And so now he wants to announce all of these fake deals. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=74.56s)]
*  So one of the things that was announced is that they may have an agreement in principle [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  with Japan on trade. It's an outline that they want to announce, but when you dig into the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=84.8s)]
*  details, again, it's just completely BS, and they're just once again just making it all up. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=90.24s)]
*  If you looked at what went down earlier in the day yesterday, I think it was one of the most [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=97.2s)]
*  important things, and it seems like more market manipulation taking place where – this is what [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=102.16s)]
*  was reported by Bloomberg – that Scott Bessent sees de-escalation with China. The situation is [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=107.92s)]
*  now looking unsustainable. There was a private meeting that was hosted by JP Morgan Chase in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=115.12s)]
*  Washington. It was not open to the public or to the media, but Scott Bessent was there, and all of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=122.56s)]
*  these hedge funds and private equity companies were there. A closed-door meeting, an investor [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=129.68s)]
*  summit where Scott Bessent said the standoff as it is with China right now is unsustainable, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=136.16s)]
*  and he expects the situation to de-escalate. So one of the things we noticed early in the morning, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=142.8s)]
*  despite all of this bad market data out there, the market was trading up and was doing well. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=148.64s)]
*  So it was like, what was driving that? Well, apparently there was a lot of insider information [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=155.68s)]
*  being exchanged during closed-door sessions where Wall Street wins and Main Street gets [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=161.28s)]
*  absolutely screwed as inside information is being exchanged. And then thereafter, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  you had Donald Trump hold this press conference in the afternoon, right, as markets had closed, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=175.36s)]
*  saying, you know, I think that we want to maybe de-escalate this with China once the insiders [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=181.44s)]
*  made a lot of their money after the market crashed. You see that kind of cycle repeat itself [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=187.44s)]
*  over and over again. Here's another meme that I saw. Listen up, President G. I'm sorry. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=192.72s)]
*  There's a lot going on though because Trump's volatility, what Trump's causing to the markets, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=199.76s)]
*  it's having real-world impact. Yesterday, Intel announced that a plan to lay off more than 20% [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=205.84s)]
*  of its staff this week. ConocoPhillips plans major layoffs as part of its broad restructuring. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=213.92s)]
*  Then you take a look at what was happening with Tesla. Elon sounded extremely depressed [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  on the earnings call yesterday after Tesla profits plunged 71% from this Gizmodo article. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=227.76s)]
*  They explained how Musk's tone was noticeably downbeat. He didn't have the same Carnival-style [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=236.32s)]
*  salesmanship that often accompanies the public-facing announcement for Tesla. He seemed [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=243.2s)]
*  very, very down. There was a few accounting tricks that they did as well where they sold some of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=250.48s)]
*  these regulatory credits, but for that, they would have actually lost money this quarter. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=256.64s)]
*  Donald Trump in the Oval Office, let me just share with you, this is the moment where he talked about [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=264.08s)]
*  how those 145% tariffs were too high. Very, very high, he said here. Play this clip. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=270.0s)]
*  145% is very high and it won't be that high. Not going to be that high. It got up to there. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=285.6s)]
*  We were talking about Fentanyl where various elements built it up to 145. No, it won't be. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=292.88s)]
*  Anywhere near that high. It'll come down substantially, but it won't be zero. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=300.4s)]
*  Used to be zero. We were just destroyed. China was taking us for a ride and just not going to have, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=307.6s)]
*  it's not going to happen. We're going to be very good to China. I have a great relationship with [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=315.52s)]
*  President Xi, but they would make billions and billions and billions of dollars a year and they [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=319.52s)]
*  would build their military out of the United States and what they made. So that won't happen, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=328.08s)]
*  but they're going to do very well and I think they're going to be happy and I think we're going to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=332.4s)]
*  live together very happily and ideally work together. So I think it's going to work out [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  very well, but no, it's at 145%. It will not be anywhere near that number. Oh, you know I had to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=341.36s)]
*  do it. Moink. Four companies control over 80% of the US meat industry. China now controls the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=348.32s)]
*  largest portion of US pork. These companies are using mobster-like tactics to crush American [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=356.08s)]
*  family farms and with the additives they're putting into our food, Americans are stuck [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=363.44s)]
*  with sketchy meat. So what can we do about it? Let me tell you about a company that's coming up [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  swinging on behalf of American family farms and your family's food security. It's called Moink. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  As I said at the beginning, Moink Moink. The business is simple. Moink's meat comes from [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  animals raised outdoors where a pig is free to be a pig. Their farmers are given an honest day's [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=385.2s)]
*  pay for an honest day's work and they deliver meat straight to your doorstep at prices that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=390.8s)]
*  you can actually afford. Born, raised and harvested right here in the United States. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  Support American family farms and join the Moink movement today at moinkbox.com [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=401.76s)]
*  slash MidasTouch right now and get free wings for life. They're the best wings you'll ever taste for [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=408.64s)]

*  moinkbox dot com slash MidasTouch. One of the things that Donald Trump said also and this is [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  what's the expression when a clown enters the palace they don't become royal. The palace becomes [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=430.64s)]
*  a circus or something like that. I always get the expression wrong but I mean here's Donald Trump now [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=437.84s)]
*  bragging. He says that he brought egg prices down 93 to 94 percent since the regime took office. It's [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=444.08s)]
*  the most ridiculous lie in the world. You think eggs were 84 dollars a dozen? I mean is this [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=453.52s)]
*  93 to 94 percent? It's just some of the most stupid lies that they tell and again it's just this over [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  and over again. Lie after lie after lie. Here play this clip. This is but if you remember my first [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=464.96s)]
*  week I was standing here Paul and they were screaming about eggs. The cost of eggs have gone [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=472.0s)]
*  through the roof. They were up like 500 crazy like four or five times and we won't have eggs for Easter [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=476.88s)]
*  they were saying. Be no eggs. You can't order eggs. They wanted us to order plastic in the shape of [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=484.08s)]
*  eggs. Well yesterday we had 48,000 people at the Easter hunt. They caught the Easter roll at the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=489.28s)]
*  White House and we had all eggs and as you know the cost of eggs has come down like 93, 94 percent [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=498.08s)]
*  since we took office and they're pretty much normally priced now. Great job our secretary [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  of agriculture Brooke Rollins did a very good job but groceries have come down. It's all coming [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=512.24s)]
*  down. The only thing that hasn't come down but hasn't gone up much are interest rates and we [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=517.68s)]
*  think the fed should lower the rate. We think that it's a perfect time to lower the rate. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  We'd like to see our chairman be early or on time as opposed to late. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=528.48s)]
*  Look the Associated Press reported that US egg prices increased to record highs this past week [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=534.96s)]
*  dashing hopes of cheap eggs by Easter. I mean those are just the facts. You know and the thing [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  with this Trump regime also is you know the cruelty is the point. You know there's all these [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=548.32s)]
*  distractions taking place as they're just screwing over you know marginalized communities, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=553.76s)]
*  just screwing over workers, screwing over just regular folks 401ks and pensions. You know [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=560.88s)]
*  just to give you an example so they say they want to abolish the Department of Education [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=567.52s)]
*  to get rid of education but they still want to use the Department of Education starting May 5th [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  to do a massive wage garnishment of millions of people who defaulted on their student loans. So [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=578.88s)]
*  they're doing a large-scale garnishment operation but then gutting services like lunch and helping [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=584.8s)]
*  poor kids and helping out kids with disabilities through the Department of Education and then [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=591.92s)]
*  there's this also so as RFK Jr. who runs HHS Health and Human Services goes on he's been [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=597.76s)]
*  giving all these speeches where he spreads lies about autism and vaccines just horrific stuff [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=605.76s)]
*  that he's saying. HHS is planning to cut the National Suicide Hotlines program for LGBTQ youth. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=610.88s)]
*  In February the program received an average of 2,100 contacts per day. So that's what they [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=619.04s)]
*  want to focus on too. The federal government plans to eliminate services for the LGBTQ youth [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=626.8s)]
*  who call 988 the National Suicide and Crisis Hotline. According to a Health and Human Services [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=632.4s)]
*  budget draft leaked last week the budget first reported by the Washington Post would go into [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=639.52s)]
*  effect October if approved by Congress. Since the hotlines launch in 2022 callers have been able to [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=644.56s)]
*  speak with counselors trained to work with specific at-risk populations including LGBTQ youth who are [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=651.04s)]
*  four times more likely to attempt suicide than their peers. The service for LGBTQ youth has [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  received 1.3 million calls texts or chats since 2022. In February the program received an average [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=663.6800000000001s)]
*  of 2,100 contacts per day. It's just pure unadulterated cruelty as RFK Jr. goes up and [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=671.0400000000001s)]
*  gives a press conference whining that his kids have food allergies and why do his kids have food [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=678.72s)]
*  allergies here play this clip? We have all these autoimmune diseases, these exotic diseases, and [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=683.52s)]
*  again I never heard of juvenile diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn's disease, and a hundred [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=689.76s)]
*  others that were just unknown when I was a kid. I never knew anybody with a peanut allergy. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=696.8s)]
*  I never knew anybody with a food allergy. Why do five of my seven kids have allergies? I never knew [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuA8lDheWQ&t=703.4399999999999s)]
