*  We at the Midas Touch Network found video of a trump town hall in 2020 with abc [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=21.2s)]
*  Where Donald Trump admits that he did not and does not have the power to send the national guard [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=28.740000000000002s)]
*  in order to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=36.82s)]
*  Attack communities the way he just did i'm going to show you that in just one moment [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=38.260000000000005s)]
*  Our researchers found it [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=43.7s)]
*  But we're seeing memes like this spread everywhere this from democratic congress member eric swalwell [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=45.94s)]
*  Who says this meme is everywhere? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=53.16s)]
*  Let's be kinder to each other making fun of an almost 80 year old falling on the stairs has no place in our politics [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=55.72s)]

*  But I want to share this with you right now because I think this shows you how equally reprehensible it is [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  not only is it unlawful for donald trump to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=84.6s)]
*  Federalize the national guard in california and frankly the order doesn't say it's limited to los angeles [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=89.3s)]
*  It's the entire country is what the order actually says [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=95.64s)]
*  But sending national guard troops and potentially the marines [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=99.8s)]
*  Against people living in los angeles [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  But get this [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=106.78s)]

*  Dr. Phil the tv host dr. Phil with ice agents [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=111.08s)]
*  Who are doing the raids? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=116.86s)]
*  So that they can capture this all on a tv show [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=119.02000000000001s)]
*  That they are making the very definition of state regime [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=123.58000000000001s)]
*  media [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=128.38s)]

*  Even in the portland case, we can't call in the national guard unless we're requested by a governor [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=149.10000000000002s)]

*  Trump arrested a mayor a member of congress and a labor leader now [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=280.88s)]

*  When police are best equipped to ensure safety and prevent violence, how'd we get here? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=290.48s)]
*  Trump decided to prioritize ripping apart families and communities instead of focusing on dangerous criminals [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=295.28s)]
*  This isn't law and order. This isn't making our country safer or fixing our border and it isn't [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=302.8s)]
*  leadership [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=309.66s)]

*  trump's borders are [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=313.6s)]
*  Someone who's not confirmed by the senate [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=315.6s)]
*  Just a bumbling mumbling fool [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=318.32s)]
*  Here he is on msnbc and he's asked [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=321.84s)]
*  Does everyone who has been arrested by ice have a criminal record and he goes absolutely not [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  We're going after everybody. It doesn't matter if you're a criminal or not [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=331.28s)]

*  Criminal record like those you've described [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=342.96s)]
*  Absolutely not and I said from day one january 20th, we will prioritize public safety threats and national security threats [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=345.2s)]
*  However, we will enforce law [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  I may prioritize my family life over my over my work. It doesn't matter nor my work [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=355.35999999999996s)]
*  We're going to force immigration on we've been asked about that from day one, especially in sanctuary cities [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=360.64s)]
*  Well, we can't get the bad guy in the safety and security of a jail [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=366.24s)]
*  They release him to the street [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  What we gotta go to the street and find him and when we find him many times with others others are in the united states [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=370.96s)]
*  So maybe may not be a criminal target [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  But guess what if ice is there arresting that bad guy other elements are there we're going to arrest them [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=379.12s)]
*  That's what sanctuary cities get they put us in the neighborhood. They force the neighborhood. This is what happens [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  Well that are you looking for something simple and delicious to add to your wellness routine? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=390.4s)]
*  I used to rely on regular honey for my breakfast tea and even salad dressings [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=394.32s)]
*  But then I found manakora and let me tell you it puts all other honey to shame [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=397.92s)]
*  Manakora honey is rich creamy and the most delicious honey i've ever had the best part [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=402.4s)]
*  It's ethically produced by master beekeepers in the remote forests of new zealand [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=407.44s)]
*  These bees collect nectar from the manuka tea tree, which is packed with bioactives giving manakora three times more antioxidants and prebiotics [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=411.68s)]
*  Than your average honey each morning [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  I start my day with a heaped teaspoon of manakora letting the creamy texture melt in my mouth and coat my throat [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=421.52s)]
*  And it's not just a tree [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  It's packed with powerful nutrients to support my immunity and gut health and here's something that sets manakora apart [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=428.0s)]
*  It contains a special antibacterial compound called mgo which comes from the manuka tea tree [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=434.08s)]
*  Manakora tests every harvest for mgo and you can see the results yourself through their qr system [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=440.24s)]
*  It's a honey with superpowers whether you're adding it to your food or enjoying it straight off the spoon. It's a game changer [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  Now it's easier than ever to try manakora honey just head to manakora.com [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=453.36s)]
*  That's mei das to get 25 off the starter kit which includes an mgo [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=459.6s)]
*  850 plus manuka honey jar five honey travel sticks a wooden spoon and a guidebook. That's [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=465.5s)]
*  Manakora.com [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=473.26s)]
*  Midas for 25 off your starter kit start your mornings with manakora. You'll never go back to ordinary honey [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=474.46000000000004s)]
*  Now i'd like to read for you a statement by one of the leaders [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=481.84000000000003s)]

*  Someone who is very well respected in the national guard. His name is major general randy manor [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=490.8s)]
*  And he criticizes trump sending the national guard to la and a statement to fox and fox published this statement [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=497.12s)]
*  Here's what he says [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=504.08000000000004s)]
*  the president's federal deployment of the national guard [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=506.32000000000005s)]
*  Over the official wishes of a governor is bad for all americans concerned about freedom of speech and states rights [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=509.76s)]
*  The governor has the authority and ability to respond to the civil disturbances [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=517.28s)]
*  with law [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=522.08s)]
*  enforcement capabilities within his state [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=523.26s)]
*  Augmented as necessary by requesting law enforcement assistance from other governors [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=525.9s)]
*  There are over a million badged and trained members of law enforcement in this country [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=531.52s)]
*  For the governor's to ask for help if he needs it while this is presently a legal order [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=537.1999999999999s)]
*  It tramples the governor's rights and obligations to protect his people [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=542.8s)]
*  This is an inappropriate use of the national guard and is not warranted [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=547.4399999999999s)]
*  One of the former top leaders of the national guard and all he's saying there to be clear is [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  It's presently a legal order because a court has not struck it down yet [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=557.04s)]
*  Although as I have said before when you look through the statute [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=562.56s)]
*  Or if you listen to donald trump's own words [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=566.64s)]
*  It is an unlawful order. So donald trump said in 2020 [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=570.4s)]
*  I think one of the things that um [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=575.28s)]
*  Is important to note as well while all of this is going on [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=577.76s)]
*  Is we can't forget about the budget bill [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=582.0s)]
*  We can't forget about the disastrous budget bill that will kick 15 million americans off of health care [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=584.88s)]
*  That will take away supplemental nutrition assistance program for people [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=591.04s)]
*  that will [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=595.68s)]
*  Lead to more people [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=597.1999999999999s)]
*  becoming unhoused [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=599.28s)]
*  Because it's taking away rental assistance and section 8 housing. It's an attack on women's reproductive rights [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=601.5999999999999s)]
*  But if you uh wanted to purchase a silencer for a gun [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  The budget bill says that you don't have to go through really any regulatory process anymore silencers [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=613.12s)]
*  Tanning beds got a lot of benefits and of course the billionaires [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=619.68s)]
*  Guns billionaires silencers billionaires and tanning beds [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=623.76s)]
*  Billionaires are going to get trillions in tax cuts and it's going to increase the deficit by five trillion dollars [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=628.24s)]
*  Here's what democratic senator? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=634.16s)]
*  Murphy had to say about this all it can also be true that [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=636.4s)]
*  Everything that's happened in the last seven days between the fight with elon musk and now [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=640.48s)]
*  Uh, the deployment of the national guard is probably also a distraction from the main story [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=645.4399999999999s)]
*  Which is that right now donald trump is trying to pass [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=650.0s)]
*  Probably the most unpopular piece of legislation that he will attempt to move through congress in his first term [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=653.8399999999999s)]
*  He's going to throw 15 million people off their health care in order to fund a massive tax cut for the wealthy [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  It's going to add two trillion dollars to our deficit [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=664.9599999999999s)]
*  We're probably going to head into a recession and so I do also think he's probably doing everything he can [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=667.04s)]
*  To try to get the entire political world to be talking about anything other [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  Than a piece of legislation that's going to fundamentally change this country [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=677.76s)]
*  So yeah, we have to point out the danger of what he's proposing to do in los angeles while also keeping [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=680.88s)]
*  Our eye on the ball, which is a bill that's going to transform our economy and ruin a lot of lives [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=687.8399999999999s)]
*  Should also be noted that nobody wants to work for secretary of defense pete hexeth [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=694.3199999999999s)]
*  Everybody's turning down job offers because they think he's utterly incompetent, which he is [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=699.04s)]
*  Another note that I want to share with you [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=704.4s)]
*  While donald trump promised that there was a trade deal with the uk [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=707.36s)]
*  A month later the duties with the uk the levies the tariffs remain in place [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=711.92s)]
*  There's no clear timeline when they're going to lift [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=717.6s)]
*  We're a month after the quote historic deal between the two sides [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=721.12s)]
*  And there's no clear timeline for when this will actually become a deal [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=725.1999999999999s)]
*  But if you've been watching the Midas Touch network, what have I been saying from day one? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=728.48s)]
*  It was never a deal. It was a memorandum of understanding that literally says on it [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=731.8399999999999s)]
*  This is not a binding deal. It was never a deal [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=736.08s)]
*  Also mergers and acquisition activity are approaching their lowest levels in decades meaning businesses are not [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=739.44s)]
*  Merging or acquiring they're in kind of a frozen [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=746.4s)]
*  Standstill mode remember donald trump saying drill baby drill. Well us oil rigs are increasingly going offline [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=750.06s)]
*  Um, the baker use us crude oil rate count has dropped to the lowest since [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=758.0s)]
*  2021 [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=762.9399999999999s)]
*  So actually the oil industry is suffering. I'm not sure i'm all that ups [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=764.8s)]
*  Well, I I I want american businesses to do well. I think that there should be diversified energy. I'll just leave it at that [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=769.04s)]
*  But donald trump made one promise and he did not meet that promise [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=776.64s)]
*  More news, of course about donald trump [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnx-PhiJq0&t=781.92s)]
