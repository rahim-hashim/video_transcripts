# SECRET Bombshell in GOP Disaster BILL FINALLY EXPOSED
**MeidasTouch:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ)
*  You know, we've covered this GOP disastrous budget bill from many angles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And I think the angle that's not getting enough attention is how these [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=5.04s)]
*  green energy tax credits that are job creators [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=9.96s)]
*  are going to be removed and it's going to cause lots of people to lose jobs [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=15.44s)]
*  and lots of jobs that can be created [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=21.2s)]
*  to never actually be created the way former President Biden. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=24.96s)]
*  And when this legislation was passed years ago, as it was intended to be created, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=29.52s)]
*  you know, the Republicans always would want to mock this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=34.8s)]
*  green new deal, green new deal, whatever. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=37.6s)]
*  And as they were mocking it, you know, what I've always been reporting on is that, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=40.84s)]
*  you know, China was smiling because they were going around to the world [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=44.72s)]
*  and they were saying, well, if America doesn't want to be the leaders [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=48.04s)]
*  and kind of green new energy, we'll do it because it's a job creator. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=50.96s)]
*  And former President Biden would say this a lot. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=57.04s)]
*  And we covered it here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=59.2s)]
*  He would go around to talk about how clean energy tax incentives [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=60.36s)]
*  will help make clean energy jobs, good paying union jobs. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=64.12s)]
*  And we're seeing it from labor laborers and carpenters [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  building solar farms, ironworkers and operating engineers, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=73.4s)]
*  building wind projects, electricians installing solar panels and EV chargers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=78.04s)]
*  Heck, I remember when I visited Colorado and I saw the wind turbine plants there [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=84.28s)]
*  and the jobs that were being created there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=88.8s)]
*  On the other hand, you know, you've had Donald Trump [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=91.68s)]
*  and these Republicans attack this, attack it as they call it, a green new scam. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=94.76s)]
*  But folks, we're seeing it in the data. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=100.12s)]
*  I mean, the manufacturing data that came out on Monday shows manufacturing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=102.0s)]
*  in a contraction where people were saying there was a manufacturing boom [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=107.36s)]
*  under former President Biden. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=112.04s)]
*  And I was just saying, you know, when you watch Donald Trump go around [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=113.84s)]
*  on the campaign, you know, he was saying some of this crazy tariff stuff [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=116.88s)]
*  then as well, like here he was when he was on Joe Rogan, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=120.92s)]
*  basically attacking Biden legislation and saying, you know what we really need? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  We need we need tariffs. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=129.6s)]
*  We need tariffs here. Play this clip. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  They do it. But let me just say that chip deal so bad. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  We put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come in [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=137.48s)]
*  and borrow the money and build chip companies here. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  And they're not going to give us the good companies anyway. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=143.8s)]
*  All you had to do is charge them tariffs. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=146.6s)]
*  If you would have put a tariff on the chips coming in, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=148.48s)]
*  you would have been able to just like the auto companies. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=152.4s)]
*  No different, more sophisticated, but no different. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=154.96s)]
*  You know, Taiwan, they stole our chip business. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=158.68s)]
*  OK, they want us to protect and they want protection. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=162.8s)]
*  They don't pay us money for the protection. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=165.6s)]
*  You know, the mob makes you pay money, right? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=167.28s)]
*  I want to bring in former Washington state governor Jay Inslee. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=169.88s)]
*  Governor Inslee served as governor in the state of Washington, 2013 through 2025. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=174.56s)]
*  Governor, I want to get your perspective, you know, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=180.12s)]
*  as someone who's, you know, had to actually run a state. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't have the luxury of just, you know, speaking in sound bites. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, and you have to represent Democrats, Republicans, independents, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=192.96s)]
*  libertarians in your state. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=198.11999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you saw firsthand how clean energy tax credits were helping your state. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=199.44s)]
*  Talk to us about what this reconciliation bill is going to do. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  It'll do a lot of damage to the best and brightest hopes of Americans in all 50 states. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=208.55999999999997s)]
*  And I would point out that you can have job creation, clean energy, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=215.88s)]
*  because we're having in my state like crazy, both because of the preexisting [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=220.32s)]
*  work by Biden and team and by our state action. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=224.16s)]
*  Our clean energy sector has been absolutely rocking it, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=227.72s)]
*  putting people to work across the state of Washington. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=231.28s)]
*  But that is if not come into a screeching halt, severely diminished by Trump's threats. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=234.24s)]
*  The two things I want to point out about the idiocy of his policies, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  and it is idiocy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=245.32s)]
*  I don't know how else to describe it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=246.32s)]
*  And the only reason Republican senators should even give this [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=248.32s)]
*  the time of day is because they are acting as a cult right now, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=251.56s)]
*  not listening to even their basic knowledge of economics [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=255.24s)]
*  and the basic job and economic needs of their constituents in two ways. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=259.92s)]
*  There's two ways I want to point out that I don't think have been discussed enough. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=264.6s)]
*  One is on the job front. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=268.76s)]
*  You've correctly pointed out this is going to cost thousands of jobs. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=270.52s)]
*  And analysis has already been done by the Climate Power Organization [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=274.04s)]
*  that it is already being done. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=277.6s)]
*  The climate power organization that it has already cost about 62000 [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=279.16s)]
*  jobs across the United States, and it is already causing [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=283.52s)]
*  huge contraction of investment. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=287.88s)]
*  There are projects being canceled. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=290.08s)]
*  I talked to a person in the in the capital financing word the other day [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=291.76s)]
*  that lost a multi hundreds of millions of dollars deal because of this. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=295.48s)]
*  Even the fear of this happening has contracted this job market. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=299.8s)]
*  That is well known. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=304.0s)]
*  I think the point that I'd like to stress, though, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  when people think of clean energy, they think of, you know, nuclear scientists [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=308.08s)]
*  or photovoltaic engineers. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=312.67999999999995s)]
*  These are these are blue collar jobs. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=314.52s)]
*  These are skilled jobs in making these turbines, manufacturing, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=317.23999999999995s)]
*  construction jobs, putting it up, maintaining. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=321.44s)]
*  These are high tech manufacturing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=324.23999999999995s)]
*  These are the jobs we want our kids to have if they don't want to spend [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=326.2s)]
*  four hundred thousand dollars going to college. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  It's exactly what we've all been talking about of how to create new jobs [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=332.0s)]
*  for the working families. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=336.04s)]
*  And a lot of Democrats been gnashing their teeth. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=337.36s)]
*  How are we going to connect with working families? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, here's a way to do it, to show that Trump and his crew [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=342.0s)]
*  are trying to kill jobs for working families, particularly young people. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  But there's a second part of this. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  I want to emphasize it really is not had much discussion. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  Trump ran on reducing inflation. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=353.92s)]
*  He ran on reducing costs of energy. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=357.36s)]
*  He is going to give us the most expensive energy [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=360.48s)]
*  in the history of the United States by taking away [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=363.44s)]
*  snatching from Americans the cheapest energy now available, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=366.8s)]
*  which isn't coal. It is not coal. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=372.08s)]
*  Coal is more expensive than 92 percent of the districts in America. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=374.44s)]
*  Solar wind, battery technology, efficiency. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=378.24s)]
*  These systems are cheaper and that those fossil fuels [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=381.96s)]
*  are going to get more expensive as demand ramps up for electricity [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=385.8s)]
*  because demand is going to ramp up because of the oncoming AI [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=389.48s)]
*  and crypto needs of these data farms. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=392.56s)]
*  As demand ramps up, Americans are going to face a price [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=394.88s)]
*  shock unless we really start to create more energy through cheaper means. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=398.16s)]
*  And that price shot to me is almost the most amazing [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=402.92s)]
*  elimination of what Trump said he was going to do. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=408.6s)]
*  Plus, he wants to dominate energy. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=411.2s)]
*  Look, if you want to dominate energy, bring it home, build it here, make it here. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=413.08s)]
*  This is, you know, the sun shines here. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=416.2s)]
*  This is our son. Nobody can divert it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=418.44s)]
*  The wind blows here. China can't steal the wind. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=420.44s)]
*  We've got battery scientists. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=423.52s)]
*  They can't steal the scientists until Trump eliminated university research, of course. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=424.84s)]
*  So for multiple ways, you can't overstate the damage. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=429.36s)]
*  This would happen. But we still have some hope in the Senate. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=433.44s)]
*  We hope people rise up, let senators know what they ought to be doing here. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=436.48s)]
*  You know, but as you say, they are kind of functioning as a cult. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=441.28s)]
*  You can give all of the objective data that you just gave. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=444.24s)]
*  You can talk about to these Republicans in the Senate [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=448.76s)]
*  that you're going to be hurting your own constituents. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=451.96s)]
*  You're going to be hurting your own state. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=454.64s)]
*  And then Donald Trump gives a speech and he goes windmills. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=457.28s)]
*  A ring, a ring, a ring, a ring, a ring. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=460.11999999999995s)]
*  And I look at it and I'm like, what the hell is he talking about? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=463.35999999999996s)]
*  And then I'm sure a lot of these people who, you know, look at it and go, OK, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=466.79999999999995s)]
*  windmills bad. And I'm thinking what and I'm [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=470.44s)]
*  I think I and so many Americans watch it and go, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  are we missing? What is going like? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=477.79999999999995s)]
*  When did politics have you or Governor in 2013? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  How did we get here? How do we stop that? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=485.96s)]
*  Well, it is you're right. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=488.32s)]
*  It has become a cultish behavior and it is difficult to break. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=490.52s)]
*  But that is our goal. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=494.44s)]
*  And that is a necessity right now. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=495.88s)]
*  And the way you break the cult is you threaten the political survival [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=498.44s)]
*  of politicians to let them know that your survival, if you stay in a cult, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  you're not going to be office in office again. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=506.76s)]
*  And it's just really simple. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  Democracy, when it's boiled down, is kind of a simple enterprise. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=510.03999999999996s)]
*  Citizens need to know their congresspeople and senators [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=514.92s)]
*  are not going to be in office again if you destroy our energy future, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=518.92s)]
*  if you give us more expensive electricity, if you give us less cancer research, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=523.6s)]
*  if you give us less research in all of these emerging technologies. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=529.24s)]
*  If you do these things, you're not going to be in office. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=534.08s)]
*  Now, it's just really in some sense simple. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=536.08s)]
*  Give an example. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=538.44s)]
*  So there are 12 members of the US Congress [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=539.5600000000001s)]
*  from the House who wrote a letter saying, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  pretty please don't do don't take away these energy tax credits [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=546.5200000000001s)]
*  because they're they're hurting our job creation in our districts. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=550.6s)]
*  Then they turned around and voted for it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=554.9200000000001s)]
*  And at the at the urging of the right wing or their party, in fact, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=557.0400000000001s)]
*  accelerated the destruction of those jobs. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=560.12s)]
*  Those people got to feel the heat. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=563.36s)]
*  There needs to be people letting them know right now [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=565.44s)]
*  that you're not coming back if you continue down this course. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=567.8000000000001s)]
*  And those congresspeople need to talk to their senators. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=570.9200000000001s)]
*  Look, you got Senator Tillis there in North Carolina. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=574.0s)]
*  He's a very vulnerable Republican senator. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=577.6800000000001s)]
*  And people in North Carolina and around the nation [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=580.4000000000001s)]
*  need to let him know that what's coming down the pike [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=583.5600000000001s)]
*  if he doesn't fix this problem in this bill. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=586.72s)]
*  And he's made noises about it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=589.7600000000001s)]
*  But frankly, we've been quite disappointed in Republicans [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=592.08s)]
*  who've made noises, who've written love letters to Thune and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=595.36s)]
*  but then turn around vote for it. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=599.4000000000001s)]
*  So this is up to us to bring the heat. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=600.96s)]
*  If we can do that, we've got great stories of young people [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=604.2s)]
*  who want to build wind turbines, brilliant battery technicians [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=607.2800000000001s)]
*  whose jobs are being eliminated now because of this. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=610.96s)]
*  Those people ought to be in the lobbies talking to their senators, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=613.76s)]
*  let them know what they think. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=617.24s)]
*  And this is a matter of doubt. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=618.9200000000001s)]
*  This is not a done deal yet. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=620.8s)]
*  And the reason is there are so many problems with this bill [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=622.3199999999999s)]
*  that it lights up multiple places in the U.S. Senate. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  You have some people actually don't want to cut Medicaid [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  because they think that's bad [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=634.0799999999999s)]
*  politically for them to throw people out of the hospital [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=635.9599999999999s)]
*  when they're having a heart attack. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=638.64s)]
*  Some people don't want to have the massive deficit [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=640.4s)]
*  increases that are associated with this. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=643.56s)]
*  And a few people understand they don't want to reduce our ability [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=646.16s)]
*  to get clean, cheap electricity. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=649.36s)]
*  So you've got multiple players here who have a way [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=652.48s)]
*  bring down this monstrosity monstrosity of a bill. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=656.08s)]
*  So I guess what I'm counseling is action [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=659.72s)]
*  to use your First Amendment rights and realize these people work for you. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=663.08s)]
*  And for all of those scores, it's three strikes you out on this bill. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=667.6s)]
*  Governor Inslee, I want to there's so much more I want to talk to you about. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=671.96s)]
*  I want to schedule another interview where I want to talk about [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=676.52s)]
*  FEMA. I want to talk about all of these things. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=679.0s)]
*  And we'd love we'd love to have you back on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=681.56s)]
*  But I really appreciate you. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=684.52s)]
*  And what are you up to these days outside of, you know, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=686.44s)]
*  what's the day to day like right now? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=690.72s)]
*  Well, I'm continuing the work I've done as governor. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=693.12s)]
*  As you know, we adopted the most aggressive clean energy [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=695.84s)]
*  climate fighting laws in the nation, if not the world outside of Norway. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=698.84s)]
*  So I'm continuing to push those. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=703.4s)]
*  I'm working with a group called Climate Power and serving as a spokesperson [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=704.84s)]
*  for them to try to encourage other states to join Washington. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=708.4s)]
*  And by the way, there is help here because states can move forward [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=711.9599999999999s)]
*  on many of the things we've done. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=716.1999999999999s)]
*  100 percent electrical grid, clean energy building standards, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=717.84s)]
*  new subsidized heat pumps and electrical charging stations. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=721.92s)]
*  States can do these things. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=725.72s)]
*  Mostly can't be stopped by Donald Trump. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=727.76s)]
*  So one of the things I'm doing working with Climate Power [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=730.84s)]
*  is other people around the states to encourage state action. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=733.24s)]
*  We have 24 states right now in our U.S. climate alliance. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=736.64s)]
*  This is something I started with Jerry Brown during the first Trump administration. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=740.04s)]
*  We represent 60 percent of the U.S. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=743.88s)]
*  economy and each one of our states can move the needle [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=745.8399999999999s)]
*  as they do destruction federally. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=749.5999999999999s)]
*  We have our own ability to do that. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=751.8s)]
*  It's the United States of America. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=753.28s)]
*  So I'm working on that. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=756.0s)]
*  I'm working on gun safety issues with the Alliance for Gun Responsibility. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=756.88s)]
*  We're building that out nationwide as well. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=759.88s)]
*  So I'm still in the hut. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=762.2399999999999s)]
*  I'm pretty motivated on this for good reason. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=764.28s)]
*  Governor Inslee, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=768.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdpEKQn_BQ&t=770.08s)]
