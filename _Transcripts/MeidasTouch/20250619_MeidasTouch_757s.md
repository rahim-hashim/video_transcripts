Video Description: MeidasTouch host Ben Meiselas reports on Donald Trump getting destroyed by the pressure of the presidency that is far too big for him to even come close to handling and how he is crashing fast and looks visibly shaken as he pushes America closer to a war in the Middle East with Israel and Iran.

# Trump LOSES CONTROL as BAD NEWS BURIES HIM
**MeidasTouch:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek)
*  Our editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski puts it best. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=0.0s)]
*  Inflation is up, prices are rising, interest rates are up, GDP is down, we are going to [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=3.4s)]
*  war with Iran. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=9.44s)]
*  But the good news is Donald Trump had two new flagpoles put up at the White House yesterday, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  and that's what he was bragging about. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=18.32s)]
*  Have you seen these gigantic polls on the North and South lawn of the White House? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=20.22s)]
*  Donald Trump held a press conference where he used construction workers as props to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=26.32s)]
*  talk about the gigantic flagpoles he's putting in front and the back of the White House, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=32.32s)]
*  which looks like a total eyesore. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=38.04s)]
*  And as one commentator puts it, whether there is a new Mideast war or not is based on the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=41.1s)]
*  whims of an attention-seeking toddler. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=47.82s)]
*  So Donald Trump is asked, while he has these construction workers behind him, about war [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=52.08s)]
*  with Iran, and Donald Trump's response is, maybe I do it, maybe I don't do it, maybe [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=57.96s)]
*  I don't even know, maybe I'm going to do it, maybe I don't, I don't even know. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=65.08s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=70.12s)]
*  Will you strike the Iranian nuclear component? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=71.36s)]
*  And what time exactly, sir? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=75.12s)]
*  Sir, would you strike it? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=76.96s)]
*  Would you please inform us so we can be there and watch? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=79.0s)]
*  I mean, you don't know that I'm going to even do it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=81.56s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=84.12s)]
*  I may do it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=85.12s)]
*  I may not do it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=86.12s)]
*  I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=87.12s)]
*  I can't even believe that is a real clip that I am showing you. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=88.12s)]
*  Donald Trump then posts great poll numbers for Trump, and then maybe he thinks poll numbers [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  are polls, like actual physical polls going up. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=99.44s)]
*  My polls are going up, and he's talking about the gigantic flagpoles because all of his [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=103.84s)]
*  polls are going down, down, down. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  The worst polling in American presidential history, essentially, whether it's Quinnipiac, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=112.46000000000001s)]
*  whether it's YouGov, whether it's APNORC or even Fox, Donald Trump's polling is like [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=118.12s)]
*  the worst ever while he's putting flagpoles up. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=124.12s)]
*  We also learned that the U.S. is moving its military assets into the Middle East, making [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=129.2s)]
*  them vulnerable to Iranian attack. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=134.44s)]
*  The U.S. military has moved some aircraft and ships from bases in the Middle East that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=137.6s)]
*  may be vulnerable to any potential Iranian attacks, two sources say, as Trump is, quote, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=142.2s)]
*  getting comfortable with strikes on Iranian nuclear facility sources, say. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=149.76s)]
*  And they say that he's approved these strikes, but he's still waiting to give the order. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  But he's approved, in theory, these strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities using American [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=162.12s)]
*  planes. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump was talking about war with Iran at a bizarre press conference he held [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  yesterday with the Juventus Italian football club who was there for the FIFA games. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=176.28s)]
*  That's why they were in the United States. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm not sure why they were in the Oval Office while Donald Trump was talking about war with [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=184.32s)]
*  with the Juventus football club behind him because he's an attention seeking toddler. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=190.22s)]
*  No offense to attention seeking toddlers. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=195.46s)]
*  Then Donald Trump lies and claims that the Iranians were begging to take a visit to the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=198.02s)]
*  White House, which Iran then denied and said, we definitely do not want to be at the White [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=203.74s)]
*  House. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=209.02s)]
*  Donald Trump is an absolute liar. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=210.02s)]
*  Here's Donald Trump saying that Iran wants to be at the White House with Juventus behind [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=212.38s)]
*  him play this clip. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=216.94s)]
*  In the end, they decided not to do it, and now they wish they did it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=217.94s)]
*  And they want to meet, but it's a little late to meet, but they want to meet and they want [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=222.22s)]
*  to come to the White House. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=226.9s)]
*  They'll even come to the White House. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=227.9s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=228.9s)]
*  I may do that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=229.9s)]
*  But it's a shame it wasn't, could have been done the easy way. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=230.9s)]
*  Now as you know, by now, Donald Trump fled the G7 on Monday. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=235.26s)]
*  He was not there for the working session on Tuesday. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=240.1s)]
*  He missed key meetings with President Zelensky of Ukraine, Prime Minister Modi of India, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=243.18s)]
*  President Claudia Scheinbaum of Mexico. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=249.1s)]
*  After I release this video that you're watching, I'm going to do another video on how furious [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  India is with Donald Trump because he keeps lying and making up that he negotiated the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=257.38s)]
*  ceasefire and mediated it between India and Pakistan. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=262.86s)]
*  But let me show you here Prime Minister Modi speaking with French President Emmanuel Macron [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=266.18s)]
*  mocking Donald Trump for doing social media posts about war and things like that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=272.74s)]
*  Modi goes to the French President, nowadays I hear you fight on Twitter. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=279.5s)]
*  Here watch this. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=284.54s)]
*  Nowadays you are fighting on Twitter? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=285.54s)]
*  You see them laughing at the United States. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  Trump is quite literally the laughing stock. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=292.82000000000005s)]
*  Here's more photos that Donald Trump and others have been posting about his flagpole. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=295.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, Donald Trump, nice that you're talking about flagpoles in front of the White [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=300.94s)]
*  House again. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  Looks like a complete and utter eyesore. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=305.78000000000003s)]
*  You know what Donald Trump did not address? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=308.74s)]
*  Two soldiers deployed in the Middle East died in the past 48 hours. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=310.78000000000003s)]
*  And Donald Trump has not spoken about that at all. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=316.78000000000003s)]
*  But why would he? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=319.02000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump hasn't spoken about the four US soldiers who died in Lithuania. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=320.38s)]
*  The Lithuanian government gave them a respectful and solemn sendoff. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=324.94s)]
*  Donald Trump totally ignored it because he says if he doesn't address it, he could just [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=329.62s)]
*  pretend it never happened. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=333.65999999999997s)]
*  Two United States soldiers died at the border. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=335.41999999999996s)]
*  One lady died as a result of an Abrams tank falling on her following the military parade. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=338.5s)]
*  Dozens of Americans have died in disastrous storms in the past two months. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump has not acknowledged any of that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=350.18s)]
*  He just thinks if he ignores the suffering and pretends it's not happening, then it [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=353.9s)]
*  will just go away. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=359.1s)]
*  Where do we hear that? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=360.98s)]
*  Oh, COVID, like a miracle, it will all just go away. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=361.98s)]
*  Just pretend the problems aren't real. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=364.66s)]
*  Don't effectuate your solemn duty as the president to address these things. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=367.38s)]
*  You remember the clip I showed you, right? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=371.66s)]
*  Two days ago where Donald Trump was asked, hey, are you going to call Governor Walls [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=374.1s)]
*  of Minnesota, who was a target of the assassin in Minnesota and who was close friends with [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=379.14s)]
*  the state representative, the speaker who got killed by the assassin, as did her husband. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=386.18s)]
*  Minnesota is going through a lot, right? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=392.3s)]
*  So Trump was asked, hey, you're going to call Governor Walls? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=393.46s)]
*  And Trump's like, why would I call that whack job? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=396.46s)]
*  He's a wacko. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=398.38s)]
*  Why would I call him? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=399.38s)]
*  Remember when Trump said this? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=400.38s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=401.38s)]
*  Have you called the governor yet or been able to speak to any of them? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=402.38s)]
*  I don't really call him. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=403.38s)]
*  He's like, he appointed this guy to the position. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=404.38s)]
*  I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=405.38s)]
*  I'm not calling him. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=406.38s)]
*  He's a mess. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=407.38s)]
*  So I could be nice to him. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=408.38s)]
*  I think he's a mess. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=409.38s)]
*  I think he's a mess. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=410.38s)]
*  I think he's a mess. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=411.38s)]
*  I think he's a mess. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=412.38s)]
*  I think he's a mess. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=413.38s)]
*  So I could be nice to call him. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=414.58s)]
*  But why waste that? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=416.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's why this individual is unfit to be anywhere near proximity of leadership. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=418.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=424.58s)]
*  And again, as I've said, when I started the Midas Touch Network, I'm not a political guy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=425.58s)]
*  I've never even viewed these things. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=430.98s)]
*  Oh, Democrat, oh, Republican, oh, liberal, oh, conservative. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=432.98s)]
*  Let's just view it as human beings and adult behavior and acting mature and acting responsible [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=436.9s)]
*  and behaving like grownups. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=444.3s)]
*  Like that behavior right there is sickening. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=447.3s)]
*  That shouldn't be, oh, Republicans just behave that way or oh, Democrats. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=450.3s)]
*  No, that's just sickening freaking behavior. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=454.3s)]
*  And Donald Trump's behavior is having real world ramifications on our entire economy. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=457.3s)]
*  A massive stagflation warning was issued today. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=462.3s)]
*  The Fed is now predicting a brutal mix for 2025. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=465.3s)]
*  Inflation up 3%. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=470.3s)]
*  Growth down 1.4%. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=472.3s)]
*  Unemployment up 4.5%. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=473.3s)]
*  They're holding interest rates steady for now. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=476.3s)]
*  They expect maybe two interest rates cuts this year. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=478.3s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=482.3s)]
*  But we should have had multiple interest rate cuts right now. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=483.3s)]
*  Former President Biden was bringing inflation down to 2% the Fed target. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=486.3s)]
*  Then Donald Trump declared a trade war against the world. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=490.3s)]
*  Here's how Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, put it yesterday, play this clip. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=494.3s)]
*  Changes to trade, immigration, fiscal and regulatory policies continue to evolve. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=500.3s)]
*  And their effects on the economy remain uncertain. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=505.3s)]
*  The effects of tariffs will depend, among other things, on their ultimate level. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=509.3s)]
*  Expectations of that level and thus of the related economic effects reached a peak in April [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=513.3s)]
*  and have since declined. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=518.3s)]
*  Even so, increases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=521.3s)]
*  Inflation could be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=529.3s)]
*  It's also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=534.3s)]
*  Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the tariff effects, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=538.3s)]
*  on how long it takes for them to pass through fully into prices, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=541.3s)]
*  and ultimately on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=545.3s)]
*  In contrast, Donald Trump bragging about his poll numbers yesterday next to the poll. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=549.3s)]
*  That's why I think he thinks the poll is a poll. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=554.3s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=557.3s)]
*  So I may have some people that are a little bit unhappy now, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=558.3s)]
*  but I have some people that are very happy. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=561.3s)]
*  And I have people outside of the base that can't believe that this is happening. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=563.3s)]
*  They're so happy. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=566.3s)]
*  And there was a poll that just came out today that my approval rating is the highest it's ever been. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=567.3s)]
*  All I'm doing is saying you can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=572.3s)]
*  And I tried to do it nicely. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=575.3s)]
*  And then on day 61, I said, let's go, because we can't let that happen. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=576.3s)]
*  And I've been saying it for 20 years. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=581.3s)]
*  And that's not a crazy thought by me. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=583.3s)]
*  I mean, here's Donald Trump who thinks he talks to Hannibal Lecter. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=585.3s)]
*  Oh, what happened to Alcatraz? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=588.3s)]
*  Is Alcatraz week done? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=590.3s)]
*  What about Trump Gaza? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=592.3s)]
*  Wasn't he going to build all the hotels there? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=594.3s)]
*  What would it be? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=596.3s)]
*  You know, the things that this guy has said over the past several months [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=598.3s)]
*  that we cover at the Midas Touch Network that no one else does, really. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=603.3s)]
*  Here he is yelling at a CNN reporter, asking him a question. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=608.3s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=612.3s)]
*  Mr. President, some of your supporters are swaying on the U.S. response to CNN. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=613.3s)]
*  There's a split, though. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=621.3s)]
*  Unfortunately, nobody watches. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=622.3s)]
*  Is anybody watching CNN nowadays? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=624.3s)]
*  I haven't seen it in a long time. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=627.3s)]
*  Some of your supporters are wary of the U.S. getting involved in another foreign wall. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=629.3s)]
*  No, no, I haven't seen them. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=634.3s)]
*  And any company that we should support. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=636.3s)]
*  Do you ever ask a positive question at CNN? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=637.3s)]
*  My supporters are more in love with me today and I'm in love with them more than they were even at election time. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=639.3s)]
*  Just so you see how little respect world leaders have for him, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=645.3s)]
*  just look at the wink right here with Prime Minister Carney and the French president Emmanuel Macron. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=649.3s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=654.3s)]
*  I think we got a lot done. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=655.3s)]
*  Really a lot done. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=657.3s)]
*  In fact, in the UK we signed a big great deal today and we're working on others. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=658.3s)]
*  But we had just a really great relationship with everybody. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=664.3s)]
*  It's really nice. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=668.3s)]
*  I wish I could stay for tomorrow, but they understand. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=669.3s)]
*  While all of that is going on, here's the Donald Trump ICE agents disappearing human beings. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=672.3s)]
*  What I'm showing you in this video, people showing up to court, trying to do the right thing, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=679.3s)]
*  going through their lawful process as ICE agents wait for them in court, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=684.3s)]
*  grab them, rip them apart from their family. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=690.3s)]
*  This is happening every day, everywhere in the country, thousands of times a day. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=693.3s)]
*  The fascist United States of America. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=699.3s)]
*  No wonder people don't want to come here when this is what will happen to you. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=701.3s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=705.3s)]
*  Horrific stuff right there. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPYvZSuFBek&t=723.3s)]
