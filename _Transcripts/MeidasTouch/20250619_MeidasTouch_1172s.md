# MAGA Mike GETS SCREWED by OWN Party as BILL BLOWS UP
**MeidasTouch:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E)
*  Remember when Donald Trump and Mike Johnson would say, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=0.0s)]
*  no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=3.24s)]
*  Well, total BS. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=8.32s)]
*  Now that the disastrous budget bill, and we know how bad it is, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=9.8s)]
*  has made its way through the Senate Finance Committee, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=13.72s)]
*  let's just say it looks very, very different, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=17.12s)]
*  whether they're directly screwing Mike Johnson, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=19.48s)]
*  or this was all part of the fraud to begin with. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=22.56s)]
*  Well, there's nothing at all in this new version, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=25.48s)]
*  at least in the Senate, about no tax on Social Security. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=27.96s)]
*  Remember, no tax on tips and no tax on overtime? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=31.28s)]
*  Well, those are so extremely curtailed [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=36.040000000000006s)]
*  with all of these exceptions, as they're not really anything [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=38.6s)]
*  that Donald Trump or Mike ever said was going to exist. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=42.72s)]
*  So just more defrauding of the American people. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  I also want to talk just how this disastrous budget bill [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  is hurting the economy more broadly. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=52.88s)]
*  But of course, as you know, it's a direct attack on health care. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=55.64s)]
*  The more than 15 million Americans [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=59.2s)]
*  could be losing their health care. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=60.96s)]
*  It's an attack on Medicaid, on SNAP, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=62.56s)]
*  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, on housing. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=65.04s)]
*  Just even watch how Fox is describing the changes [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  from the Senate Finance Committee to what MAGA Mike [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=74.0s)]
*  and the MAGA Republicans in the House claim existed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=77.84s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=80.2s)]
*  The House's massive tax and spending bill [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=81.2s)]
*  fresh off the printer, that was Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=83.4s)]
*  Republican, telling Fox Business this morning, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=86.8s)]
*  the President's big, beautiful bill [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=89.48s)]
*  will barely scratch the surface [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=91.24s)]
*  when it comes to shrinking the annual deficit, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=93.12s)]
*  because the slices in spending are minuscule [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=95.68s)]
*  compared to the huge mountain of debt [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=98.76s)]
*  the country owes as he sees it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=100.32s)]
*  Not only does the Senate want to raise the debt ceiling [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=102.52s)]
*  by $5 trillion, the other key changes in this version [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=105.16s)]
*  versus the House include Medicaid cuts [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=108.92s)]
*  from 6% to 3.5% by 2031. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=111.44000000000001s)]
*  The SALT deduction cap has been extended back down [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  to $10,000 versus the House's proposal, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=118.36s)]
*  which raises it to $40,000. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=121.12s)]
*  A two-year phase-out of clean energy credits [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=124.0s)]
*  versus the House repealing tax credit projects [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  that don't begin within 60 days, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=128.52s)]
*  and raising the child tax credit to $2,200 [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=130.56s)]
*  through the 2020 tax year versus the House, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=134.28s)]
*  raising it to a maximum of $2,500. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=137.44s)]
*  The GOP senators joining Rand Paul in his disdain [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  of the bill include Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  and Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  although for different reasons. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  You know who also seems to have gotten utterly screwed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  by the Senate? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  Those New York Congress members like Mike Lawler, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=153.28s)]
*  who said that the SALT cap would have to be raised [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=157.44s)]
*  to $40,000, and now under the Senate version, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=162.16s)]
*  it's back down to 10, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=167.68s)]
*  and now they're basically saying, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=169.24s)]
*  what are you gonna do, Lawler? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=170.4s)]
*  You're gonna vote against it? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  You're gonna vote against it? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=173.0s)]
*  I mean, they just keep exposing that guy all the time. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=174.28s)]
*  And you wanna hear how they're basically framing [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=177.56s)]
*  the issue of whether or not [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  you're gonna lose your Medicaid or not? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Basically, I just remember back in the days [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=184.88s)]
*  where they would talk about the Republicans [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=187.32000000000002s)]
*  with death panels, and they would say that these panels [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=189.88s)]
*  would decide who lives and who dies. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=193.24s)]
*  They're basically doing versions of that, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=195.0s)]
*  except now it's a reality TV version. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=196.68s)]
*  You have Dr. Oz, and he basically says that, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=199.4s)]
*  you need to demonstrate to me, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=202.72s)]
*  you wanna help this country, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=204.96s)]
*  and if I think you're not helping the country, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  you lose your Medicaid. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=208.52s)]
*  Here, listen to him in his own words. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=209.56s)]
*  Here, play the clip. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=210.8s)]
*  Demonstrate that you are trying your hardest [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  to help this country be greater [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  by at least trying to fill some of the jobs [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  that we have open, and by doing that, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=216.72s)]
*  you earn the right to be on Medicaid. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=218.0s)]
*  You earn the right to live, or I decide if you die. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=220.16s)]
*  I mean, let's bring in Michael Linden. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=223.56s)]
*  Michael, formerly at the Office of Management and Budget, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=227.32s)]
*  senior advisor. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=231.0s)]
*  You now are the director of an organization, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=232.8s)]
*  families over billionaires. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=235.24s)]
*  This bill, disastrous as it is in the House, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=237.88s)]
*  seems even more disastrous now [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=241.96s)]
*  that the Senate Finance Committee [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=243.72s)]
*  has put out its high-level points. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=245.36s)]
*  What do you make of it all? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=247.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=249.0s)]
*  I mean, we should step back here for a minute [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  and just remind ourselves what we're talking about here. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=252.52s)]
*  So the House bill was very bad. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=254.96s)]
*  The Senate bill would be even worse. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=256.76s)]
*  But at the core of this bill [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=258.72s)]
*  is a couple of really important things [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=261.0s)]
*  for people to understand. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=263.8s)]
*  First of all, massive cuts to healthcare. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  You heard Dr. Oz talk about, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=267.48s)]
*  he calls it healthcare reform. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=269.08s)]
*  That's an interesting way to describe [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=271.72s)]
*  kicking 16 million people off of their health insurance, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=273.56s)]
*  and that's what these plans would do. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  You have massive cuts to nutrition assistance, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=280.48s)]
*  mainly food stamps, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=283.48s)]
*  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=284.68s)]
*  Three million people are gonna lose their food assistance. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  We're not talking about generous benefits as it is. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  These are people who make do with basically $6 a day [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  in food assistance. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=298.6s)]
*  And then what happens to that money? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=300.16s)]
*  That's about a trillion dollars in cuts [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=302.16s)]
*  over the next 10 years. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=304.8s)]
*  What happens to that money? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=305.72s)]
*  Well, it goes to partially pay for giant tax cuts, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=306.8s)]
*  most of which go to people at the very, very top. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=311.2s)]
*  That's the basic math of this bill. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=313.48s)]
*  People lose healthcare, pay more for healthcare, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=317.64s)]
*  lose food assistance, pay more for food, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=321.04s)]
*  pay more for energy, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=323.40000000000003s)]
*  all so that people at the very top [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=325.32s)]
*  can get another tax cut. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=327.04s)]
*  The Senate bill does not fix any of those things. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=329.64s)]
*  It makes it worse. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=333.22s)]
*  Their cuts to Medicaid are deeper and more painful [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=334.38s)]
*  than the House version. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=338.5s)]
*  Their tax cuts for rich people are bigger [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=340.06s)]
*  and more ridiculous, frankly, than the House version. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=343.74s)]
*  So if anybody was hoping that the Senate would moderate [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=348.54s)]
*  the incredibly extreme House version, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=353.26s)]
*  they were really mistaken. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=355.9s)]
*  They were really mistaken. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=357.98s)]
*  Michael, I remember they used to, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=360.42s)]
*  the MAGA Republicans before they were MAGA [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=363.3s)]
*  and they were whatever they were, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=366.14s)]
*  Tea Party or before they were in the building. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=367.09999999999997s)]
*  They were trickled down. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=368.86s)]
*  They at least tried to pitch it of like, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=370.18s)]
*  if you help the billionaires [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=373.62s)]
*  and basically give welfare for the billionaires, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=375.84s)]
*  they're gonna be so gracious with their purchases [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=379.14s)]
*  of G6 jets and yachts and mansions [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=382.5s)]
*  that eventually you'll get a little bit trickled down on you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=386.82s)]
*  They're not even necessarily even going [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=391.46s)]
*  with that hook anymore. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=393.53999999999996s)]
*  They kind of leave it with, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=394.85999999999996s)]
*  you're gonna help the billionaires [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=397.26s)]
*  and you're gonna like it and shut the F up. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=399.7s)]
*  Just shut the hell up and just be quiet. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=403.46s)]
*  They deserve it, you don't. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=406.29999999999995s)]
*  That's kind of where we're at now. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=407.82s)]
*  Yeah, it is kind of, I mean, they know, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=409.17999999999995s)]
*  they actually know that the American people [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=411.53999999999996s)]
*  don't buy trickled down at all. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=413.58s)]
*  They've tried it, they tried that argument. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=415.9s)]
*  They've tried it so many times. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=417.7s)]
*  They tried it under George W. Bush. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=419.21999999999997s)]
*  They tried it under Trump the first time [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=421.28s)]
*  and it never works. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=423.44s)]
*  It never works economically. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=425.35999999999996s)]
*  That's really important. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=426.76s)]
*  And most Americans understand that in their bones [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=427.84s)]
*  that when you give a tax break to people at the top, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=430.64s)]
*  it does not cascade down to everybody else. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=432.96s)]
*  It just makes the rich richer at everybody else's expense. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=435.23999999999995s)]
*  And this time you're so right. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=438.78s)]
*  The policy hasn't changed. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=440.55999999999995s)]
*  They are still bestowing huge tax cuts [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=442.65999999999997s)]
*  on the largest corporations in America, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=445.9s)]
*  the richest people in the planet. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=448.2s)]
*  But they're not even arguing [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=450.7s)]
*  that that's gonna do any good, right? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=452.82s)]
*  They are, cause they know that argument doesn't work. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=454.65999999999997s)]
*  So they're just trying to pretend that that's not happening. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=457.18s)]
*  And instead say, you know, we have so much waste [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=460.32s)]
*  and fraud or abuse in these programs. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=464.4s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=466.53999999999996s)]
*  They don't even argue that these people [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=467.38s)]
*  need these tax cuts anymore because they know [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=469.3s)]
*  that is an argument that completely falls on deaf ears. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=472.18s)]
*  So instead they're just trying to distract and say, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=474.9s)]
*  no, no, no, we're not cutting taxes for them. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=478.42s)]
*  We're cutting taxes for you. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=481.26s)]
*  But as you pointed out at the very front, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=483.22s)]
*  all the tax cuts that they say are for, you know, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=486.02000000000004s)]
*  middle income people or working people [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=488.90000000000003s)]
*  are either absent from the bill [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=490.82s)]
*  or dramatically paired back from what was promised. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=493.1s)]
*  Can you imagine if Donald Trump had ran on no tax on tips, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=497.22s)]
*  but only for a few years and only a certain amount of tips [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=502.34000000000003s)]
*  and only in a particular set of industries? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=504.74s)]
*  Like that's not a particularly compelling slogan, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=507.32s)]
*  but that's what the policy is. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=511.64s)]
*  And on the other hand, the tax cuts for the super wealthy [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=513.0s)]
*  are incredibly generous and you know, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=517.58s)]
*  nobody has to jump through hoops [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=520.16s)]
*  to get their billionaire tax break. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=522.04s)]
*  But if you're a working person, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=524.24s)]
*  you've got to prove that you deserve it [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=525.72s)]
*  in the words of Dr. Oz. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=529.12s)]
*  And then the very just nature of tips [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=532.64s)]
*  versus creating an overall economic system [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=537.64s)]
*  where Americans could be able to afford their homes [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=541.26s)]
*  if they worked a job without having to worry about, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=545.6999999999999s)]
*  will I get to, how about if your company [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=549.28s)]
*  and your boss provides you with the wages, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=551.64s)]
*  is it a crazy radical concept? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=554.48s)]
*  I must be a crazy leftist here. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=556.12s)]
*  That you get paid wages for working a job [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=557.84s)]
*  that allows you to live a life of dignity [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=561.4s)]
*  in the wealthiest country in the world. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=564.76s)]
*  And here's the thing, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=568.16s)]
*  and I don't think this is a radical concept. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  And push back on me if you think I'm wrong here, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=572.16s)]
*  you know how the way you deal with this all, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=576.0799999999999s)]
*  you tax rich people a little bit more. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=577.78s)]
*  Or first you start off with making sure rich people [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=580.24s)]
*  are taxed fairly and they're not dodging their taxes [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=583.68s)]
*  and they pay their accurate taxes that they owed. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=587.48s)]
*  And then you know what you say, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=590.2s)]
*  well, under this budget bill, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=591.88s)]
*  someone who makes over $4.2 million [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=593.5200000000001s)]
*  gets an extra $400,000 bonus [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=596.36s)]
*  while someone making under 50,000 loses $1,000. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=598.72s)]
*  Maybe if we just looked at that and go, you know what, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=602.24s)]
*  the people making over $4.2 million, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=604.76s)]
*  that $400,000, is that gonna be life or death [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=607.24s)]
*  for that person? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=611.72s)]
*  Or we'll taking the $1,000 away [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=613.1s)]
*  for the person making under $50,000. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=615.2800000000001s)]
*  By the way, not only impact and harm, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=618.1s)]
*  but then result in systemic problems [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=620.9200000000001s)]
*  that are also going to hurt the person [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=623.24s)]
*  making more than $4.2 million [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=625.7s)]
*  and how it's gonna impact our society holistically [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=627.9200000000001s)]
*  that you're end up gonna be paying for it anyway. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=630.5600000000001s)]
*  It's actually, and I hope I'm not oversimplifying it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=632.96s)]
*  It sounds like an easy solve. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=637.0400000000001s)]
*  If you wanna fix this, I don't like having debt. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=638.72s)]
*  I don't like having deficit. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=641.2800000000001s)]
*  You know how you address the tax rich people [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=642.8000000000001s)]
*  a little bit more unfairly. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=644.6s)]
*  That's, you're not wrong. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=646.2s)]
*  And it's actually that simple. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=647.88s)]
*  I think there's two important points [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=649.7199999999999s)]
*  that people need to really understand here. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  First of all, exactly as you described the bill [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=653.56s)]
*  is exactly right. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=656.8s)]
*  The bill literally takes money out of the pockets [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=658.1999999999999s)]
*  of low and middle income people [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  and gives it to rich people. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=662.88s)]
*  That is totally backwards from an economic standpoint, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=664.64s)]
*  from a moral standpoint, from a budgetary standpoint. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=670.16s)]
*  And it's also unprecedented. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=675.04s)]
*  It's actually not something [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=677.46s)]
*  that this country typically does. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=678.9000000000001s)]
*  There's been a bunch of analyses out recently [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=681.1800000000001s)]
*  that looked at this tax and budget bill [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=683.58s)]
*  compared to previous tax and budget bills. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=685.98s)]
*  And yes, there have been bills in the past [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=688.38s)]
*  like the Bush tax cuts or the Trump tax cuts from 2017 [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=690.1800000000001s)]
*  that disproportionately benefited the wealthy [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=694.02s)]
*  compared to what the benefits were [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=697.14s)]
*  for poor people or middle income people. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=698.74s)]
*  Rich people got a bigger benefit. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=700.74s)]
*  But this is the first time in modern history [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=703.36s)]
*  that the bill will explicitly and directly [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=705.86s)]
*  make people's lives worse [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=708.62s)]
*  so that they can pay for tax cuts for people at the top. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=710.62s)]
*  That is so crazy that it's kind of sound, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=713.5400000000001s)]
*  when you tell people that, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=719.6600000000001s)]
*  they think that can't really be what it's doing. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=720.7800000000001s)]
*  Why would anybody do that? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=722.9000000000001s)]
*  But that is exactly what this is doing. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=723.94s)]
*  And you are exactly right. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=726.22s)]
*  This is an easy fix. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=728.38s)]
*  We just need to not cut taxes for rich people. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=730.22s)]
*  If we just didn't cut taxes for rich people in this bill, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=733.54s)]
*  you could do all the tax cuts [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=737.14s)]
*  that these people are proposing [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=739.6999999999999s)]
*  for middle income people and poor people, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=742.2199999999999s)]
*  and there aren't that many of them, or more, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=744.14s)]
*  and you can still get rid of the cuts [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=747.3199999999999s)]
*  to healthcare and food assistance, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=749.54s)]
*  and you'd have the same overall cost. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=752.5799999999999s)]
*  And if you asked rich people [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=754.54s)]
*  to just pay a little bit more of their fair share [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=755.98s)]
*  to give back just a portion of the tax cuts [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=758.3399999999999s)]
*  that they've received over the last 25 years, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=761.52s)]
*  we could do a whole lot more. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=764.56s)]
*  We could invest in people's education, in their healthcare, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=765.8s)]
*  we could reduce the deficit, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=768.74s)]
*  we could do all of those things. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=770.0s)]
*  In this country, there are billionaires [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=771.9399999999999s)]
*  who pay a lower tax rate, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=775.16s)]
*  a lower share of their income in taxes [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=777.12s)]
*  than a teacher or a firefighter, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=780.12s)]
*  or a garbage worker, or a factory worker. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=782.04s)]
*  That is absolutely indefensible. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=785.88s)]
*  And this bill will make that worse. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=790.34s)]
*  And by the way, that is not something [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=792.22s)]
*  that is particularly partisan. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=794.4200000000001s)]
*  Most Republican voters do not wanna cut taxes [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=796.1600000000001s)]
*  for rich people or cut Medicaid. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=798.94s)]
*  Most Republican voters think it's completely ridiculous [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=801.1600000000001s)]
*  that the rich are paying lower tax rates [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=804.4s)]
*  in many cases than the middle class. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=806.9200000000001s)]
*  So the fix is easy if you had politicians in Washington [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=808.98s)]
*  who were not looking out only for the interests [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=814.9000000000001s)]
*  of the super wealthy and giant corporations. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=818.1s)]
*  Here's the thing I think though, right? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=820.58s)]
*  This process is complicated, the budget process. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=822.02s)]
*  It's not like a simple concept. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=825.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, already it's pretty confusing. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=827.7s)]
*  It's like, wait a minute, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=829.48s)]
*  I thought they passed the budget for months ago. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=830.98s)]
*  No, that was just the outline. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=833.14s)]
*  And then they did this, and then what was that? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=835.0600000000001s)]
*  Then they voted on cloture. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=837.1s)]
*  What the hell is cloture? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=838.4200000000001s)]
*  And then there's this committee, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=839.82s)]
*  and then there's a rules markup, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=841.1s)]
*  and then the House voted. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=842.94s)]
*  And then some people are like, wait, isn't that a law? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=844.74s)]
*  No, that's just the House. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=847.06s)]
*  Now you're bringing it back to the Senate, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=848.5s)]
*  but wasn't there already a reconciliation? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=850.14s)]
*  No, that was just a reconciliation on the outline. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=852.4799999999999s)]
*  And now the Senate's looking at what they passed [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=855.0999999999999s)]
*  with the rules committee marked up. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=857.6199999999999s)]
*  And so I think that by the time you get through the process, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=859.38s)]
*  and this is what I think the Republicans are hoping, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=864.02s)]
*  that people don't really know what the hell is going on. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=866.6199999999999s)]
*  You layer on top of that 30 other distractions [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=869.6199999999999s)]
*  that are now taking place, and very serious ones. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=872.6999999999999s)]
*  And before you know it, you have this disastrous budget [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=875.76s)]
*  that goes into effect. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=879.76s)]
*  People start losing their healthcare. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=881.72s)]
*  And then what they have to do, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=883.6800000000001s)]
*  or they start getting impacted, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=886.24s)]
*  then they just gotta play the blame game. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=888.12s)]
*  Divide us as Americans along cultural lines. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=890.4s)]
*  Start really injecting back, oh, transgender this, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=893.88s)]
*  and you're angry at this. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=898.0s)]
*  Split us up, and then rinse, repeat. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=899.44s)]
*  Democrat comes in, fix it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=902.86s)]
*  Blame the firefighter for putting out the arson. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=905.16s)]
*  The arsonist come back in, relight the fire. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=908.0s)]
*  How do we get out of this cycle, Michael? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=910.96s)]
*  That's what I guess my... [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=912.6s)]
*  That's your question, that's your simple question. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=915.16s)]
*  How do we fix American politics? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=917.44s)]
*  Well, here's how I think we do it. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=921.16s)]
*  And it's a very self-serving answer. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=922.88s)]
*  But I'll give you the final word, though. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=925.08s)]
*  I think to create, no one's having the conversations [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=926.96s)]
*  that you and I are having here on corporate news, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=930.6s)]
*  like no one's getting into the guts of this thing [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=933.76s)]
*  and explaining it. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=936.24s)]
*  And frankly, I believe I'm explaining it [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=937.52s)]
*  from a nonpartisan basis, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=939.4s)]
*  because I don't think that red state voters [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=940.78s)]
*  should be screwed by this. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=943.4s)]
*  I don't think blue state voters. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=944.3399999999999s)]
*  But I think the key is educating people [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=945.4599999999999s)]
*  on what's really happening. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=947.8399999999999s)]
*  Let them understand the process, and let them know, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=949.12s)]
*  you're being screwed, you're the mark. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=952.0s)]
*  And probably if you're a red state voter, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=954.8399999999999s)]
*  you're getting hurt even, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=956.8199999999999s)]
*  you're probably getting way more hurt than I am. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=958.1999999999999s)]
*  That's the reality. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=960.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think you're right. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=962.04s)]
*  I think, look, we have a long list of problems [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=964.64s)]
*  in this country. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=968.52s)]
*  And the economy that does not work for most people [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=969.8s)]
*  is underneath a lot of it, not all of it, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=974.8s)]
*  but a big chunk of it. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=977.6999999999999s)]
*  And I think your intuition is right, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=979.4s)]
*  that regardless of where you live or who you voted for, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=982.26s)]
*  you probably do not think it is a good idea [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=985.64s)]
*  to take people's healthcare away [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=988.42s)]
*  in order to pay for tax cuts for rich people. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=990.0799999999999s)]
*  This bill is so unbelievably unpopular, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=992.6s)]
*  including among Republicans and independent voters, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=995.44s)]
*  precisely for that reason. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=998.4000000000001s)]
*  Yes, people are angry at a lot of things. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1000.0s)]
*  We have a lot going on in the world. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1002.24s)]
*  There's lots of bad things in the world. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1003.6s)]
*  I don't wanna pretend that there's not. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1005.1600000000001s)]
*  But I also think there is actually [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1008.34s)]
*  a pretty broad general consensus [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1010.2s)]
*  that the federal government should be on the side [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1013.1800000000001s)]
*  of working people, of people who are struggling to get by, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1015.9200000000001s)]
*  of people who are doing their best [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1019.2s)]
*  and playing by the rules and not on the side [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1020.62s)]
*  of corporations who ship jobs overseas [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1023.26s)]
*  or billionaires who just happen to be [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1025.78s)]
*  the biggest campaign donors. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1027.42s)]
*  And there is an opportunity here, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1029.42s)]
*  and maybe this terrible budget bill [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1031.98s)]
*  will be the spark of that opportunity [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1033.66s)]
*  for people to see in each other that common goal [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1035.96s)]
*  of having our government be on our side [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1040.58s)]
*  and not on the side of some billionaire [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1043.9s)]
*  who just can pay the most to the, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1046.78s)]
*  whatever the latest Mar-a-Lago dinner is. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1051.1s)]
*  I do hope that the stakes of this fight are so real, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1054.54s)]
*  so many people will be hurt. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1062.06s)]
*  People will lose their insurance. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1064.22s)]
*  People will pay more for their insurance. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1065.62s)]
*  People will not have food on the table. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1067.3799999999999s)]
*  I hope that the stakes of this fight [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1070.74s)]
*  will focus us all together on what we share. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1072.3s)]
*  We share a desire for an economy [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1077.54s)]
*  that actually delivers for everyday people [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1079.46s)]
*  and a government that can stand [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1082.3s)]
*  on the side of everyday people. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1083.74s)]
*  That's not what's happening here, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1085.1399999999999s)]
*  despite what the rhetoric was [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1086.54s)]
*  of the Republicans who got elected. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1089.34s)]
*  They ran on working for working people. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1091.1s)]
*  That's what they ran on, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1094.94s)]
*  lowering costs and giving people a little breathing room. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1096.7s)]
*  And the first thing they do is turn around [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1099.3s)]
*  and cut healthcare to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1101.46s)]
*  I think if we can all have a conversation [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1104.58s)]
*  and honest conversation about that, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1107.38s)]
*  I think it could make a difference in the long run. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1108.6200000000001s)]
*  This is a big, long process. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1110.8600000000001s)]
*  And you're right, they're gonna turn around [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1112.82s)]
*  and try to point the blame wherever they can [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1115.42s)]
*  and change the subject. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1117.46s)]
*  But people's healthcare is their number one subject, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1120.6200000000001s)]
*  is everybody's number one subject, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1123.94s)]
*  their health, their family, their bottom lines. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1125.38s)]
*  And this bill just, it takes a sledgehammer to all of that. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1128.38s)]
*  But hey, we've got gigantic flag polls [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1131.82s)]
*  going up in the White House. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1134.66s)]
*  Huge, massive flag polls that are being there. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB25yggx9E&t=1135.86s)]
