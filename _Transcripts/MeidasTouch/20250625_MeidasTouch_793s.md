# MAGA Mike gets BACKSTABBED by his OWN PARTY in Senate
**MeidasTouch:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU)
*  Maga Mike Johnson is under fire from his own political party, the so-called moderates, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=0.0s)]
*  Maga Republicans, I'm not really sure that exists. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=7.44s)]
*  They sent a letter yesterday to the Senate Majority Leader and Maga Mike Johnson, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=10.24s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Thune and Maga Mike Johnson, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=16.56s)]
*  basically saying what the Senate is doing with the budget bill is a total betrayal. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=19.28s)]
*  You've made it worse. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=25.12s)]
*  How you can make it much worse, but the Senate Finance Committee [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=26.72s)]
*  managed to make it much, much worse. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=30.72s)]
*  But there's nothing, there's no low about what Maga Mike Johnson will say or not say. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=33.12s)]
*  Maga Mike Johnson mocked millions of Americans who could lose health care and says, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=39.76s)]
*  hey, you just need to be doing something constructive with your life. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=44.16s)]
*  If you're going to be on the public wagon and you're able, you should try to help pull it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=48.08s)]
*  All we did was put in there, as you all know, a 20-hour work week requirement per week. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=54.24s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=59.68s)]
*  They're complaining about that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  You either have to be working, you got to be looking for a job in a job training program [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  or volunteering for your community. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=66.4s)]
*  For heaven's sake, do something constructive. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=68.08s)]
*  How about Maga Mike Johnson, you do something constructive because there ain't no work really [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=70.64s)]
*  coming out of that House of Representatives other than taking away people's Medicaid and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=75.36s)]
*  basically rubber stamping whatever Donald Trump wants. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=80.64s)]
*  Let me just share this with you all here. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=83.68s)]
*  This is Maga Mike Johnson. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=85.68s)]
*  This is how they try to frame it on the propaganda of Fox where Maga Mike Johnson is asked, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=87.28s)]
*  what do you say to the Democrats that are pushing this narrative? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=93.76s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  It was a ridiculous question to ask. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=98.48s)]
*  That's not true that Republicans are cutting Medicare and Medicaid. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  It's literally in the bill that it cuts Medicaid and Medicare and risks people social security. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=103.76s)]
*  But go on, Maga Mike, let's play. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  And what do you say to the Democrats that are pushing this narrative? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=112.88s)]
*  That's not true that Republicans are cutting Medicare and Medicaid. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=116.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's of course nonsense. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=120.8s)]
*  We had their ads taken down when they began to claim that early on in the process. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=122.64s)]
*  We are not cutting Medicaid. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=126.8s)]
*  We are strengthening the program for the people that desperately need it and deserve it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=128.8s)]
*  The populations that Medicaid is intended to help, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=133.28s)]
*  and that's the elderly and the disabled and young pregnant women, for example. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=135.84s)]
*  So what we're doing is... [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=139.6s)]
*  Then Maga Mike, riddle me this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  Why did your own party send a letter to you and Senator Thune saying that [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=144.32s)]
*  they are very alarmed at what the Senate is doing and it's going to make the budget bill even worse? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=152.64s)]
*  Then you have Maga Mike brazenly lying again and saying, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  we're not cutting Medicaid. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=161.12s)]
*  We're strengthening it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=162.64s)]
*  Just listen to whatever Trump says. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=163.68s)]
*  He never lies, does he? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=165.12s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=166.32s)]
*  You've got a number of provisions. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=167.6s)]
*  We want to make sure that we hold by our commitment that we are not cutting Medicaid. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=169.52s)]
*  The president has said that and I've said that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=174.24s)]
*  We've all said that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=176.0s)]
*  We are strengthening the program for the people who are the most vulnerable populations [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=176.96s)]
*  who really rely upon that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=180.32s)]
*  You're talking about the disabled, the elderly, young pregnant women, for example. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=181.76s)]
*  Oh, got it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  They're helping the most vulnerable, not the billionaires. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=188.24s)]
*  That's where their focus is on. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=192.72s)]
*  You know, and then, you know, you see you've got these Maga Republican senators like [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=195.2s)]
*  Joni Ernst from Iowa. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=200.0s)]
*  And when she's asked about Donald Trump's other kind of betrayal and lie, there's so many of them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=202.64s)]
*  But starting a war in Iran, joining Israel in a war with Iran. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  But then I guess their new statement is war is peace. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  We're not really at war. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=219.04s)]
*  Don't worry about it here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=221.44s)]
*  They do not want to see a war. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=222.48s)]
*  This is not a war. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=224.72s)]
*  This was a strike on a threat to the United States of America. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=226.16s)]
*  I would say as well, this is retribution, Harris, for the thousands of American lives [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=231.6s)]
*  that have been taken by Iran through direct strikes from Iran, as well as their terrorist proxies. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  And. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=244.0s)]
*  Well, apparently, we also learned that the facilities are still largely intact. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=245.44s)]
*  Iran's no longer meeting with the IAEA to cooperate with any oversight into their nuclear arsenal. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=251.44s)]
*  And that if anything, things have gotten much worse. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=258.4s)]
*  I want to focus on how all of these policies are also hurting states like Iowa. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=262.16s)]
*  You saw Joni Ernst there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=268.24s)]
*  And so let me bring in Iowa State Representative J.D. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=269.92s)]
*  Shulton. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=275.12s)]
*  It's running for Senate against Joni Ernst. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=276.16s)]
*  And State Representative Shulton is also a professional baseball player. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=278.8s)]
*  You got the Sioux City professional shirt right there. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  You're at the stadium. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=285.68s)]
*  So let me ask you this question first, though, because when Donald Trump was campaigning, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=286.72s)]
*  he did not know the difference between Sioux City and Sioux Falls. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=292.48s)]
*  And I think, you know, it's it's an important point, though, I think, to bring up, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=297.44s)]
*  which is that Washington does not know about what's actually happening to the farmers in Iowa. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=301.68s)]
*  And to me, it was a really revealing moment if you don't know the difference between Iowa [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=307.84s)]
*  and South Dakota. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=312.08s)]
*  So that revealed a lot to me. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, that's pretty consistent with what we hear from folks out in D.C. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=316.48s)]
*  We're a flyover state. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=320.08s)]
*  And so folks like Donald Trump don't recognize the difference between the two states. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=321.12s)]
*  And the reality is a lot of Iowa has not bounced back since the 2008 economic crisis. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=326.64s)]
*  You have farmers right now that are impacted by the first trade war [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=332.24s)]
*  with that during the first Trump administration. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=336.88s)]
*  A lot of our soybean farmers have lost the market to Brazil. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=340.24s)]
*  And so a lot of folks who are relying on on that for decades of trying to get into that market [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=344.8s)]
*  have now lost it in just a few years. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=352.8s)]
*  And we'll probably never see that again in my lifetime. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=355.68s)]
*  That's the reality. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=358.08s)]
*  You have Joni Ernst out there saying, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=359.84s)]
*  Why are you so focused on the die part of this? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=363.36s)]
*  Like if you die, we're all going to die at some point. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=367.12s)]
*  So like, why do we care? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=371.68s)]
*  You're going to die no matter what. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  And then she goes in front of the cemetery and then she like mocks. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=375.52s)]
*  One, I thought it was so disrespectful to people's resting places, but then also, you know, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=380.08s)]
*  mocking people's fears of dying. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=385.52s)]
*  You know, and I don't like to go into hyperbole and talk about, you know, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=388.8s)]
*  death cult and this and that, but it's like, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  we know that this bill is going to have consequences on people in the state, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=394.8s)]
*  on people's jobs and people's health care. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=399.6s)]
*  And she mocks it and she mocks people dying. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=403.04s)]
*  It's sick. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=405.76000000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=407.04s)]
*  It's so disrespectful of what she said just in that quote unquote apology. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  The reality is, we all are going to die, but we don't have to die. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=412.88000000000005s)]
*  So billionaires can have a bigger tax break. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=416.32000000000005s)]
*  This bill, if passed, is going to devastate a lot of our rural communities. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=419.20000000000005s)]
*  It's going to devastate rural hospitals. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=424.0s)]
*  It's going to devastate rural nursing homes and OB-GYN clinics, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  all of which are already massively consolidated. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  And it's just going to lead to more stress on urban health centers. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=434.16s)]
*  And so this is going to impact all of us, not just kick off millions of millions of Americans [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  and thousands of Iowans off their health care. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=443.04s)]
*  It's also going to hurt all of us because the health care centers are going to close. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=445.76s)]
*  Trump has this schtick where he'll go and travel to a state like Iowa [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=450.4s)]
*  and he'll say, oh, my farmers, I love you, my farmers. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=455.12s)]
*  No one's going to make you better farmers than I'm going to make you. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=459.28s)]
*  You will be the greatest farmers ever. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=462.96s)]
*  You'll be so rich. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=465.52s)]
*  And then he lies and then screws him over. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  He then tries to scramble and figures out if he can get government subsidies [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=470.56s)]
*  to cover losses that are caused by the trade wars that he starts as kind of temporary band-aids [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=475.28s)]
*  on a solution that's unsustainable and actually building the wealth that [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=482.96s)]
*  farmers deserve in a state like Iowa. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=487.52s)]
*  So I guess, how do you win? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=490.4s)]
*  And how does that work? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, look, to your point, when people think about Iowa, I think from D.C., [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  they try to, you know, they view it as a flyover. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=504.08s)]
*  They view it like this and that. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=507.59999999999997s)]
*  The people in Iowa are smart. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=509.2s)]
*  I see the people out there in Iowa protesting at no kings and it seems that they get it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=511.28s)]
*  So how do we translate, though? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=518.0799999999999s)]
*  Like, how do we get people to say, no, no, no, I know he's saying that, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=520.64s)]
*  but he's screwing you every time he does this. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=525.04s)]
*  He does that, then he screws you. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=527.6s)]
*  Wake up. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, it was interesting when I ran for Congress. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=530.56s)]
*  We got retweeted by farmers and ranchers for Trump. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=533.12s)]
*  You'd see that in their little bio and everything. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=536.48s)]
*  And a lot of it because I took strong stances against anti-monopoly [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=539.04s)]
*  and enforcing our antitrust laws and having new ones. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  I've talked to farmers who will always vote for me and ones who will never vote for me [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=547.36s)]
*  and everywhere in between. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=550.48s)]
*  And when you convey that, they know they're being squeezed. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=551.76s)]
*  They know on the input side when it comes to seeds and fertilizer and those costs, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  they're getting squeezed by a huge multinational corporation. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=560.0s)]
*  They know on the market side, they're being squeezed by a multinational corporation. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=562.64s)]
*  You have JBS, who Brazilian-owned, very corrupt, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=567.04s)]
*  charged with over $256 million worth of fines because they're so corrupt, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=572.88s)]
*  to give the Trump inauguration $5 million, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=579.12s)]
*  more than all those billion tech billionaires that were front row and center. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  JBS gave them more for that inauguration. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=586.56s)]
*  Now, the Trump administration is trying to waive some of the laws we have to protect [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=589.8399999999999s)]
*  the Foreign Corruption Act so JBS can have more benefits to them. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=596.2399999999999s)]
*  It's a pay-to-play situation. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=600.0799999999999s)]
*  And this is something that we need to talk about because farmers feel this. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=601.76s)]
*  I think COVID put a huge spotlight on this. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=606.3199999999999s)]
*  You had farmers getting squeezed. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=608.56s)]
*  You have workers working in suppressed, dangerous situations. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=611.12s)]
*  You have the consumer paying the most they ever have for things like meat [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=615.1999999999999s)]
*  and different things like that. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=619.12s)]
*  And then you have these huge multinational corporations [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=620.64s)]
*  bragging about the record profits they have, all that happening at the same time. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=623.52s)]
*  And so I think if we're going to win in rural America or compete in rural America, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=629.52s)]
*  you have to talk about things like that, at least in the Midwest. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=634.96s)]
*  One of the things that I try to say too is that farmers are so integral to our country. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=638.96s)]
*  The very fabric of our country is built on farmers. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=646.64s)]
*  And I always say that really what Donald Trump and MAGA and people like to me, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  journey errands are doing is they're using farmers as props. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=655.36s)]
*  And by the way, I understand at some level that it's exciting to be on TV [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=660.0s)]
*  and to have the shiny lights on you and to have someone who is the president or whatever [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=666.72s)]
*  put their arm around you. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=674.16s)]
*  But the question is this, as you look back at Trump's 2016 campaign, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=676.4s)]
*  as you look at what he's doing now in 2024, you always ask, are you better off? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=681.52s)]
*  And it just seems that over and over again, farmers are used by Washington, by Trump, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=687.4399999999999s)]
*  to get the photo op of himself next to someone who looks like a farmer, who's out there. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  And so Trump can say, you see, look at me, I care about these people. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=702.64s)]
*  And then they not only disappear, then they undercut the market by going to Brazil [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=706.72s)]
*  or China or elsewhere and throw the American farmers under the bus. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=711.76s)]
*  I'll give you the final word on what you think our audience needs to know. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=716.24s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=720.64s)]
*  That's why we talk about fight, fix, secure every single day. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=722.1600000000001s)]
*  Fight for universal health care, fix the economy so it works for everyone, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=725.36s)]
*  not just the billionaires and the multinational corporations, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=728.8s)]
*  and secure our democracy from the billionaires and special interests that are dictating things. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeUwbzC9PU&t=732.4s)]
