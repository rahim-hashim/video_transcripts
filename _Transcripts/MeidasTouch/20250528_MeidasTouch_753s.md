# Trump SPIRALS in PUBLIC after Getting HUMILIATED by Canada
**MeidasTouch:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg)
*  There's Donald Trump flipping out in public because he can be so easily baited. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=0.0s)]
*  The speech from the throne by King Charles in Canada set Donald Trump off, so Donald [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=6.46s)]
*  Trump's gotta go talk about conquering Canada again and taking it over and threatening its [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  sovereignty. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=19.18s)]
*  Donald Trump was humiliated by King Charles' brilliant yet subtle, or I would say not so [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=20.34s)]
*  subtle, jabs at Donald Trump. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=27.88s)]
*  Canada is true, north and free, and now more united with ever, with the Commonwealth nations, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=31.24s)]
*  with the European Union and others, over the United States of America. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=38.32s)]
*  So what does Donald Trump say? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  Here's what he posts. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=44.8s)]
*  I told Canada, which very much wants to be part of our fabulous Golden Dome system, that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=45.8s)]
*  But it will cost $61 billion if they remain a separate but unequal nation, but will cost [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=52.64s)]
*  $0 if they become our cherished 51st state. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=60.08s)]
*  They are considering the offer! [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=65.26s)]
*  You see the dog whistles there as well where they go separate but unequal. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=68.3s)]
*  I think you gotta pick out the subtleties of the things that Donald Trump, not so subtleties [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=72.84s)]
*  of the things that Donald Trump says as well. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  As our editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski writes, since I speak fluent Trump, let me explain [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=79.8s)]
*  this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=84.96s)]
*  Trump announced his Golden Dome thing without checking with Canada. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=85.96s)]
*  He can't do it without Canada's cooperation. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=89.6s)]
*  Now Canada is using it as leverage in trade negotiations. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  So dumbass Trump is clowning to find a way to make it work. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=96.44s)]
*  I've seen memes like this with Prime Minister Carney giving Donald Trump the middle finger. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=102.16s)]
*  How about this headline from Medi-ite? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=108.92s)]
*  King Charles declares Canada strong and free amid Trump's 51st state threats as Carl Kintanilla [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=111.28s)]
*  goes subtle. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  Or this meme right here of everybody just laughing at Donald Trump, former presidents. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=119.72s)]
*  And then he said Canada is going to pay for my Golden Dome. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=125.46000000000001s)]
*  Obviously Prime Minister Carney responded right away. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=131.04s)]
*  Carney spokesperson, Carney couldn't even be bothered to respond to the vile piece of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=134.72s)]
*  filth that Donald Trump is the felon sexual abuser, disgusting criminal and fraud. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=139.1s)]
*  Just let the spokesperson deal with this disgusting thing in the South. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=144.88s)]
*  This is what Prime Minister Carney spokesperson said. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=149.96s)]
*  Canada is an independent sovereign nation and it will remain one. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=152.92s)]
*  The Financial Times headline was, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=158.94s)]
*  By the way, everybody is clowning Donald Trump. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=175.18s)]
*  Xi Jinping clowning Trump in America with statements, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=178.02s)]
*  we really need stability in the world, order Donald. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=182.1s)]
*  I think you should reflect on the position of the United States, right? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=184.62s)]
*  You have China acting the way the United States once acted and United States acting the way [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=189.16s)]
*  China once acted or North Korea now. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=194.46s)]
*  It's frankly North Korea acts more responsibly right now than the United States. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=196.86s)]
*  You have Russian state media just mocking the crap out of Donald Trump's post. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=202.24s)]
*  Donald Trump's post this morning or yesterday morning. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=208.3s)]
*  What Vladimir Putin doesn't realize is that if it weren't for me, lots of really bad things [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=211.56s)]
*  would have already happened to Russia. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=216.8s)]
*  And I mean really bad. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=218.76s)]
*  He's playing with fire! [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  Oh no, you did it in all caps, Donald. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=222.68s)]
*  That's really going to scare Vladimir Putin, who when he took the phone call with you last [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=226.12s)]
*  week, he did it at an elementary school in Southern Russia and he kept on talking about [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=230.8s)]
*  Melania to punk you and to make you feel like a little piece of crap. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=236.6s)]
*  And you thought he was praising you about Melania. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  So you left and you said to everybody, hey everybody, he's talking about Melania and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=245.64s)]
*  what a great reputation he is. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  They're showing Melania nudes on Russian state regime media over and over again. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=252.9s)]
*  And here's how they're talking about you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=258.76s)]
*  This is what RT, Russian TV says. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  Putin Trump warns Moscow, claiming Russia avoided in all caps really bad consequences [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=263.36s)]
*  only thanks to him. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=268.32s)]
*  Putin doesn't realize he's playing with fire. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=270.04s)]
*  Trump's message leaves little room for misinterpretation until he posts the opposite tomorrow morning. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=272.56s)]
*  That is how they're clowning you, Donald. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=279.68s)]
*  Dmitri Medvedev, one of the former leaders of Russia, said the following. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  Regarding Trump's words about Putin playing with fire and really bad things happening [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=286.68s)]
*  I only know of one really bad thing. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=293.12s)]
*  World War III. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=296.48s)]
*  I hope Trump understands this. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=297.48s)]
*  And by the way, Donald Trump, who like in his own mind is like self-fulfilling World [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=300.52000000000004s)]
*  War III because he's so terrified of actually sanctioning Russia and standing up because [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=305.52000000000004s)]
*  Trump is actually a massive coward. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=312.6s)]
*  When you confront this pathetic felon, you just confront him. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=316.16s)]
*  He's weak. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=319.6s)]
*  He is a weak and vile individual. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=320.88s)]
*  He's a felon, a sexual abuser. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=324.12s)]
*  You have to stand up to him. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=326.54s)]
*  The way New York Attorney General Letitia James did. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=328.32s)]
*  The way E. Gene Carroll did. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=331.2s)]
*  The way the people who sued Trump University did when Trump caved. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=333.6s)]
*  Trump is caveman. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=337.92s)]
*  He caves all of the time. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=339.4s)]
*  By the way, the Russian bots then start to swarm Trump's social media when he makes those [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=341.44s)]
*  posts. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=346.56s)]
*  This is what these bots then say to Trump. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=347.56s)]
*  You know in Russia they've got an operation to swarm Trump's post with stuff like this. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=350.0s)]
*  What do you expect Russia to do, Donald? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=354.0s)]
*  A day prior, Ukraine celebrated the largest drone attack against Moscow and tried to destroy [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=355.76s)]
*  his helicopter while he was in it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=360.78s)]
*  Stop supplying military and intelligence aid and watch how quickly this war ends. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  It's up to the US to stop the war by terminating aid. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=366.84s)]
*  I still don't understand why Putin is the bad guy when Zelensky is clearly the dictator. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=370.67999999999995s)]
*  That's what all of the bots were swarming Donald Trump's account and saying. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=376.48s)]
*  You know who nailed it? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=380.6s)]
*  Nailed it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=383.12s)]
*  Well, you know this. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=384.12s)]
*  Hillary Clinton. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=385.12s)]
*  Remember her convention speech where she said, if you can be baited by a freaking tweet, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=386.12s)]
*  what do you think is going to happen with Vladimir Putin? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=391.64000000000004s)]
*  Remember when she said this? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=394.64000000000004s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  If you dare imagine, imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=403.72s)]
*  And then remember in September 2024, Hillary Clinton nailed it again when she was on the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=413.16s)]
*  view. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=419.44000000000005s)]
*  Here's what she said. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=420.44000000000005s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=421.44000000000005s)]
*  He's definitely baitable because he has a very fragile ego that has to be constantly [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=422.44000000000005s)]
*  buttressed and people have to tell him how great he is. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=429.8s)]
*  He has to tell himself how great he is and he has to have people around him who are constantly [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=432.52s)]
*  just giving him all of this emotional support. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=439.0s)]
*  So that Donald Trump spent the whole day spiraling where he would go, other than the rigged presidential [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=444.0s)]
*  election of 2020, the biggest scandal in American history is the auto pen. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=450.0s)]
*  Whoever used the auto pen, auto pen. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=456.24s)]
*  Then he posts things like this, which is very damaging to our country and our economy. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  He goes, our great mortgage agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, provide a vital service [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=464.64s)]
*  to our nation by helping hardworking Americans reach the American dream, home ownership. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=470.06s)]
*  I am working on taking these amazing companies public, but I want to be clear. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=475.79999999999995s)]
*  The US government will keep its implicit guarantees and I will stay strong in my position overseeing [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=480.28s)]
*  them as president. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=485.97999999999996s)]
*  What he means by taking them public, they are already kind of public trust entities [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=487.64s)]
*  right now. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=491.97999999999996s)]
*  He means privatizing them per project 2022. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=492.97999999999996s)]
*  And the reason that they are a government, essentially part of the government right now, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=497.38s)]
*  is because what we saw happen during the housing crisis and we recognize the vulnerabilities [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJBzV5JrjZg&t=503.7s)]
