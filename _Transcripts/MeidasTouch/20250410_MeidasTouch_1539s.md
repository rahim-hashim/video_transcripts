# Trump Witness CRUMBLES Under CROSS-EXAM at Hearings
**MeidasTouch:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos)
*  It did not go well for Donald Trump's top trade representative, Jameson Greer, who testified [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=0.0s)]
*  on Capitol Hill for two days under oath the first day before the United States Senate, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=5.84s)]
*  the second day before the House of Representatives. He spent a day and a half justifying and making [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=11.6s)]
*  every excuse in the book for Donald Trump's tariffs against the world, the cockamamie formula, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=17.84s)]
*  using deficits to calculate reciprocal tariffs, which weren't actually reciprocal tariffs, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=23.68s)]
*  testifying under no circumstance ever. And I mean ever will there be a pause on any of these [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=28.88s)]
*  tariffs. We're all in. If there's 10% inflation, no pause. If millions of jobs get lost, no pause. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=37.2s)]
*  And then on day two of his testimony before the House of Representatives, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=45.44s)]
*  you literally see him getting a text message or a Google alert on his phone. And he has this [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  oh crap moment where he finds out that Donald Trump reversed course on every country other than [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  China. And then Donald Trump essentially paused all of the tariffs against the world. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=63.12s)]
*  Precisely what Jameson Greer testified would never happen. And also because Jameson Greer's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=68.88s)]
*  the top trade representative, this would be like the decision that he makes or should be involved [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=76.32s)]
*  in. And he was finding out that Donald Trump basically made a tweet or a social media post. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=83.52s)]
*  And on that basis, the entire tariff policy shifted in a moment. An entire realignment [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=90.08s)]
*  of United States trade policy took place. And Jameson Greer, the trade representative, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  was finding out in the hearing, this is the chaos of the Trump regime. So then naturally on day two, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=103.36s)]
*  the Democrats pounced and they were asking trade representative Greer, you didn't know about that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=110.4s)]
*  You just spent two days testifying this would never happen. And now that's happening. Explain [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=115.92s)]
*  that to us. And Jameson Greer is like, oh, well, I'm reading the post. And I think that this is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=122.56s)]
*  actually really smart because there's no depth to the excuses and depravity that they won't justify [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=128.08s)]
*  when it comes to Donald Trump. So let's talk about what went down. So first you have Democratic [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=137.92s)]
*  Senator Mark Warner. This is day one when Greer's before the Senate. And Senator Mark Warner just [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=143.28s)]
*  goes off on Jameson Greer saying, why the hell are you, why the hell are you tariffing Australia, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=149.12s)]
*  our ally, when there's a surplus that we have in trade with Australia? That makes no sense under [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=156.16s)]
*  your Kaka Mane Greek formula. Play this clip. There is a trade. We already have a free trade [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=162.8s)]
*  agreement. We have a trade surplus. So getting the least bad, why did they get whacked in the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  first place? We're addressing the $1.2 trillion deficit, the largest in human history that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=175.12s)]
*  President Biden left us with. We should be running up the score in Australia. The question on [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  Australia, they ban or have a trade surplus with Australia. We have a free trade agreement. Why? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  They are incredibly important national security partner. Why were they whacked with a tariff? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=191.84s)]
*  Senator, despite the agreement, they ban our beef, they ban our pork. They're getting ready to impose [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=197.36s)]
*  measures on our digital companies. With your Greek letter formula, the fact that we have a trade [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=202.32s)]
*  surplus. We have a global tariff on every, we're trying to address the $1.2 trillion that Biden [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=207.12s)]
*  left us with. I think that answer, sir, you're a much smarter person than that answer. The idea [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=213.84s)]
*  that we are going to whack friend and foe alike and particularly friends with this level is both, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=220.8s)]
*  I think, insulting the Australians, undermines our national security and frankly makes us not [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=228.96s)]
*  a good partner going forward. The lack of trust from friends and allies based upon [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  this ridiculous policy that goes into full effect at midnight tonight is extraordinary. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=240.24s)]
*  Next, you have Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan and she says to Jameson Greer, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=246.08s)]
*  what if inflation was 10%? Would you still keep these tariffs on here? Play this clip. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  Sales tax is increasing prices for families. It's also causing huge losses in Americans [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=259.44s)]
*  retirement savings. Ambassador Greer, would the administration reverse course if the president's [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=265.44s)]
*  tariffs led to 10% inflation? Senator, the president is fixed in his purpose. This trade [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=271.44s)]
*  deficit and the offshore and loss of manufacturing jobs is something that's persisted for too long [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=279.12s)]
*  and it's dangerous. I understand your justification for the policy, even though there are some very [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=283.92s)]
*  contradictory justifications coming out of the administration. But my question is, what's the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=289.44s)]
*  inflation rate where you guys would reverse course? 10% inflation that I just asked you about, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=294.64s)]
*  is higher inflation than we saw at the peak of the COVID economic crisis. But you aren't going to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=301.52s)]
*  say here today that you would reverse course even if you created inflation as high as we had at the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=307.52s)]
*  peak of the COVID economic crisis. I think the most serious inflation we saw was during the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  Biden administration. When we did tariffs in the first term, inflation went down. It's not going [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=318.4s)]
*  to be a one-to-one inflation about how much money you're putting into the supply. It's not about [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  tariffs and products. Let's just be really clear that the Trump administration is here today to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=327.6s)]
*  say that even if inflation hits Americans' pocketbooks at 10% because of these tariffs, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=331.6s)]
*  then the Trump administration is still going to go charging ahead. So, Ambassador, would the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=338.88s)]
*  administration reverse course if the president's tariffs caused a 50% stock market crash, which [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  would hurt Americans' retirement savings even more than they've been hurt in the last 10 days or so? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=349.76000000000005s)]
*  Senator, the fundamentals of the economy are so strong. We had 228,000 jobs last month. We have [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=356.08s)]
*  9,000 additional manufacturing jobs from the month before. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=362.0s)]
*  So again, your answer is even if the stock market crashes 50%, which is how much the stock market [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=364.16s)]
*  crashed in the Great Recession, you're not going to say here today that you would reverse course [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=370.72s)]
*  even if you crash the stock market and harm retirement savings as drastically as happened [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=376.4s)]
*  during the Great Recession in 2007. Senator, your hypotheticals are not [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=382.64s)]
*  consistent with the history we have seen with the use of tariffs. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=387.28s)]
*  My hypotheticals are based on the fact that a lot of Americans are looking at their 401Ks today [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=389.52s)]
*  and wondering how much of a lifestyle change they are going to have to have or whether they're [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=394.8s)]
*  going to be able to retire when they plan to because of the recklessness and haphazard nature [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=401.2s)]
*  of the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs. Nothing was thought out about this. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=406.64s)]
*  This has been a haphazard, incompetent effort and it's showing. Thank you, Mr. Chair. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=412.4s)]
*  Next up, you have Democratic Senator Cortez Mastro and he or she talks about what are you doing [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=417.84s)]
*  to impact the negative impact on international tourism right now? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=424.88s)]
*  What are you doing to deal with that? Here, play this clip. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=428.96s)]
*  What are you doing about the impact of international tourism and now these blanket [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=434.23999999999995s)]
*  tariffs having a negative impact? What are you doing to address that? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  The whole sentence, Senator, said that we need to get away from government spending as funding [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=440.8s)]
*  our economy and financialization and we need to move to real goods and services, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=445.36s)]
*  including the tourism you're talking about. So what are you doing to impact the negative [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=449.04s)]
*  impact of tourism right now? Well, one thing I'll say is we can't have the status quo, right? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=452.24s)]
*  I keep hearing that we should have essentially what I'm hearing is we should have the status quo. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=456.72s)]
*  We should keep the $1.2 trillion trade deficit that Biden left us with. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=460.48s)]
*  I'm asking you what are you doing in this administration to address [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  now the impact that you're having with these blanket tariffs, not targeted tariffs, blanket [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=469.12s)]
*  tariffs on international tourism that is a big impact for our economy? What are you doing to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=473.68s)]
*  address that? Well, Senator, as we're talking to all of these countries, we are talking about [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=479.04s)]
*  services. We are talking about making sure that we can export services to other countries. A lot [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=483.2s)]
*  of those that we export are digital services. Well, let me say I only have so much time and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=488.72s)]
*  apparently you're not. So here's what I would like because you haven't thought about this [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=494.08s)]
*  and the administration hasn't really thought about it because I haven't heard anybody talking [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=498.4s)]
*  about tourism. So why don't you come talk to me in my office and let's talk about and put a plan [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=501.44s)]
*  together because these blanket tariffs are having an impact on tourism in this in my state and across [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=506.56s)]
*  the country. So instead of just defending it, why don't you just come sit down with some of us and [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  try to address the concerns that we are seeing and feeling in our states that this administration [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=519.1999999999999s)]
*  has not taken into account? I'm happy to come speak with you. Thank you, Senator. Next up, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=525.36s)]
*  you have Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren saying, OK, so what you're saying is that if [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=530.24s)]
*  700,000, a million Americans lose their jobs, you're going to keep these tariffs, you're going to [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=535.76s)]
*  support them? Play this clip. Ambassador Greer, we lost 700,000 jobs each month in the last [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=541.12s)]
*  recession. If 700,000 Americans lose their jobs, will the Trump administration suspend these tariffs? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=549.2s)]
*  Senator, I think the economists who are making these projections, who often are in favor of [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=559.6800000000001s)]
*  fully unfettered free trade, are the same ones who said in the first Trump term that- [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=565.2s)]
*  Mr. Greer, let me just stop you there. I'm not asking about projections. I'm asking if the numbers [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  show that 700,000 people have lost their jobs because of these new tariffs that Trump has slapped [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=575.84s)]
*  on. Will the administration reverse course and lift those tariffs? Senator, that's not going to [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=584.8000000000001s)]
*  happen. We've lost five million manufacturing jobs over the years, which is the number I'm most [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=591.12s)]
*  worried about, and we have to get those jobs back. So I take that as a no. Next up, you have Democratic [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=594.8000000000001s)]
*  Congress member, Lloyd Doggett, and he or he really kind of just drives home this point to [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=600.0s)]
*  James and Greer about the way our economy functioned for 50 years and why America was [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=607.12s)]
*  benefiting under the trade policy as it always existed. Play this clip. The United States has [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=612.8s)]
*  run trade deficits for 48 straight years, during which time the U.S. economy has grown by 255% [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=618.16s)]
*  in real terms. These decades of trade deficits have corresponded with increases in American [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=625.76s)]
*  wealth and household incomes that far exceed the progress in Canada, China, and the European Union. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  Do you think that this growth in American wealth as a result associated with deficits [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=638.72s)]
*  is something that constitutes a national emergency? The giant and massive persistent trade deficit [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=645.52s)]
*  that Biden left us with is an emergency. It's not like the small deficits from the 60s when we had [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=651.84s)]
*  auto workers here making production. We've offshored all this stuff, Mr. Doggett, and we are [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=656.08s)]
*  really in an emergency situation. We're not passing the buck. We seem to have done much better than [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=662.32s)]
*  in the Gilded Age, which the president prefers. I would just say that on the eve of his inauguration, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=667.44s)]
*  the president promised to bring prices drastically down, and there's nothing that you've said in your [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=672.8000000000001s)]
*  answers or non-answers to me today that will give Americans any assurance to believe anything [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=677.44s)]
*  other than that their prices will continue to soar and their savings will continue to shrink. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=682.96s)]
*  The president's lies continue to cost the American people dearly. I yield back. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=688.24s)]
*  Going back to Democratic Senator Cortez Mastro, watch this. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=693.6s)]
*  Be intellectually honest. Now, let me just ask this because this is also true, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=697.5200000000001s)]
*  and I so appreciate my Senator Lankford asking this. Time matters. How long did it take to [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=702.24s)]
*  negotiate that agreement, the USMCA, that you were part of? We did it at breakneck speed. We did in [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=708.0s)]
*  about two years. Two years, and now you're telling us you have nearly 50 countries coming to you, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=712.4s)]
*  approaching you to enter into negotiation, and you think that you can do that overnight? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=719.28s)]
*  India... You're pretty superhuman here, if that's the case. So let's be realistic. That's all we're [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=724.72s)]
*  asking. Common sense. Then you have Democratic Senator Cantwell, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=731.12s)]
*  who she is, a Washington state senator. Play this clip. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=735.68s)]
*  Questions for members. But you can see all my colleagues, we are thoughtful people with specific [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=738.8s)]
*  issues about our constituencies. I just met with raspberry growers. They're concerned. They want [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=743.76s)]
*  to know if they're going to get some seat on a council so they can have their issues heard. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=748.64s)]

*  innovation and trade get you. But you're coming here this morning with this not only tanking of [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=759.28s)]
*  the market and 401s. Now you're coming here telling me that tariff is the tool. And I'm telling you, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=765.4399999999999s)]
*  innovation is the tool. You're telling us in your testimony, you want a tariff on semiconductors. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=771.52s)]
*  I'm saying that the last administration and this organization here passed the Chips and Science Act [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=777.12s)]
*  so we could reshore semiconductors here in the United States. So you're not [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=782.8s)]
*  going to win the innovation economy by tariffing semiconductors and reshoring that. I don't know [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=788.96s)]

*  got to say. Play this clip. I feel like you're in a very bad position here. This whole idea that this [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=902.4000000000001s)]
*  president made this switcheroo on you while you were in the middle of testifying here today. I [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=907.6s)]
*  actually feel bad for you. But I really feel bad for the American people that are seeing these [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=912.1600000000001s)]
*  things happen. There's no plan. I mean, that's my big concern. I know there's goals. I want to see [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=916.72s)]
*  manufacturing brought back to America. Or at least I want to see jobs that pay more money so [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=922.88s)]
*  we can rebuild our middle class in America. I'm for that. I'm for holding China accountable and [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=927.6s)]
*  holding our adversaries accountable. I'm for tariffs in select specific places. But right now, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=933.04s)]
*  there's no... All we know is prices are going up. We're pissing off our allies. And the stock market [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=940.08s)]
*  went down dramatically. It's gone up dramatically today. The market manipulation question by Mr. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=946.64s)]
*  Horsford is a very real concern that we're going to have to dig into a little bit. Who's benefiting [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=951.84s)]
*  from these wild fluctuations down, wild fluctuation up, we're still way down. We need a plan to [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=956.1600000000001s)]
*  accomplish the objectives that I know that you genuinely believe in, which is to try and recreate [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=963.52s)]
*  the middle class here in the United States of America. That on my side of the aisle, we all [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=968.1600000000001s)]
*  believe in that. We have to recreate the middle class in America. And he's so right. Just flipping [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=972.24s)]
*  the policy. Did you even know, Jamison Greer, anything about this? And Democratic congressmember, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=976.72s)]
*  Stephen Horsford brings the point home as well. Let's play this clip. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=982.96s)]
*  Mr. Trade Representative, are you aware that the tariffs have been paused? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=987.52s)]
*  I am, yes. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=993.12s)]
*  When were you made aware of that? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=994.24s)]
*  Well, I understood the decision was made a few minutes ago. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=996.5600000000001s)]
*  And sitting here... [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=998.8000000000001s)]
*  And under discussion. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=999.84s)]
*  Sitting here under discussion. So did you know that this was under discussion and why did you [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1001.2s)]
*  not include that as part of your opening remarks? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1006.0s)]
*  So typically what I don't do is divulge the contents of my discussions with the president. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1008.64s)]
*  What are the details of the pause? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1012.64s)]
*  Well, my understanding is that because so many countries have decided not to retaliate, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1015.44s)]
*  we're going to have about 90 days. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1020.88s)]
*  No, no. Excuse me? China increased their tariffs on the United States. Trump blinked. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1022.4s)]
*  What's the blink, sir? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1033.2s)]
*  What do you know about this pause? What are the details of it? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1034.24s)]
*  Well, the details, as I understand it, is that China continues to retaliate. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1038.0s)]
*  Other countries didn't retaliate. The president two or three days ago said [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1042.56s)]
*  we wanted to negotiate with those countries that asked for meetings. That's what we're doing. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1046.24s)]
*  What are the details? How long is the pause? How many days? How many weeks? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1050.32s)]
*  I understand it's 90 days. I haven't spoken to the president since I've been in the... [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1054.4s)]
*  So the trade representative hasn't spoken to the president of the United States. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1058.16s)]
*  Yes, I have. I've just been in a hearing with you, sir. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1062.8s)]
*  But yet he announced it on a tweet. WTF? Who's in charge? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1064.8s)]
*  Going back to day one, here's Senator Bernie Sanders also pointing out to Jameson Greer. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1070.48s)]
*  Now, like, you guys lie about everything. You're saying that Canada is causing the fentanyl [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1077.84s)]
*  issues in the United States. Like, why would you do that? Why would you do that? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1084.48s)]
*  Why does everything, every freaking word, got to be a lie? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1088.8s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders with the win right here, play this clip. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1093.12s)]
*  President Trump said, Mr. Greer, that he had no choice in terms of Canada. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1096.1599999999999s)]
*  And I live 50 miles away from the Canadian border. He had no choice but to bypass Congress [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1102.1599999999999s)]
*  and to impose an emergency 25% tariff on Canada. He had no choice but to do that. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1107.44s)]
*  He had no choice but to bypass Congress and to impose an emergency 25% tariff on Canada. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1112.8799999999999s)]
*  To stop, quote, the massive, end quote, amount of fentanyl, end quote, the millions and millions [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1119.12s)]
*  of undocumented immigrants coming from the northern border. Unfortunately, that's a lie. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1125.28s)]
*  The truth is that the US Customs and Border Protection reported just 43 pounds of fentanyl [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1132.24s)]
*  was seized at the Canadian border last year, representing just two-tenths of one percent of [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1137.92s)]
*  the total. Further, he said among, he talked about millions and millions of undocumented immigrants [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1143.3600000000001s)]
*  coming from Canada. In fact, last year there were 24,000 people, not millions and millions. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1150.0800000000002s)]
*  First question, really, we can argue about tariffs, but why does the president have to lie [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1154.96s)]
*  all of the time in order to make his point? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1160.88s)]
*  So, Senator, I would just refute that when the president is talking about the nature of the [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1163.44s)]
*  emergency we have. I mean, this is very serious. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1168.0800000000002s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit closer into the mic, please? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1170.48s)]
*  Certainly. Senator, I would just say, I think you need to look at what the president issued in terms [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1171.44s)]
*  of the order for the legal basis for what we're doing, right? I mean, the president very rightly [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1176.24s)]
*  hit on this issue of fentanyl migration coming from northern and southern borders, and it's a [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1181.2s)]
*  real emergency. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1184.48s)]
*  Well, look, drugs are a real emergency. Two-tenths of one percent. You can then argue drugs are [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1185.0400000000002s)]
*  illegal drugs come from every country in the world. If you declare that as an emergency, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1192.96s)]
*  you're giving the president of the United States unbelievable power. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1196.72s)]
*  And let me give some credit here to Republican Senator Tom Tillis from North Carolina, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1199.8400000000001s)]
*  although he knows he's going to be heading into a difficult Senate race. So [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1205.28s)]
*  he's doing this for a reason. Let's be very clear. And so here is North Carolina Republican [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1210.48s)]
*  Tillis questioning the U.S. trade representative, Jameson Greer, on Trump's strategy. This was, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1216.56s)]
*  of course, before Trump changed course within 24 hours. Play this clip. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1223.52s)]
*  I'm not a trade expert, and I'm not going to question it at this point. I do have a question [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1228.6399999999999s)]
*  about at the end of the day, the other thing in management consulting we like to focus on is this [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1233.9199999999998s)]
*  concept of one throat to choke. In other words, when you're finally taking a look at a strategy, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1239.44s)]
*  someone has to own it. And you can't say that it's the president or the vice president. So my first [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1245.84s)]
*  question to you in this scenario, the decision maker who decided the all a prima approach, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1250.32s)]
*  who has obviously had to have spent time anticipating what we saw in the markets and [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1255.9199999999998s)]
*  some of the pushback. I'm assuming this all got gamed out because because it's a novel approach, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1261.52s)]
*  it need to be thought out. Whose throat do I get to choke if this proves to be wrong? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1267.36s)]
*  Well, Senator, you can certainly always talk to me, but I [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1272.1599999999999s)]
*  will. Are you at the tip of the spear? Well, I'm at the tip of the spear for certain. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1275.04s)]
*  Did you propose the all a prima approach? So first of all, I would push back, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1278.56s)]
*  Senator, just a little bit on this. We've for now we've excluded pharmaceuticals and [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1282.8799999999999s)]
*  semiconductors. Okay, well, let me get to that. Let's make it. We've excluded USMC. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1286.72s)]
*  Section 232 and 301. We know particularly Section 232 is still an aluminum. Section 301 is Chinese [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1290.8s)]
*  imports where there's no other provider. I overheard you say that maybe I thought I heard [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1298.56s)]
*  you say in response to another question that for the near term, there won't be any exclusions. Is [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1304.56s)]
*  that true of China where they have said the US is unilaterally bullying and completely groundless [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1308.8799999999999s)]
*  and they're going to fight to the end? Are the 232 and 301 tariffs exclusions on the shelves until [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1317.04s)]
*  we get to a reasonable agreement with China? I'm just trying to answer a question that I [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1324.8799999999999s)]
*  have several people in North Carolina asking. So the president, again, is the final decision maker [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1328.96s)]
*  on all of these things and he has directed that there not be exclusions. There will not be any [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1334.24s)]
*  exclusions on steel, aluminum or any products that are only manufactured in China for the foreseeable [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1337.92s)]
*  future until China determines what the end is because they said they're going to fight to the [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1345.1200000000001s)]
*  end. Again, I'm just trying to communicate questions that I've asked so there will be no [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1349.92s)]
*  exclusions. I won't waste your time asking for them. That's the main reason I wanted to ask the [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1354.0s)]
*  question. So again, I'm just trying to get my head around the logic of an all-upremor approach [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1358.16s)]
*  and I'm waiting to see it be successful. But it just seems like we've decided to begin a trade [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1364.4s)]
*  war on all fronts. And that's okay if the person who thought this through has an answer for why you [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1372.5600000000002s)]
*  go after partners that we have a very long story relationship with. I've been seeing memes like [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1380.3200000000002s)]
*  this all day, MAGA economics. You see that the economy without tariffs doing much better, the [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1388.08s)]
*  economy with tariffs much lower, but then all the MAGA people are like, see, tariffs work. So wait, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1393.76s)]
*  are tariffs either the greatest thing? But then you say that the fact that tariffs are withdrawn, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1400.6399999999999s)]
*  that's the greatest thing? I mean, didn't you all say that tariffs are going to make everybody [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1406.6399999999999s)]
*  super rich and be great? Y'all remove the tariffs. There's no consistency with this at all. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1410.3999999999999s)]
*  You take a look right here as Dave Whammon posts, Trump gets no concessions, art of the deal. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1416.48s)]
*  I destroyed the global markets and all I got was this lousy t-shirt. It should be noted too that [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1422.96s)]
*  while all of this is going on, aided and abetted by the Republicans in the Senate, but the [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1429.76s)]
*  MAGA Republicans in the House of Representatives, all but three House Republicans voted for the [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1433.92s)]
*  Trump tariffs. The procedural measure is arode frichtnerites, which preemptively surrenders [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1439.92s)]
*  congressional power to stop Trump tariffs passed with all Democrats voting no. Every Democrat voted [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1445.68s)]
*  no for this. You see the vote count here, these MAGA Republican senators supporting it. So here's [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1452.3200000000002s)]
*  how they procedurally engineered and rigged this thing so that there can never even be a vote on [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1457.76s)]
*  tariffs and Congress actually claiming its power. So here's Congress taking away its own power. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1464.8000000000002s)]
*  This is what the MAGA Republicans wrote into the budget. You ready? Each day during the period from [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1471.2s)]
*  April 9th, 2025 through September 30th, 2025 shall not constitute a calendar day for purposes of [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1476.64s)]
*  Section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution terminating a national [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1485.92s)]
*  emergency declared by the president on April 2nd, 2025. So what that language means is that [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1494.3999999999999s)]
*  there's going to be, they're not going to even allow a day to be counted for the issue to be [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1501.4399999999998s)]
*  brought up because they're saying the day doesn't even exist where they can even talk about tariffs. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1506.9599999999998s)]
*  If you want to talk about kissing the ring, think about what the MAGA Republicans did just there. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1514.24s)]
*  By the way, how embarrassing for Jameis and Greer what went down there. We'll keep you posted every [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gcU3XeBos&t=1519.44s)]
