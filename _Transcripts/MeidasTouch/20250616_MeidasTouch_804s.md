# Trump gets DESTROYED by Acosta for PARADE FALLOUT
**MeidasTouch:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko)
*  I'm joined by none other than Jim Acosta. Jim, I got to ask you to react to Donald Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=0.0s)]
*  disastrous dictator parade, but perhaps more importantly, the coverage, how I think [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=4.88s)]
*  independent media stepped up in covering the disastrous dictator parade accurately, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=10.24s)]
*  how I think corporate news failed to meet the moment. And then even with the no Kings coverage [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=16.16s)]
*  as well, how I think independent media really flexed its muscle covering the millions and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=21.44s)]
*  millions of people who showed up showed up while corporate news didn't. But first, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=27.44s)]
*  let me show you this video first. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  Jim, your reaction? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=42.96s)]
*  I mean, you know, it was it was as if somebody showed the the gif or the meme of Donald Trump [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=45.2s)]
*  as a toddler riding the toy tank down Pennsylvania Avenue. I mean, that's what it looked like. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, this was I mean, this was obviously an embarrassment for Donald Trump. He wanted a Kim [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=57.44s)]
*  Jung-un style dictator parade for his birthday. And it was it was more snooze-elini than moose-elini. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=62.64s)]
*  There were times where he could barely stay awake. And I think that video just showed a [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=72.64s)]
*  few moments ago, which I think was captured by scripts journalist Liz Landers. I mean, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=76.16s)]
*  the squeaking tank wheels. I mean, that was all you could hear in that one moment there. There were [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=81.28s)]
*  other crowd shots that showed that it was lightly attended. And of course, you know, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=86.56s)]
*  true to form, Steve Chung, the communications director of the White House, you know, in very [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=91.92s)]
*  Sean Spicer-esque fashion, puts out a tweet saying 250,000 people showed up for Trump's birthday [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=97.28s)]
*  party down on the mall. And it's just so sad. I mean, they just cannot help but continue to lie [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=103.76s)]
*  to sue this president's very fragile, you know, psyche and ego. But the fact of the matter is, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=110.4s)]
*  I mean, Ben, what you were saying just a few moments ago is just hitting the nail right on [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  the head. I mean, obviously, you know, this was a moment for independent media. Not only did [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=120.4s)]
*  independent media accurately cover the sprawling protests that were taking place across the country [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=127.2s)]
*  as far as part of the the No Kings movement over the weekend, I think they accurately described [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=133.68s)]
*  what an epic fail Donald Trump's dictator birthday parade, you know, how it went down. And so, I mean, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=140.56s)]
*  I think it's a very healthy moment for the country when that sort of thing happens. Because if you [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=148.0s)]
*  just watch the corporate press and what they were doing and how they were reporting it on Saturday, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=153.76s)]
*  I was looking at some of the coverage and the chyrons, you know, that are on screen. You can [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  just tell the one of these outlets are running scared right now. They're just afraid to take [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=164.88s)]
*  on this president. And that's where independent media fills the void. Look, you've got this was [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=169.04s)]
*  the headline that the Washington Post ran it. And look, there are some Washington Post writers [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=173.92s)]
*  who are still there who I respect. They do some great work. But I mean, when we all saw with our [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=179.68s)]
*  eyes what a disaster that dictator parade was, and this is what their post was on blue sky, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=186.88s)]
*  nonetheless, planes roared over DC on Saturday, tanks rolled along the National Mall, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=193.12s)]
*  brass bands resounded and thousands of soldiers march past cheering crowds as the army put on the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=200.48s)]
*  largest show of military might in the capital in more than three decades. And then on the left, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=209.04s)]
*  for those audio listeners, you've got this, I guess the one photo they could show, which is like [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  kind of a kind of a contracted photo to make it look like there's more people there. You have [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=222.0s)]
*  tanks in DC. And on the right, they have a guy who I guess they're using as their Trump supporter, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=226.64s)]
*  wearing a J six hat, as though like the day six memorabilia. And when I when I look at that, I go, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=232.72s)]
*  like y'all are doing that on purpose. And, and is it that you think that we're stupid? I mean, what, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=240.32s)]
*  what? Yeah. Yeah, it's strange. I mean, I was down in DC on Saturday, and I covered some of this stuff. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=246.88s)]
*  I mean, I saw some of the January six type folks who are down there and they were they were out [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  there in force. So I mean, so in some respects, it was a dictator birthday bash, because the people [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=259.6s)]
*  who would like to have a dictator in this country did show up to support Donald Trump. But at the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=264.88s)]
*  same time, yeah, I mean, when you see things like that, you know, it almost feels as though what [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=270.96s)]
*  they're trying to do is they're trying to cover the presidency as if Ronald Reagan were in the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=276.79999999999995s)]
*  Oval Office or George HW Bush were in the Oval Office. And we're back in that, you know, that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=281.76s)]
*  safe space of the 80s and the early 90s. You know, when the press could cover this stuff. But I mean, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  if Catherine Graham, the legendary publisher of the Washington Post were to see that tweet, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=292.0s)]
*  she would be rolling her grave right now. That's an embarrassment to the Washington Post. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=296.96s)]
*  I mean, obviously, you know, this is all, you know, I think being driven by the hand of Jeff [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=302.08s)]
*  Bezos, to some extent inside that news organization. And I was, you know, Ben, I don't know about you, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=307.28s)]
*  but I was surfing around trying to figure out if anybody had any independent crowd estimates [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=313.12s)]
*  of what went down on the National Mall. And it was very hard to find besides anecdotal reports. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  I saw a local news reporter in Washington, a guy named Mark Seagraves, who works for the local [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=324.96s)]
*  NBC station, very reputable journalist in the local market here. And he said that the crowd size was [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  nowhere near what they were predicting in terms of the 200 to 250,000 people range. And so, you know, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  in the old days, I mean, I covered the beginning of the first Trump administration when Donald Trump [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=344.32s)]
*  and Sean Spicer tried to say this was the largest inauguration crowd in the history of the world, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=349.67999999999995s)]
*  full stop. And then you could use we all went to, you know, the Google and found the crowd [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=353.68s)]
*  estimates. We found the, you know, the bird's eye view photographs of the National Mall, put them [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=360.48s)]
*  side by side with Barack Obama's. And that's the kind of stuff that just sends Donald Trump into [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=366.48s)]
*  orbit. I mean, but the other thing is just look at the footage of when he was watching the tanks [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=371.76s)]
*  and the soldiers go by, he could barely stay awake. I mean, he was obviously underwhelmed by what took [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=376.88s)]
*  place and I have to assume behind the scenes, he's not happy with the way it turned out. But he has [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=382.4s)]
*  only himself to blame as he typically does in almost every situation he gets himself into. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, at the core of this, though, also, to me is basic competence, because I don't think that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  we should have military parades, period full stop. But there's probably a competent way [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=400.08s)]
*  to organize it and pull it off at a high level with the pomp and circumstance and pageantry [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=405.76s)]
*  to put our military in a positive light and make everybody at least look good. I mean, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=412.96s)]
*  when I saw members of the army holding like a drone above their head, it was that I mean, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=420.24s)]
*  it reminded me of, you know, when you go to like a four or five year old kid's birthday party, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=428.08s)]
*  and it's like a Ninja Turtle party. But instead of the Ninja Turtles, they show up in the this is, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=434.24s)]
*  I guess, my own trauma growing up, I'm revealing they show up in like the cardboard box Ninja [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=438.88s)]
*  Turtles. And it's like, these aren't even what are you even giving me? Right? Like, it just looked so [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=443.6s)]
*  low brow and Santa's beard could barely hang on his face kind of situation, you know? Yeah. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=449.6s)]
*  And you go across the board, they can't fundamentally execute tasks. And there shouldn't [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  be a democrat and a republican thing. Just as people who like competent, responsible adult [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=461.76s)]
*  leadership, they can't execute tasks. Like, you know, and I totally I totally get what you're [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=467.92s)]
*  saying. And I should say, celebrating the 250th anniversary of the US Army, I'm down for that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=474.8s)]
*  That's totally fine. My grandfather, my mom's side was in the US Army. He served in World War [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=480.56s)]
*  Two. He's buried in Arlington National Cemetery. We all love and support our troops. There's just [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=485.12s)]
*  no question about that. But if the purpose of Donald Trump's purpose was to flex America's [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=489.12s)]
*  muscles, and just put on this show of force down on the National Mall, and the video that we have [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=494.4s)]
*  is the squeaking tank, you know, wheels going down the street, and the guy holding the drone over [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=500.4s)]
*  people's heads. I mean, come on, like that. What are you doing here? Get out of here with this stuff. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=507.2s)]
*  The United States military does not need Donald Trump to put on display, you know, what America's [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=513.28s)]
*  military might is all about. You know, the United States can do that on its own. And so to some [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=518.48s)]
*  extent, it was sort of, you know, it ran counter to that purpose. It was it was not, you know, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=523.9200000000001s)]
*  it did not show off America's strength. In many ways, it showed America's divide on Saturday, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=530.64s)]
*  because here you had, you know, this weak ass display of foe strength down on the National Mall. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=537.52s)]
*  There were Republican members of Congress who were nervous about showing up. There were members of [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=544.24s)]
*  the military and military veterans who were nervous about showing up because they didn't like [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=548.0s)]
*  the idea of what you were just saying, Ben, which is why are we having military parades in this [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=551.36s)]
*  democracy unless like we've won a war or something, you know? You know, if you want to have a ticker [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=555.12s)]
*  tape parade because we've won a war, that's a totally different situation. But and then on [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=559.28s)]
*  the other side of things, you have these massive, huge protests. I mean, from from New York City to [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=564.4s)]
*  Missoula, Montana, where people just took to the streets and showed out in force. And it was and [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=571.2s)]
*  it was really to me, if you want to know about what America's strength is all about, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=576.96s)]
*  I look to the no Kings rallies that took place over the weekend because what it showed was that [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=582.96s)]
*  America's democracy has not been defeated by this dictator wannabe. I mean, he can he can try to [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=587.68s)]
*  roll his tanks down Pennsylvania Avenue and flexes muscles and all of that stuff. And, you know, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=593.84s)]
*  Pete Hegseth can show up in a in a camouflage tie that he got at the Gap. But at the end of the day, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=600.88s)]
*  the real American strength, the real American might that was on display over the weekend, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=608.24s)]
*  I think was in those no Kings protests across the country, because what it shows to me is that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=612.88s)]
*  accountability is on its way. Accountability is coming. We may have to wait until 2026. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=619.2s)]
*  We may see some some glimmers of hope here and there in the gubernatorial races, congressional [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=624.4s)]
*  races that are coming up. But it showed to me that people are hopping mad. They're taken to the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=629.68s)]
*  streets. And they're not going to take this shit lying down. They're just not going to do it. And [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHhL8t1Lko&t=635.4399999999999s)]
