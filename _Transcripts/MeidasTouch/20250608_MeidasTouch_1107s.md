# Trump GOES NUTS on Sunday AM as MELTDOWN Accelerates
**MeidasTouch:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4)
*  Tanks and howitzers and other military equipment is rolling into Washington, D.C. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=0.0s)]
*  as Donald Trump prepares for his dictator parade on June 14th, the day of his birthday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  A Kim Jong-un style parade will be taking place. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=13.4s)]
*  You see here the images. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=17.44s)]
*  You're not looking at North Korea or Russia. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=19.36s)]
*  You're looking at the United States of America. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=22.36s)]
*  And this follows Donald Trump federalizing the National Guard for the first time. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=25.64s)]
*  This has happened since 1965 without a governor's approval. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=32.04s)]
*  The last time this happened, 1965, President Lyndon B. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=38.36s)]
*  Johnson sent forces to Alabama to guard civil rights demonstrators. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=42.56s)]
*  This time, Donald Trump sent the National Guard to go after people in the United [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=48.08s)]
*  States after Donald Trump escalated a situation by having ICE raids attacked [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=54.84s)]
*  hardworking Latino communities in California. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=61.32000000000001s)]
*  It should be noted as well that although Donald Trump says great job by the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=66.28s)]
*  National Guard stopping everything, and I'll read you what Trump said in a moment, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  the National Guard had not even arrived at that time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=76.2s)]
*  And so shout out to California Governor Gavin Newsom, who understands Donald Trump's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=80.39999999999999s)]
*  fraud and scams, and Newsom called him out right away. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=85.6s)]
*  So here's what Trump posted. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=89.0s)]
*  And then let me tell you what Newsom said in response. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=90.36s)]
*  So at 1141 p.m., really 2 a.m. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=93.56s)]
*  in the morning, Donald Trump wrote, great job by the National Guard in Los Angeles. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  After two days of violence, clashes and unrest, we have an incompetent Governor [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=102.28s)]
*  Newsom and Mayor Bass, who were as usual, just look at how they handle the fires. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=107.04s)]
*  And now they're very slow permitting disaster. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=114.44s)]
*  Federal permitting is complete, unable to handle the task. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=117.56s)]
*  He's not even speaking in sentences, Donald Trump. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=120.84s)]
*  These radical left protests by instigators and often paid troublemakers will not be [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=123.68s)]
*  tolerated. Also, from now on, masks will not be allowed to be worn at protests. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=129.28s)]
*  What do these people have to hide and why? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=136.12s)]
*  Again, thank you to the National Guard for a job well done. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=139.0s)]
*  Exclamation point. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  So Donald Trump, the dictator, saying that if you wear a mask to a protest, you will [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=144.84s)]
*  be violating the law and the National Guard or potentially the Marines, because Defense [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=152.12s)]
*  Secretary Pete Hegseth has said he's activated the Marines to go after American citizens [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=158.56s)]
*  on his order. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=164.67999999999998s)]
*  You will be attacked if you wear a mask. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=165.83999999999997s)]
*  Meanwhile, the ICE officers and the DHS officers and ATF are all wearing masks to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=169.04s)]
*  shield their identity. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  Also, Donald Trump, the insurrectionist himself, who attacked police officers, led an [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=178.44s)]
*  insurrection that led to police officers being killed on January 6th, did not activate [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=185.16s)]
*  the National Guard that day, but it was pretty easy for him to activate the National Guard [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  and now the Marines as well, potentially to attack American citizens. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=195.92s)]
*  Democratic Senator Chris Murphy puts it aptly. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=202.12s)]
*  It's important to remember that Trump isn't trying to heal or keep the peace. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  He's looking to inflame and divide. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=210.83999999999997s)]
*  His movement doesn't believe in democracy or protest. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=213.48s)]
*  And if they get a chance to end the rule of law, they will take it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=216.88s)]
*  None of this is on the level. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=221.04s)]
*  And as I've been saying, Donald Trump has been targeting not criminals, not gang [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=224.0s)]
*  bangers, not the bad guys. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=230.44s)]
*  He's been targeting the hardworking Latino community in California and elsewhere. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=233.0s)]
*  Also in Florida, we're seeing this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=239.6s)]
*  We're seeing it in Massachusetts, Texas, throughout the country. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=242.16s)]
*  Every single state. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=245.6s)]
*  And what the regime is doing is they're sending their ICE agents, ATF agents, and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=247.2s)]
*  they're also trying to work with local law enforcement who should not be working with [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=251.52s)]
*  them, hiding in the bushes at courtrooms and courthouses and waiting in the hallways [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=255.48s)]
*  and courtrooms. So as people are going through their lawful process, they're immediately [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=261.96s)]
*  detained, thrown in detention centers, ripped away from their family, raids on Home [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=266.72s)]
*  Depot, raids at factories and farms where people are, where Latinos are working and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=271.8s)]
*  contributing to our economy, most of whom are paying taxes who are integral to our [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=280.04s)]
*  economy, who are members of this community, peace loving, hardworking people. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  That is who the Trump regime is going after. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  And it's absolutely disgusting. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=293.2s)]
*  And I am glad that Gavin Newsom called Donald Trump out for it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=294.8s)]
*  And as this fascist propaganda parade continues, you have Donald Trump last night at a UFC [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=298.44s)]
*  fight. I mean, I just want you to look at the absurdity of this clown show that is the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=305.92s)]
*  United States of America. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=310.44s)]
*  Take a look at Trump right here putting on UFC belts. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=312.76s)]
*  You know, it is all cosplay fascism to a T. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  This is his safe space going into a UFC fight where we the people are fed up and sick and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=321.0s)]
*  tired of this tyrannical authoritarian crap. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=326.72s)]
*  Let's be very, very clear with our language. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=330.32000000000005s)]
*  We're not in a constitutional crisis. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  We are past that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=335.88000000000005s)]
*  The United States of America, June 8th, 2025, is an authoritarian regime led by an [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=337.20000000000005s)]
*  idiocracy, the Trump regime. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=343.96000000000004s)]
*  The United States of America is no longer the hegemonic leading power in the world. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  No way Trump has weakened the United States to a frail, weak, pathetic thing like like [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=351.32s)]
*  Bedminster or like Mar-a-Lago, which may look a little bit pretty from the outside. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=358.36s)]
*  But when you look inside, it has mold and it's gross and it can't even pass a freaking [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  health inspection like Bedminster couldn't, which got what a 32 out of 100 in the local [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=369.52s)]
*  health inspection. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=375.68s)]
*  Literally the worst score you can possibly get. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=376.72s)]
*  And yes, I do use the language authoritarian regime because this is authoritarian things [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  that happen. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=385.0s)]
*  The Trump regime reached out to ABC and Disney after one of ABC's reporters, Terry [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  Moran, criticized Donald Trump and Stephen Miller for what they did. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=392.24s)]
*  And Moran got suspended by ABC and its parent company, Disney. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  ABC News says senior national correspondent Terry Moran has been suspended pending further [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=402.04s)]
*  evaluation. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=407.08000000000004s)]
*  This since deleted tweet is the reason for the suspension. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=408.2s)]
*  So if you're a reporter and you say truthful things that you're critical of the regime, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=411.52s)]
*  you get fired right now by the American oligarchy. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=416.52s)]
*  That's what happens. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=420.0s)]
*  And we're a fascist state. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=420.76s)]
*  We're a fascist country in America. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=422.59999999999997s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=424.2s)]
*  We're fighting here at the Midas Touch Network from within. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=425.28s)]
*  That's what's going on. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  Moran wrote, The thing about Stephen Miller is not that he is the brains behind Trumpism. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=430.44s)]
*  Yes, he is one of the people who conceptualizes the impulses of the Trumpist movement and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  translates them into policy. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=440.91999999999996s)]
*  But that's not what's interesting about Miller. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=442.84s)]
*  It's not brains. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=444.76s)]
*  It's bile. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=445.84s)]
*  Miller is a man who is richly endowed with the capacity for hatred. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=447.47999999999996s)]
*  He is a world class hater. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=451.44s)]
*  You can see this just by looking at him because you can see that his hatred are his [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=453.24s)]
*  spiritual nourishment. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=457.24s)]
*  He eats his hate. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=458.47999999999996s)]
*  Trump is a world class hater, but his hatred only is only a means to an end. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=459.88s)]
*  And that end is his own glorification. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=465.32s)]
*  This is his spiritual nourishment. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=467.84s)]
*  Posting that now gets you basically suspended or fired from your job in the United States [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=470.84s)]
*  of America. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=476.28s)]
*  That is absolutely pathetic. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  And that is why we need more independent media. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=478.64s)]
*  You know, one of the things that I also like to see as well is what the right wing is like, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=481.28s)]
*  what their media diet is like, like what they are looking at. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=485.88s)]
*  You know, it was notable, for example, that, you know, I made this post, which I thought [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=489.79999999999995s)]
*  was a pretty, you know, basic post where I just said, you know, hey, the United States [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=494.0s)]
*  of, you know, the United States of America should not be attacking these hardworking [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=499.24s)]
*  Latino communities. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=504.8s)]
*  And all these right wing influencers started posting at me and saying, you know, how dare [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=505.72s)]
*  they? They're all unlawful. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=512.0s)]
*  These are horrible people. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=513.24s)]
*  Get rid of them. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=514.48s)]
*  And I'm like, didn't you all say that you were just going to go after the criminals? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=515.64s)]
*  Now you're revealing your true color. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=518.84s)]
*  It's important to know what they're saying on the right wing media. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=520.64s)]
*  Like, take a look at this article. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=523.72s)]
*  Army says Trump's military parade could cause 16 million dollars in damage to Washington [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=525.32s)]
*  streets. By the way, I think it's going to be 10x that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=531.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't think this military dictator parade is going to be 45 million dollars. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=535.1600000000001s)]
*  Look, you have 7000 soldiers, 130 vehicles, 50 helicopters, and you're telling me that's [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=539.48s)]
*  only going to cost 50 million dollars or 45 million dollars. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=546.4s)]
*  No way they are understating that. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=549.96s)]
*  I think it's going to be like 500 million dollars with the cost of 7000 moving 7000 [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=552.1999999999999s)]
*  soldiers, 50 helicopters and 130 vehicles. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=557.24s)]
*  I don't buy the 45 million dollar number. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=560.68s)]
*  I don't buy the number that it's going to cause only 16 million in damage. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=562.9599999999999s)]
*  I think it's going to cause hundreds of millions of damage. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=567.12s)]
*  But there's zero right wing coverage at all on the cost. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=569.4s)]
*  And the left wing coverage, the quote unquote left wing, are these low ball numbers as [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=573.8s)]
*  well. The research tool that I use to find all this stuff out. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=578.4399999999999s)]
*  Just so you know, it was called ground news. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=581.4s)]
*  I think it's essential nowadays to see through any double standards in the current [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=583.4s)]
*  media ecosphere. If you go to ground dot news slash MTN or scan the QR code right [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=587.1999999999999s)]
*  there, we're giving our viewers 40 percent off ground news is top tier vantage plan, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=592.76s)]
*  which will get you unlimited access to everything I've been talking about. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=597.4s)]
*  Ground news is subscriber funded so they don't rely on ads that could also introduce [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=601.24s)]
*  bias. Subscribing supports our channel and their independent team working to keep the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=604.56s)]
*  media transparent. One more time, go to ground dot news slash MTN. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=608.1600000000001s)]
*  And we're giving our viewers that 50 40 percent off that ground near that ground [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=612.6s)]
*  news top tier vantage plan 40 percent off. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=616.32s)]
*  All right. Back to my reporting as well. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  I want to share this with you. This is what Caroline Levitt said about the suspension [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=621.44s)]
*  of Terry Moran, how the Trump regime reached out right away to [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=626.44s)]
*  to ABC and Disney and said, you need to do something about this guy. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=633.2800000000001s)]
*  And ABC said it would play this clip last night in a since deleted post. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=637.0799999999999s)]
*  So called journalist Terry Moran went on a rampage against Stephen Miller. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=641.1999999999999s)]
*  What happened, Caroline? Well, ABC is going to have to answer for what their [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=645.36s)]
*  again so-called journalist put out on Twitter in the wee hours of the night, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=652.28s)]
*  calling Stephen Miller vile. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=657.64s)]
*  They said that President Trump is a world class hater. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=659.36s)]
*  And this is again coming from someone who is supposed to be an unbiased and [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=662.88s)]
*  professional journalist. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=666.56s)]
*  This is unacceptable and unhinged rhetoric coming from someone who works at a major [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=668.2399999999999s)]
*  television network. We have reached out to ABC. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=673.1199999999999s)]
*  They have said they will be taking action. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=676.1199999999999s)]
*  So we will see what they do. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=678.4799999999999s)]
*  But I think this I want to show you what Maga Mike Johnson said moments ago where [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=680.3199999999999s)]
*  Maga Mike Johnson was asked, are you OK with Marines being on the streets of L.A. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=684.8s)]
*  and cities going after citizens? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=690.76s)]
*  Because Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, put out a statement saying the [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=693.12s)]
*  following. The Department of Defense is mobilizing the National Guard immediately. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=697.76s)]
*  If violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=702.0400000000001s)]
*  They are on high alert. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=708.0400000000001s)]
*  Here's what Maga Mike Johnson said. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=709.5600000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. Secretary Hegseth said that active duty Marines there at Camp [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=711.0400000000001s)]
*  Pendleton, there by San Diego, are on high alert and could be mobilized. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=716.36s)]
*  Could we really see active duty Marines on the streets of Los Angeles? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=721.4s)]
*  You know, one of our core principles is maintaining peace through strength. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=724.8s)]
*  We do that on foreign affairs and domestic affairs as well. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=728.36s)]
*  I don't think that's heavy handed. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=731.36s)]
*  I think that's an important thing. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=732.76s)]
*  Marines into the streets of an American city is heavy handed. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=734.2s)]
*  We have to be prepared to do what is necessary. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=737.28s)]
*  And I think the the notice that that might happen might have the deterring effect. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=739.28s)]
*  OK, now our editor in chief, Ron Filipkowski, responds. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=743.96s)]
*  One of our core principles that he's a veteran, he goes, one of our core [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=747.72s)]
*  principles is to not deploy the Marines domestically to carry out law enforcement [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=750.68s)]
*  functions. They are in train for that and aren't there for that since the founding [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=755.4799999999999s)]
*  of the Republic. But this toady will never go against Trump on anything. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=759.8s)]
*  Just moving briefly over to the issue of the attacks on the business community [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=764.92s)]
*  and uncertainty in trade. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=769.5999999999999s)]
*  Here you have on Face the Nation, you have Kevin Hassett, Donald Trump's chief [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=771.68s)]
*  and national economic counsel advisor. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=778.48s)]
*  And you have the host basically saying, so, you know, what's what's going on with [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=781.0s)]
*  these tariffs? I mean, are we trying to negotiate down the tariffs? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=787.32s)]
*  And has that's like now the tariffs are always going to be here. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=791.44s)]
*  Play this clip. You are saying tariffs are staying put, that this is a constant [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=794.04s)]
*  source of reciprocal deals. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=799.6s)]
*  Right. But yes, I hear you. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=801.88s)]
*  Where they are, we're working it out and we're opening up markets. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=803.76s)]
*  But this is this is where I'm stuck, because deals is about negotiating down the [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=806.5600000000001s)]
*  tariffs. So that's a diminishing source of revenue over time. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=812.48s)]
*  But are you saying that there will be blanket tariffs of last year? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=816.6400000000001s)]
*  What was that year before we got here? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=821.88s)]
*  We were raising 80 billion a year in tariffs. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=823.6s)]
*  Right now, the CBO projects that we're going to get two point eight trillion over [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=826.5200000000001s)]
*  the next 10 years. Exactly where the number ends up is going to depend on how much [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=829.8000000000001s)]
*  foreign countries open up their markets to our products and how much how well they [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=833.5999999999999s)]
*  treat our farmers. And you don't know how much revenue revenue was 80 billion last [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=837.68s)]
*  year. Revenue, tariff revenues not going away. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=842.16s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. But we but we don't know what the tariffs are going to be. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=844.52s)]
*  We're negotiating them on a country by country basis. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=849.16s)]
*  We've got a whole bunch of trade deals. We've got a trade deal with the UK. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=851.2399999999999s)]
*  That's all right. You can see what the trade deal with the UK is now. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=853.64s)]
*  Right. So it's a fluctuating number. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=856.04s)]
*  It's not it's not a constant. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=857.56s)]
*  And also this Trump regime lackey is asked, so can you give the business community [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=859.68s)]
*  some certainty? And he goes, well, the one thing you can be certain about is there's [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=864.7199999999999s)]
*  going to be tariffs here. Play this clip. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=868.48s)]
*  The Federal Reserve, who said the rules are really unclear and business leaders need [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=870.24s)]
*  certainty. When will they get that certainty from the administration? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=875.64s)]
*  Well, you can be certain that there's going to be some tariffs. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=880.0s)]
*  And the stuff that folks have been saying that's going to happen to tariffs is [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  inconsistent with what you and I have talked about before, Margaret. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=886.04s)]
*  So what's going on, right, is that we've had a trade deficit with China forever and [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=888.76s)]
*  ever because they just want to sell stuff here so they create jobs in China and help [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=893.08s)]
*  control their government. So people are unemployed. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=898.04s)]
*  Then it's harder for a dictatorship to run. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=900.12s)]
*  And so the point is just that if we put a tariff on them, then they're going to [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=902.52s)]
*  bear the tariff. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=906.48s)]
*  Maga Mike Johnson is asked about why does this budget bill have, you know, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=907.28s)]
*  benefits for like tanning beds? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=913.36s)]
*  Why are you screwing over the American people? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=915.04s)]
*  But you all are very upset about what's happening with tanning beds. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=917.48s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, we are. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=920.88s)]
*  He tries to blame it on Biden. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=922.52s)]
*  And then the host is like, it was not Biden. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=924.36s)]
*  It goes back to 2010. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=926.32s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, but Biden enhanced it. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=927.5600000000001s)]
*  Maga Mike's just a liar about everything. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=929.6s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=931.48s)]
*  What about tanning beds? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=932.24s)]
*  It eliminates a 10 percent tax on tanning beds. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=935.0s)]
*  I mean, how did how did that become a priority? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=937.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, look, I think that was an unfair thing that the Biden administration put on an [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=939.48s)]
*  industry because they decided it was actually it goes back to 2010. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=944.08s)]
*  It's been around for 50 years, but the Biden administration enhanced it. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=947.0s)]
*  And there be modifications probably to that in the final package as well. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=950.16s)]
*  But we'll see how it comes out. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=953.76s)]
*  OK, then he's asked about the provision on gun silencers here. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=955.72s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRAGtWdsS4&t=958.84s)]
