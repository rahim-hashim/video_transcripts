# GOP Cross Exam of Witnesses UTTERLY BACKFIRES at Hearing
**MeidasTouch:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI)
*  the MAGA Republican cross-examination during these congressional hearings? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=0.0s)]
*  No bueno. Very, very bad. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=5.2s)]
*  If you want to know how you don't do cross-examinations, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=8.1s)]
*  I want to show you what went down with these MAGA Republican Congress members and senators [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=12.6s)]
*  who tried to cross-examine these witnesses, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=18.0s)]
*  and the witnesses got the upper hand on them [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=21.0s)]
*  and humiliated the MAGA Republican Congress members and senators. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=24.7s)]
*  And I want you to watch this one, it's great. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=29.3s)]
*  You have the MAGA Republican Congress member Ralph Norman [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  trying to cross-examine Democratic Congresswoman Velazquez [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=36.0s)]
*  and just watch how she turns the tables on him and makes him look like a fool. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=40.9s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=47.3s)]
*  It's obviously extending the burden on our middle class, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=48.2s)]
*  on our working families, and on our small businesses. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=51.6s)]
*  A lot of the illegals that we've encountered, they've got a document. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=54.5s)]
*  The Biden administration issued driver's license, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=58.5s)]
*  issued fake social security numbers. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=61.1s)]
*  So if they'll lie with that, what else will they lie on? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=63.699999999999996s)]
*  Ms. Fidelenko, do you want to answer any of that? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=70.0s)]
*  Where is the evidence, sir? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=74.1s)]
*  Where is the evidence? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=75.7s)]
*  Show me the proof. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=77.8s)]
*  You just can't come here and make up things up without presenting evidence. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=79.6s)]
*  And the administrator, for six months that has been in office, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=85.69999999999999s)]
*  has not come before the committee to answer questions [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=89.8s)]
*  and to share with us what is her opinion on the different proposals. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=93.5s)]
*  It doesn't work that way. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=99.8s)]
*  It does not work that way. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  I can see that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=102.6s)]
*  It does not work that way. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=103.8s)]
*  And when you talk about the billions of dollars [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=104.69999999999999s)]
*  that have gone to ineligible small businesses, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=107.89999999999999s)]
*  yes, you're right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  It happened under the first Trump administration [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=113.4s)]
*  when we implemented the PPP and he loosened up the guardrails on the PPP. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=117.0s)]
*  They're not being enforced under the Biden administration. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=125.10000000000001s)]
*  Just like the border. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  You're totally wrong. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=129.4s)]
*  All right. Now in this next clip, you have lawyer v. lawyer. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=132.6s)]
*  Although Josh Hawley, the Mago Republican senator from Missouri, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=137.4s)]
*  sure don't act like a lawyer a lot of times. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=141.7s)]
*  That's putting it lightly. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=144.7s)]
*  So here you have Senator Josh Hawley, Mago Republican, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  is speaking to Professor Kate Shaw. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=151.5s)]
*  Also, she's a great podcast host as well. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  And he's saying, look at all of these leftist radical judges [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=158.7s)]
*  who are issuing all of these injunctions. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=163.2s)]
*  Look at my chart. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=165.5s)]
*  And then Professor Kate Shaw is like, you know, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=167.0s)]
*  the other explanation is that Donald Trump's engaged in so many crimes [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=169.9s)]
*  that it ain't just Democratic judge issuing injunctions against Donald Trump. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=174.8s)]
*  It's Republican judges who are issuing injunctions. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=179.5s)]
*  Trump judges, George W. Bush judges, Reagan judges [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=182.5s)]
*  are the ones issuing the injunctions. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=186.9s)]
*  In addition to Democratic appointed judges. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=188.6s)]
*  Here, watch this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=190.8s)]
*  Really only once Trump came into office for the first time. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=191.9s)]
*  You don't think this is a little bit anomalous? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=195.3s)]
*  You don't think that's a little bit strange? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=197.5s)]
*  Very plausible explanation, Senator, you have to consider [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=198.7s)]
*  is that he is engaged in much more lawless activity than other presidents, right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  You must think this was never used before the 1960s. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=205.5s)]
*  And suddenly, Democrat judges decide we love the nationwide injunction. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=209.1s)]
*  And then when Biden comes to office, no, no, actually. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=214.1s)]
*  It's Republican appointees as well, Senator. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=215.89999999999998s)]
*  And the 1960s is where some scholars begin, sort of locate the beginning of this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  Can you identify one before then? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=222.6s)]
*  Mila Sohoney, who's another scholar of universal injunction, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=223.6s)]
*  suggests 1913 is actually the first of others in the 20s. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=226.4s)]
*  Senator Oh, the Republican endured for 150 years before the nationwide injunction. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  Mila Well, the federal government was doing a lot less until 100 years ago. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=233.1s)]
*  So, you know, there's many things that have changed in the last 100 or the last 50 years. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=236.4s)]
*  Senator So long as it is a Democrat president office, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  then we should have no nationwide injunctions. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=244.6s)]
*  If it's a Republican president, then this is absolutely fine warranted and called for. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=247.0s)]
*  How can our system of law survive on those principles, Professor? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  Mila I think a system in which there are no constraints on the president is a very dangerous system. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=256.0s)]
*  Senator That's not what you thought when Joe Biden, that is not what you thought when Joe Biden was president. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=261.4s)]
*  You said that is not what you said. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=265.9s)]
*  You said it was a travesty for the principles of democracy, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=267.5s)]
*  notions of judicial impartiality and the rule of law. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=272.0s)]
*  You also said when Joe Biden was president. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=274.7s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=276.7s)]
*  You also said when Joe Biden was president, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=277.8s)]
*  you said the idea that anyone would foreign shop to get a judge who would issue a nationwide injunction was just politicians, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=280.5s)]
*  just judges looking like politicians in robes. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=287.7s)]
*  Again, it threatened the underlying legal system. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=290.5s)]
*  People just trying to get the result they wanted. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=293.29999999999995s)]
*  It was a travesty for the rule of law. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=295.2s)]
*  But you're fine with all of that if it's getting the result that you want. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=297.4s)]
*  Senator Sir, the Supreme Court agreed unanimously with me in that case, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=300.09999999999997s)]
*  There was no standing. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=302.7s)]
*  The case should never have been allowed to proceed. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=303.4s)]
*  The combination of parties without standing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=306.2s)]
*  And the legal judge division. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=308.59999999999997s)]
*  No, no, they did not. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=311.2s)]
*  They did not issue a ruling on the nationwide injunction. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=312.3s)]
*  You criticized the injunction nationwide. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=315.2s)]
*  Listen in a case where no one had standing. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=317.8s)]
*  And then you just have the MAGA Republican Senators just straight up running away from the cameras. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=319.5s)]
*  Like here you have MAGA Republican Senator Joni Ernst, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=326.5s)]
*  the senator from Iowa who said, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=330.4s)]
*  we're all gonna die. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=332.9s)]
*  So who cares if the GOP's disastrous budget bill kills ya? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=334.28s)]
*  You're gonna die anyway. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=339.84s)]
*  Then she made that followup video at a cemetery, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  but now she's not answering the questions. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=343.94s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=346.76s)]
*  Hello, I'm Beth. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  Can you clarify your comments [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=349.94s)]
*  on the count all last week, Senator? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=351.84s)]
*  Hi, I'm very compassionate, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=354.79999999999995s)]
*  and you need to listen to the entire conversation. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=357.4s)]
*  Do you have any regret about that? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=360.56s)]
*  Can you explain or protect the most vulnerable? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=361.4s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=367.44s)]
*  Now going back to Professor Kate Shaw right here, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=368.76s)]
*  I want you to take a listen as she and Democratic Senator, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=373.28s)]
*  Adam Schiff, exposed the lawlessness [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=378.44s)]
*  in this Trump regime. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=381.44s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  But this comes in the context of the administration [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  also going after law firms. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=385.72s)]
*  It seems very much a part of a concerted effort [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=388.44000000000005s)]
*  to attack the rule of law [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  and using the law to defend people's rights. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=393.12s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about the broader context. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  I do think that attacks on judges [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=398.36s)]
*  and attacks on law firms are of a piece. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  They seem designed to seek to neutralize sources [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=402.72s)]

*  to this administration. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=410.18s)]
*  And if law firms can't take on unpopular causes [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  because they are scared to run afoul of the president, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=414.68s)]
*  and if judges are scared to rule against the president, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=417.6s)]
*  then we really have lost any meaningful check [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=420.32s)]
*  on a president. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=422.92s)]
*  And as I said in my opening remarks, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=423.8s)]
*  I think if the constitution is committed [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=425.7s)]
*  to a single principle, it is limits on power, right? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=427.26s)]
*  No absolute power. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=430.44s)]
*  And I worry that we are on a path toward few, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=431.6s)]
*  if any, meaningful limits on the president. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=434.44s)]
*  And here Professor Shaw also talks about the threats [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=436.68s)]
*  from the Trumpers that they take [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=440.52s)]
*  and how they're going about attacking judges [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=445.64s)]
*  with this pizza threat that they do, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=449.88s)]
*  where they order pizza to the judge's home [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=452.52s)]
*  to show that they know where the judges live. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=455.24s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=457.76s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about this phenomenon now [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  of people sending pizzas to judges [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=460.96s)]
*  and the implicit threat in that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=463.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think it's, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=466.24s)]
*  this is also something that I don't think [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=467.84s)]
*  we've seen before, right? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=469.52s)]
*  There is a clearly some kind of coordinated effort [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=470.59999999999997s)]
*  to seek to intimidate federal judges and their families [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=473.76000000000005s)]
*  by sending pizzas, communicating the message [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=476.20000000000005s)]
*  that their residence, their addresses are known. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=478.36s)]
*  And some of the pizzas bear the name [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=481.04s)]
*  of the murdered son of district judge, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  Esther Solis from New Jersey. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=485.48s)]
*  And the message there, I think, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=487.44000000000005s)]
*  is a very clear one of very serious threat. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=488.68s)]
*  And I think judges are taking that threat [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=491.8s)]
*  and the marshals are as well [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=493.40000000000003s)]
*  from the reporting that we've seen very seriously. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=494.92s)]
*  You know, I've been the recipient of that threat [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=497.8s)]
*  a ton of times where people send pizzas to my home. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=500.52000000000004s)]
*  They don't even pay for the pizza. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=504.64s)]
*  I still eat the pizza. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=505.48s)]
*  They paid for it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=506.32s)]
*  But it's like, it's a serious matter [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=507.56s)]
*  and they do it to threaten and intimidate you. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=509.48s)]
*  And it's happened, unfortunately, a lot of times to me. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=511.36s)]
*  I can't even begin to imagine all of the money [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=514.6s)]
*  that I've spent on skincare and beauty products [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=516.88s)]
*  over the years to battle issues like acne [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=518.96s)]
*  and damaged hair and eczema, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=521.16s)]
*  change in hair color, rashes, et cetera. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=523.12s)]
*  But I recently realized that I was completely overlooking [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=525.96s)]
*  the most fundamental step, the water I shower in. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=529.0s)]

*  on those schools. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=729.88s)]

*  How can it help them? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=761.12s)]
*  And that's not in place yet, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=761.96s)]
*  but I think that's going to be very, very helpful. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=763.36s)]
*  Here's the other thing. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=765.64s)]
*  Where are our guidance counselors in high schools? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=766.72s)]
*  Who are they talking to? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=770.32s)]
*  I think that they need to be thoroughly informed [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=771.68s)]
*  and I think they need to look at the cost of education. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=775.8s)]
*  You're cutting the number of counselors [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=777.8s)]
*  in these schools at the same time. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=779.52s)]
*  Well, the counselors that are doing their jobs [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=781.4s)]
*  can provide information to these students. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=784.2s)]
*  There aren't enough of them. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=786.16s)]
*  That's the point I'm making. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=787.4s)]
*  And the situation is terrible for these students. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=788.6s)]
*  First generation students who are being exploited [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=791.44s)]
*  by these schools, they need your protection. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=793.76s)]
*  They need our protection. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=796.16s)]
*  They deserve it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=797.28s)]
*  They're doing the right thing. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=798.28s)]
*  And unfortunately, you're reducing the number of people [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=799.6800000000001s)]
*  to enforce the law. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=802.08s)]
*  Just in general, yesterday in particular, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=803.32s)]
*  these MAGA Republican Congress members and senators [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=806.2s)]
*  were in total disarray. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=808.88s)]
*  You had MAGA Mike Johnson feeling, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=810.96s)]
*  I'll do a whole other video on this, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=813.0s)]
*  betrayed by Elon Musk. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=815.0s)]
*  Musk says the budget bill's a disaster. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=817.2s)]
*  And then MAGA Mike Johnson's like, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=820.32s)]
*  but you're my friend. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=822.0400000000001s)]
*  He's my friend. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=823.6400000000001s)]
*  My friends aren't supposed to do this to each other. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=824.9200000000001s)]
*  You're watching this clip. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=827.08s)]
*  Let me say this. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=828.48s)]
*  It's very disappointing, okay? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=829.8000000000001s)]
*  I've come to consider Elon a good friend. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=831.48s)]
*  He's obviously a very intelligent person [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=834.0s)]
*  and he's done a lot of great work. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=836.32s)]
*  With all due respect, my friend Elon is terribly wrong [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=837.76s)]
*  about the one big beautiful bill. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=841.5200000000001s)]
*  And then you have Russell Vogt, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=842.9200000000001s)]
*  the author of Project 2025, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=845.32s)]
*  who's now the director of the Office of Management [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=848.1600000000001s)]
*  and Budget. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=850.5600000000001s)]
*  And he's asked a pretty simple freaking question of, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=851.4000000000001s)]
*  can you explain why you aren't codifying [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=854.36s)]
*  or turning all these doge cuts into law? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=857.72s)]
*  And he's like, because we wanna make sure they pass [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=860.72s)]
*  and we don't think that they will pass [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=864.48s)]
*  if we send them all to Congress. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=866.44s)]
*  Well, if you don't think they can pass Congress, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=868.12s)]
*  hey Russell, are you admitting that they're [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=871.24s)]
*  illegal? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=874.8399999999999s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=876.0s)]
*  Can you explain why, to people who may say, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=877.1999999999999s)]
*  and not understand why you're not sending [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=879.8s)]
*  all of the doge cuts up to Capitol Hill? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=881.24s)]
*  Yeah, I've been pretty clear about it. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=883.7199999999999s)]
*  I wanna make sure that they pass. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=885.4799999999999s)]
*  Why do you send all of them and get all of them to pass? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=887.52s)]
*  Because I wanna make sure that they, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=889.4s)]
*  you take the first tranche and see if it passes. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=891.8399999999999s)]
*  The wider you do in terms of a package, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=894.92s)]
*  the harder it is to pass. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=897.7199999999999s)]
*  And if it doesn't pass, this is the real world, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=900.16s)]
*  and we will lose flexibility that we have [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=903.16s)]
*  to use executive tools to find other ways [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=906.0s)]
*  to make the doge cuts permanent. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=908.64s)]
*  How many were sent directly? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=910.04s)]
*  Do you expect? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=910.88s)]
*  Explain that directly to Elon Musk. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=911.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, have you made this case to Elon directly? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=912.92s)]
*  I'm explaining it to everyone. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=914.88s)]
*  How many were sent packages do you expect? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=917.24s)]
*  We will send up more if the president is on board with that [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=919.4399999999999s)]
*  as we see evidence of Congress passing them. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=923.3199999999999s)]
*  This is a first step in it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=926.3199999999999s)]
*  I think it'll be on the floor next week, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=929.0799999999999s)]
*  according to what the speaker told me yesterday. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=930.6s)]
*  And then from there, we'll see where we are in the Senate. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=933.8000000000001s)]
*  But again, we wanna see it pass. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=935.96s)]
*  I think it will pass, and then we'll go from there. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=938.44s)]
*  Well, there you have it, folks. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=941.0400000000001s)]
*  I love to highlight good cross-exam [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=943.08s)]
*  when I see the art of cross-exam, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=946.6s)]
*  but what the MAGA Republicans was doing was atrocious. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=949.0400000000001s)]
*  And shout out to Democratic Congresswoman Velazquez, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=952.12s)]
*  who just pointed the truth out, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=955.9200000000001s)]
*  ready for it, ready to fight back. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=958.8s)]
*  And she totally schooled MAGA Republican Congressmember [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jtp9emYTI&t=961.04s)]
