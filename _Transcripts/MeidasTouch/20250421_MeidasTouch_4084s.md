Video Description: In this episode of the MeidasTouch Podcast, we break down the mounting chaos surrounding the Trump regime. Reports indicate a full-blown meltdown at the Pentagon, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on the verge of being ousted amid new scandalous leaks. Meanwhile, Trump tanks global markets with reckless economic policies and launches another attack on the Federal Reserve Chair—just as his promised tariff “deals” continue to unravel with U.S. allies. We also cover the death of Pope Francis, as well as yet another weekend of massive global protests against Trump’s authoritarian rule. Ben, Brett and Jordy discuss all that and more!

# LIVE: MeidasTouch RESPONDS to MAJOR Breaking News - 4/21/25
**MeidasTouch:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ)
*  Donald Trump continues to tank the economy, defy Supreme Court orders, make deranged all cap posts all day, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=0.0s)]
*  lose in a reckless trade war against the world that he initiated, cover up his Secretary of Defense text messaging war plans to his wife, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=8.0s)]
*  break the U.S. bond market, cause tourists to avoid the United States like the plague, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=16.0s)]
*  promote a health department that's actually pro-plague, betray our alliances, crash the dollar, empower China, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=21.0s)]
*  and capitulate to Russia and brag about Trump-Gaza. Do you feel great? Say thank you all the while. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=29.0s)]
*  Donald Trump just goes in golfs wearing these bizarre Gulf of America hats on the taxpayer dollar. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=37.0s)]
*  We've got a lot to discuss on the Midas Touch podcast. I'm Ben Misalas, joined by Brett and Jordy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=44.0s)]
*  I want to wish everybody a happy Easter at the outset. Of course, I also want to recognize some tragic news today [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=50.0s)]
*  that Pope Francis passed away at the age of 88. So our hearts and thoughts and prayers go out to, of course, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=58.0s)]
*  the Vatican himself, everybody who's practicing, and everybody in general. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=67.0s)]
*  He did a lot to advance the cause of human rights and to stand up for people who have less means. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=71.0s)]
*  And so it was sad news to wake up to. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=79.0s)]
*  Happy Easter to everybody. It's good to be here. Everybody listening here on Apple Podcasts and Spotify, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=82.0s)]
*  everybody watching us live, always good to be here with the Midas Touch Network to deliver you the latest and greatest news. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=87.0s)]
*  Well, not too great, I guess, because Donald Trump continues to crash the economy and just send the world into total chaos. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=93.0s)]
*  And he refuses, as always, to take any responsibility for his actions, just continues to try to deflect blame to other people. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=100.0s)]
*  But guess what, brothers? Guess what, Midas Mighty? The people are rising up and it was incredible to see these protests over the weekend. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=107.0s)]
*  Once again, these 50-51 protests. I want to first start off this episode by giving a huge shout out to all the organizers of these events [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=114.0s)]
*  who did such a fantastic job of bringing folks together. I saw people not only in the big cities, but all the towns across America. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=122.0s)]
*  I saw people not only in the towns across America, but in these cities and towns across the entire world. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=130.0s)]
*  It was truly an incredible show of solidarity and shout out to everybody who was out there, including, by the way, the Midas Mighty. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=136.0s)]
*  I'd be remiss if I did not shout you guys out. We saw all the Midas Touch signs out there, which was so great to see. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=143.0s)]
*  We'll get into some of this more a little later, but so awesome to hear about all the reports of all the Midas Touch listeners out there on the ground. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=149.0s)]
*  Jordy, what's the latest? That is just the coolest. For the audio listeners, Brett was showing some some protest signs. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=157.0s)]
*  Shout out to all the folks, man. Everyone out there on the ground. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=165.0s)]
*  And then a special shout out to the Midas Mighty for bringing the love and passion that we talk about here to the streets. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=169.0s)]
*  Thank you guys so much. It means the world and it's incredible. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=176.0s)]
*  One quick housekeeping note before we get started. We're going to do something new on the Midas Touch YouTube channel, the Midas Touch Network this week. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=180.0s)]
*  We're going to do a members only video. So, hey, we're always trying to figure out how to give back to this community, especially the folks who are investing into the into the network and helping out so much. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=186.0s)]
*  We know times aren't easy and so we're super appreciative. I know we do the emojis in the chat. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=198.0s)]
*  One of the things, though, that we're trying to up our game now to give back to the members is we're going to do a members only video, TBD on the content. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=203.0s)]
*  It's going to come at the end of the week, become a member right now here on the Midas Touch Network, or you could gift memberships to folks so they could check out this exclusive video that will post here on YouTube later this week. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=210.0s)]
*  And so super excited for that. Benji, where do you want to start off today? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=221.0s)]
*  I think before we talk about Trump tanking the economy, some context is helpful as this account at TripleNet Investor says, people don't realize how good we had it in January 2025. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=225.0s)]
*  The stock market was near all time highs. The housing was near all time highs. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=238.0s)]
*  Inflation was at about 3% and going down to hit that Fed target of about 2%. Unemployment was at 4%. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=243.0s)]
*  There was about a 5% return on cash risk free. Real GDP was growing at about 3% a year. We were leading the world in GDP growth. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=253.0s)]
*  16.2 million jobs created. Again, record low unemployment, 40,000 infrastructure projects going up. We were energy independent. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=264.0s)]
*  The most oil production in the world happening in the United States. And as this account says, and I agree, what's happened over the last few months has been nothing short of unnecessary and tragic, but it was Donald Trump and Musk taking a wrecking ball to the economy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=273.0s)]
*  That's a Trump supporter who posted that. That's somebody who voted for Donald Trump who is summing up what Donald Trump did to the economy. Just want to make sure that folks know that as well. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=290.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's a great point and it's why I even wanted to frame it that way in terms of if you don't want to listen to what I'm saying, even though I think we're coming with the objective data, that was, to your point, Brett, a Trump supporter. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=299.0s)]
*  Or just take a look here. This guy Spencer Akimian. He was not a Harris supporter or Trump supporter. He was certainly not a Biden supporter, this guy. You know, and I remember his post being like very anti-Biden. He posts things like this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=313.0s)]
*  It's a summary of the Bloomberg article from today. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=326.0s)]
*  And Akimian also posts, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=356.0s)]
*  People are not appreciating what a horrendous message the bond market is sending us. Yields are 20 basis points higher than November, back when we had 3% real GDP growth. We are having a substantial growth scare with stocks down like 20% from peaks, and yet bonds have gotten zero bid whatsoever. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=371.0s)]
*  Our credibility is shot and you will pay for it for decades to come. And I think when you see what Donald Trump is doing, it's not just the short-term pain. He's inflicting long-term credibility damage to the United States economy, which was not being abused the way Donald Trump has this mentality of everybody was laughing at us, everybody was going after us. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=394.0s)]
*  No, America was the richest nation in the world. We were leading the world as the place where money would go to as the most stable economy. And like Trump's done with his businesses in the past, he's taken a wrecking ball to it. He's broken it. He's breaking the dollar, breaking the bond market, Treasury yields, going to levels that they should not be at at all breath. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=419.0s)]
*  It's insane. And you know what Trump tries to do is, you know, what he tried to do in 2020, which he tried to take credit for, like the, and I don't even want to call it good stuff, but the good stuff that happened during the COVID pandemic. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=446.0s)]
*  Like the fact that oil prices collapsed because nobody was leaving their homes. Trump was like, look, oil prices are there with their way down right now. Look, no inflation. It's like, yeah, nobody's shopping. Everybody's locked in their homes because he allowed this virus to spread everywhere. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=460.0s)]
*  And everybody is terrified for their lives. See, Trump gave away the game a few weeks ago when he did that post on a social media platform where he said Trump is purposely trying to tank the economy. Remember that video he posted on a social media account? Trump is doing this all on purpose. It's all part of this grand plan, folks. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=474.0s)]
*  You just don't get it. You're just not smart enough. Well, all the stuff that Donald Trump has caused is actually the opposite of what he at least claimed to intend to do in that video. You see currently the bond market imploding. You see the 10 year Treasury yields soaring. You see the dollar crashing. You see inflation expectations sky high. So what does Donald Trump do? He tries to look for a scapegoat. In this case, he's trying to look for anybody he could blame. Do I blame China right now? Do I blame the Fed chair, Jerome Powell? I don't know. Let's just blame everybody because I'm not going to be able to do that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=491.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them say that it's my fault. And that's the stage that we are at right now. It's the blame game. Donald Trump never takes personal responsibility for everything. He's trying to shift the blame to all these various people. Meanwhile, he has created nightmare conditions that do the exact opposite of what he was hoping to accomplish, at least his stated goals. If Donald Trump's real intent, as described in that video that I'm speaking of, was to crash things such that the Federal Reserve had to lower rates in order to jumpstart [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=521.0s)]
*  this economy. He's done the worst job at it because all those indicators with inflation on the rise, with the dollar crashing, with the yield sky, all that stuff that makes the Fed go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. There's a lot of instability here. And if we were to lower the rates right now, we could supercharge inflation and make this problem even worse because we can't react like that. We need to follow the facts and follow the data. And that's exactly what Donald Trump doesn't want to do. He wants to put this fake jolt [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=551.0s)]
*  into the economy. By the way, this is kind of the same thing that caused the inflation in the first place, what Trump wants to do right now. Again, it's just a speed run of him destroying the economy exactly like we saw in 2020, but happening now at the top of his administration, utter chaos. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=581.0s)]
*  The point that you make is a great one. ProPublica did an exposé on Friday about how one of the things that the Trump regime is focused on is destroying all of the data so they can replace the true facts with their fake facts and fake news and then replace that and just have the propaganda prevail. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=596.0s)]
*  Brett, it's the exact same playbook that Donald Trump ran during COVID with basically the exact same players, except it's Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve instead of Dr. Fauci, but similar concept, right? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=615.0s)]
*  Renowned expert following facts, following science. So you attack an expert and then a foreign enemy, right? And then the foreign enemy that they go and attack is China. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=628.0s)]
*  And so over the weekend, too, Donald Trump would make posts like China is now interfering with the United States talks with Europe and it's China's fault now that Donald Trump can't get these deals done. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=639.0s)]
*  It was funny. I spoke with Jake Sullivan earlier in the day, former national security adviser under former President Biden. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=652.0s)]
*  And in addition to speaking to him, you know, I teach negotiations at law school and I've been involved in negotiations, not the type that Jake Sullivan as a national security adviser was involved in with foreign leaders. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=659.0s)]
*  But one of the things that you know in negotiations is you don't set arbitrary deadlines that you can't meet because you end up trapping yourself in your own deadlines if you can't meet it and then you lose your credibility in the negotiation when your adversary now knows that you're working under a time constraint. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=672.0s)]
*  So because Donald Trump tries to dominate the news cycle in a specific day but has no long term thinking or no thinking at all, he wakes up, he rage posts, he comes up with some ludicrous claim. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=693.0s)]
*  We're going to solve it in five days. We're going to do it in 90 days, 90 deals, 90 days, right? And it has this like headline impact that the media loves to run with. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=706.0s)]
*  But then you ultimately can't follow through with the plan. And when you can't follow through with the plan, the world sees, oh, wait a minute, we can play this out. He's going to get desperate. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=715.0s)]
*  Let's just wait it out into the deadline. And then he's going to have to, you know, push the deadline back or he's going to have to do a deal that's not a good deal for the United States. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=726.0s)]
*  I mean, when you're seeing like the Prime Minister of Japan, Aishiba, saying, you know, no, we're not going to do a new deal. We did a deal with you, Trump, in 2019. There was a deal with you. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=736.0s)]
*  So we're not going to renegotiate that deal. And then Prime Minister Aishiba says that Japan has grave concerns, grave concerns about the U.S. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=750.0s)]
*  overall approach to these tariffs. And he added that he won't rush to visit Washington in the coming days to strike a deal with Trump as, you know, they feel that their dignity has been attacked. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=761.0s)]
*  They feel that their honor has been taken away. And, you know, especially when you look at a lot of foreign cultures, and it should be in all cultures, frankly, trust in deal making good faith is a very important aspect. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=774.0s)]
*  And Trump has destroyed any form of good faith. I mean, Trump couldn't cut a deal with President Scheinbaum of Mexico. I mean, the deals that were supposed to be the easy ones, Trump is struggling there. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=788.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, you have China asserting itself in very strong ways. So for all of the things that Donald Trump was saying last week where he was lying, of course, I'm speaking to China. Of course, I'm doing this. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=801.0s)]
*  Of course, I'm doing this. Of course, I'm doing that. China is sending the exact opposite message. And I'll just show you what China is saying so you can have a real perspective. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=812.0s)]
*  But China firmly opposes any party, any country reaching a deal with the United States at the expense of China's interests. If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal matter because Trump's plan now is, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=820.0s)]
*  All right, everybody. Now you join us and isolate China and the other countries like you declared a trade war on us. Why would you join us? Why would we want to join you in anything at all? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=838.0s)]
*  And China's perspective is look, you want to cut a deal with the US do it, but don't cut a deal that screws us over. If you do that, we're going after you. So Trump's created this entire mess of a situation. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=850.0s)]
*  That's not just an unforced error. It's an obvious kind of malicious move that if your plan was to wreck the United States economy, you would do this. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=863.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Look, Trump is an unhinged maniac. The guy and the guy's just an idiot. And I don't feel bad saying that just so bluntly because he is. He has no idea what he's doing, nor does he care to actually try and help the American people. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=873.0s)]
*  What he's doing right now is hurting Americans greatly. It's hurting the world, quite frankly, because when America is weaker, the world is weaker and Trump's making us looking like the laughing stock of the entire world right now. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=888.0s)]
*  He has no clue what he's doing. He surrounded himself by a bunch of yes men that also have no idea what they're doing. And what's that creating? Just absolute chaos again at the expense of the American people. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=900.0s)]
*  I want to remind everybody the trade deal we currently have with Japan was cut by Donald Trump in 2019. He keeps reneging on his own trade deals. It's like the trade deal we had with Mexico and Canada that he says was done by an idiot. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=915.0s)]
*  I agree it was. It was done by you, Donald Trump. You did that trade deal. You did the trade deal with Japan. And now you want to act like, oh, we need this is all unfair. We need to do something. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=929.0s)]
*  But this is why none of these countries ultimately are going to trust you. One of the issues that Trump is running against in all of these areas is that there's nobody in the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, who can articulate what they actually want out of these negotiations. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=939.0s)]
*  Because they pick these fights without actually thinking through what it is they wanted. A lot of these countries, I think Japan might be one of them, like we don't have a trade deficit with. We have trade surpluses that defeats the entire purpose of what Donald Trump is even claiming to do. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=955.0s)]
*  So how are you going to solve this? Right? He wants some sort of ceremonial, right? He wants that Fox News headline at the other mainstream media. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=968.0s)]
*  He's a real deal runner. Donald Trump cuts a deal with Japan. He cuts a deal with this country. And he can't even get a fake deal done because he can't articulate what it is that he actually wants out of these deals. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=975.0s)]
*  If you asked everybody in this administration, what do you hope to achieve? All of them would give you different responses. Every single one. It was just like when Donald Trump announced this and you would speak to one person and you'd go, so is this a negotiating tactic? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=985.0s)]
*  You'd go, no, not a negotiating tactic. You'd speak to somebody else. They'd go, hell yeah, it's a negotiating tactic. Art of the deal. And you'd be like, okay, I just spoke to five different people. I got five different answers. So what the heck is it that you want? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=998.0s)]
*  And when you do that, you don't provide stability to the markets. It's the reason why we're seeing the markets continue to crash. I'm sure Donald Trump lashing out at the Federal Reserve chair isn't helping things either. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1009.0s)]
*  And if Trump continues down this road and actually tries to oust Jerome Powell from the Federal Reserve, all of these stock market crashes that we have seen to this point will look like losing pennies compared to what will happen to the markets and to the global markets. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1019.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Sorry, I just wanted to add this. The behavior is too erratic right now. Erratic in a way that honestly, the only conclusion, again, that I keep drawing here, and I'm not giving him an out with this and I'm not saying this for clicks. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1033.0s)]
*  He's not cognitively all there. He's just not. He says one thing one day, then changes his mind, then he's very aggressive and angry and attacks this person or that person. There's no clear and concise message here other than just like crazy, erratic behavior. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1046.0s)]
*  And it's something that I think we all just need to continue to really look at. Look, do we honestly think the person, woman, man, chair, TV guy got better over the last five years or worse? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1062.0s)]
*  And so seeing his behavior here, the only conclusion again that I'm drawing here is he's not well, genuinely. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1072.0s)]
*  Well, put yourself in the shoes of a foreign country or just someone doing business right now with the United States. You take a look. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1079.0s)]
*  You're like, well, what's our adversary in the negotiation or partner in a negotiation doing right now? So you take a look at the official White House account and the official White House account there posting memes of the United States Senator, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1088.0s)]
*  AI images with like MS-13 tattoos on the person's head and mocking Democratic senators. You see posts like this on Easter breaking. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1104.0s)]
*  This is from the official White House account breaking. The White House is no longer a nursing home. And then it goes, hashtag White House Easter egg roll. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1115.0s)]
*  This is a video that the White House and Trump posted. They think that this video makes Trump look good. I don't even know what Trump is saying in this video. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1127.0s)]
*  Like, Jordy, to your point, he looks not well. They're trying to mock former President Biden. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1136.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's basically right around the same age as former President Biden. And just watch. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1143.0s)]
*  They think that this is Donald Trump at his peak right here on Easter. And again, it does not look good. Here, play this clip. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1151.0s)]
*  You remember the bunny with Joe Biden? Remember? You remember when the bunny took Joe Biden out? He's not going to take, he's not taking Trump out anyway. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1158.0s)]
*  Remember when the bunny took Joe Biden? What are they even talking about there? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1171.0s)]
*  So put yourself again in the shoes of somebody looking at the United States right now. You see something like that. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1176.0s)]
*  And then you see Caroline Levitt, who's asked a question about disappearing migrants to concentration camps in El Salvador. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1183.0s)]
*  You're seeing a United States Supreme Court that ruled 9-0 to return Abrego Garcia, facilitate his return. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1195.0s)]
*  You are seeing even recently in what was, I guess, a dissenting opinion in the recent Supreme Court order at 1 a.m. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1204.0s)]
*  to block Trump from sending the next group of victims, migrant victims, from Texas to the concentration camps in El Salvador. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1214.0s)]
*  It was 7-2. But even the two, they were against Donald Trump. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1224.0s)]
*  They just said, we trust that Donald Trump won't do it until there's further orders from the court. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1230.0s)]
*  Because the Trump regime said, don't worry, we're not going to deport these people as they were loading up the buses. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1236.0s)]
*  The seven other Supreme Court justices were like, you know what? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1243.0s)]
*  We can't even take the word of the executive branch anymore when they tell us that they're not going to do something. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1247.0s)]
*  So we have to issue an order. That's why it was 7-2 versus unanimous. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1254.0s)]
*  The two still said that Trump shouldn't send the people to El Salvador. They just said, we don't think he's going to do it. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1258.0s)]
*  It was Clarence Thomas and Alito. And it was like, really, you don't think they're going to do it? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1265.0s)]
*  They're literally loading up the buses right now. They're lying to you. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1269.0s)]
*  So then you have Caroline Levitt, Donald Trump's chief propagandist. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1272.0s)]
*  She's on Fox this morning. And so whereas the Trump DOJ wrote in multiple briefings that it was a mistake to send to Brego Garcia, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1276.0s)]
*  she now goes out and says it wasn't a mistake. It wasn't a mistake. We did it on purpose. Of course we did it on purpose. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1286.0s)]
*  He's a terrorist. Here, play this clip. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1292.0s)]
*  Senator Kennedy did come out and say, yeah, this guy looks like a really bad guy. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1294.0s)]
*  But the administration made a mistake sending him to El Salvador. Do you feel that way? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1298.0s)]
*  We did not make a mistake. We have always maintained that this was an individual who needed to be deported from our country. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1303.0s)]
*  The president swore to the American public he was going to deport illegal criminals, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1310.0s)]
*  and especially those who have been involved in violent gangs like MS-13 that have terrorized American communities. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1315.0s)]
*  And so to the Democrat Party, who thinks that they are going to bring this foreign terrorist back to the United States of America to live a peaceful and happy life, that is never going to happen. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1322.0s)]
*  Just think about the middle finger they're giving to the United States Supreme Court. A 9-0 opinion. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1332.0s)]
*  Bring Abrego Garcia back. A 2019 immigration judge said that Abrego Garcia has no criminal history. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1338.0s)]
*  Put a withholding order in place saying you can't send him to El Salvador. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1346.0s)]
*  If you want to deport him to another country, you can deport him to another country, but not El Salvador. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1351.0s)]
*  He got a work permit from the first Trump administration. A work permit. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1356.0s)]
*  So he was able to work, and he just had to show up once a year, check in with ICE, and he could work in Maryland. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1361.0s)]
*  That's what was happening. And then you see Donald Trump in office, a felon, a sexual predator, someone found liable for sexual abuse, a fraud, engage in this behavior and engage in fraud. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1368.0s)]
*  We never made a mistake. We never did this. And now you're hearing all of the stories, Brett and Jordy, about other people, American citizens who are being detained. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1383.0s)]
*  You're hearing stories about people who are backpacking in the United States, who are put in ICE detention centers, strip searched. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1394.0s)]
*  They spend days in a detention center before they get deported back to their countries. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1404.0s)]
*  And it's a real no wonder that there is what Goldman Sachs is predicting. $90 billion in tourism will be affected by this. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1411.0s)]
*  I think it's going to be more, but it's like Donald Trump has now destroyed the dollar, destroyed the bond market, destroyed tourism, prevents the United States from getting labor that it needs, destroyed our markets, and went after migrants with no criminal history. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1421.0s)]
*  And guess what with the whole thing here? Former President Biden deported more people monthly than Donald Trump did. More people under Biden ended up getting deported. He just didn't do it like a maniac. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1442.0s)]
*  He focused on people with criminal records, actual criminal records, and just did the hard work quietly. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1453.0s)]
*  Yeah, I see all these MAGA people online going like, wait, they accidentally make an admission that they don't want to make when they say stuff like this. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1459.0s)]
*  But they say stuff like, but you know, Biden and Obama, they deported way more people than Donald Trump ever did. And the courts never came after them once, not even once. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1465.0s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, let's let's try to follow this logic. Okay, perhaps it's because they deported the right people and not random people off the street because they were upset about their numbers. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1474.0s)]
*  So they tried to fluff them by abducting people off the street and sending them to prisons. Maybe it's because they did something legally. They followed the law. They did things the right way. Perhaps that is why. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1485.0s)]
*  And they're just much better at their jobs. And I just want to pause for one second because the stuff that Caroline Levitt, yes, it's nuts. Yes, we know it's nuts. Yes, the stuff Donald Trump says is nuts. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1495.0s)]
*  But it's really, really nefarious stuff that they're doing here. I mean, this is a guy who was a union member, a father working in Maryland. And for them to just keep ramping up this rhetoric and go, he's gang member. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1505.0s)]
*  He's MS-13. He's MS-13. He's MS-13. Okay, where's the proof? Well, we don't have any proof, but he's MS-13. He's MS-13. Then all of a sudden, a couple days later, they go, oh, he's a terrorist. He's a terrorist. He's a terrorist. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1518.0s)]
*  This is very strong language to be using about an individual. You don't just throw around that somebody's a terrorist lightly. The fact that the government of the United States of America is doing this is absolutely appalling. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1528.0s)]
*  If they could say it about this individual, they could say it about anybody here. And all we are saying here is just stand up for the Constitution. Whether you're a Republican, a Democrat, an independent, I don't care where you are on the aisle. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1540.0s)]
*  This is about doing what is right by the United States Constitution. This is giving somebody their due process rights. If you truly believe that this person is who you say it is, then instead of airing it out on Fox News or on your Twitter feed or your truth social feed, air it out in the courtroom. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1551.0s)]
*  Let the court of law decide on these matters. You do not have a right as president of the United States to whisk somebody off the street. Send them to an El Salvadoran concentration camp to spend the rest of their lives when they have not been convicted of anything. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1566.0s)]
*  We have a lot to discuss on this episode. When we come back, we got to talk about the breaking news from this weekend that Pete Hegseth involved in more classified signal communications of war plans on this other text thread that we learned about. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1581.0s)]
*  Hegseth is a person who has been talking about communications with his wife, his brother, his personal lawyer, also some of the top people who work at the Department of Defense getting fired by Hegseth. Hegseth's spokesperson, a Trump-er, resigns, and then Hegseth blaming the deep state and all these deep state leaks when it's actually the people who he hired. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1597.0s)]
*  Like these Trump-ers who are now saying they're thinking about doing wrongful termination lawsuits against Hegseth. I mean, who would have ever thought that if you pick a Fox News Sunday host to lead the Department of Defense, someone whose background was absolutely appalling, that they would get into power and do appalling things? Who could ever predict that? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1619.0s)]

*  Well, in terms of the Department of Defense, a senior official working there who's close to Hegseth describes the situation as, quote, a complete and utter meltdown taking place. So Hegseth's core team is chief of staff, senior advisor, deputy chief of staff, deputy secretary, chief of staff. They were all fired on Friday or pushed out as Hegseth and others, I guess, were accusing them of leaking information. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1871.0s)]
*  And these are like Hegseth's people. They deny it. I think that some of them are threatening litigation against Hegseth for the way in which they were fired. You have a spokesperson who was the top spokesperson at the Department of Defense. Again, like a friend of Hegseth, a guy by the name of John Elliott, he came out with an op-ed for Politico basically saying that Hegseth needs to go. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1899.0s)]
*  And that was before we learned that Hegseth was involved in having other classified communications on signal text message threads with his wife, who doesn't work at the Department of Defense, his brother, who he got a job at the Department of Defense, but why is he having communications with them, his personal connections with them, his personal connections with them, and so on. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1916.0s)]
*  And also if you go back with Hegseth, his whole shtick, remember, during the confirmation hearings was he would say, you know, when it would be people who would accuse him of doing horrific things, right, you know, accusations of sexual assault, right, he would say, you know, he would say, you know, he would say, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=1931.0s)]

*  There was just such a mountain of evidence. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=2000.76s)]
*  I mean, then the fact that this guy had never led like a military command before, he has no experience working at the Pentagon. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=2003.12s)]
*  I mean, the organizations that he led, these two, you know, smaller nonprofits. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=2011.46s)]
*  So again, it was not a shock to learn that he was involved in more inappropriate conduct [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=2017.1s)]
*  But also the way the White House is handling it just shows you again the lack of confidence [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=2022.04s)]

*  Fake news. Okay, then you had their chief propagandist Caroline Levitt go out and [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=2060.64s)]
*  You know, she was just spewing [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=2067.32s)]

*  With how the trump regime wants people at harvard to think that was literally in the letter sent by the trump regime to harvard [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3045.52s)]
*  Harvard responded and said no we're not doing this harvard was represented by [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3053.1200000000003s)]

*  Trump administration, but the trump regime said that that letter was a mistake [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3065.6s)]
*  But they still blamed harvard for responding to it [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3070.72s)]
*  The way they did and the trump regime said we didn't mean to send this letter, but harvard you should have realized [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3074.64s)]
*  That this letter was a draft and that it wasn't the final letter that we were going to send [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3081.52s)]
*  So you now embarrassed us by publishing the letter that you received and then publishing your letter back to us [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3087.52s)]
*  So now we're going to have to retaliate against you because you made us look bad [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3095.7599999999998s)]
*  By your response to the letter that we mistakenly sent you so the trump regime began end of last week [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3100.88s)]
*  Saying we're going to take away 2.2 billion dollars in federal funds [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3108.3199999999997s)]
*  Then they upped the ante over the weekend saying that there's another billion dollars in funds and again mind you [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3112.24s)]
*  The trump regime had said that this letter was a mistake like it wasn't supposed to go out [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3118.08s)]
*  But they're pissed that harvard didn't recognize that it was a mistake [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3122.08s)]
*  So harvard had enough they filed the lawsuit the president of harvard university alan garber announced the lawsuit [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3125.36s)]
*  And basically said moments ago [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3132.3199999999997s)]
*  We filed a lawsuit to halt the funding freeze because it's unlawful and beyond the government's authority [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3133.7599999999998s)]
*  And it goes on to say the government has cited the university's response to anti-semitism [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3140.1600000000003s)]
*  As a justification to for its unlawful action as a jew and an american [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3145.76s)]
*  I know very well there are valid concerns about rising anti-semitism to address it effectively [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3150.32s)]
*  We've dealt with that before and then they go on to say or we've been dealing with it [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3155.92s)]
*  It goes on to say the consequences of the government's overreach will be severe and long-lasting [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3159.92s)]
*  Restarts that the government has put in jeopardy includes efforts to improve the prospects of children who survive cancer [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3165.14s)]
*  To understand at the molecular level how cancer spreads throughout the body to predict the spread of infectious disease outbreaks [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3171.7s)]
*  And to ease the pain of soldiers wounded on the battlefield and it goes on and on and on from there [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3178.8999999999996s)]
*  We'll be doing a full breakdown of that lawsuit, but I just want to get this straight brett and jordy and might as money [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3185.62s)]
*  So the trump regime says sending that harvard letter was a mistake [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3190.74s)]
*  But now they have to go after harvard because harvard responded to the letter that was a mistake the reciprocal tara formula [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3194.34s)]
*  Was a made-up erroneous formula the trump regime fired researchers working on ebola [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3201.78s)]
*  They fired people who work with nuclear weapons. They said that was a mistake [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3209.06s)]
*  Um, they fought they are involved in classified communications on signal chats [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3214.9s)]
*  Inviting reporters onto these chats they say that was a mistake [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3220.42s)]
*  The trump doj admitted that sending a brego to garcia to el salvador [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3224.9s)]
*  Was a mistake although now they're saying that's not a mistake and it was on purpose again. It is gross incompetence [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3230.98s)]
*  Or you can say willfully malicious at this point, but it is this raw incompetence that pervades this trump regime [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3237.54s)]
*  Mistakes are made is an expression that my wife uses sometimes they happen, but mostly mistakes are made [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3246.9s)]
*  There's a reason why trump has bankrupted all of his businesses or I should say many of his businesses [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3253.78s)]
*  Not quite all of them, but many of his businesses in the past [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3259.54s)]
*  It is because he makes these exact same moves over and over again [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3263.38s)]
*  And he doubles and triples down on the errors. He covers them up mistakes become catastrophes [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3268.82s)]
*  Catastrophes become bankruptcies and you see that's how he's handling everything right now. Just a complete and utter disaster [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3274.82s)]
*  I mean you just take something even like um, donald trump promising peace in ukraine [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3281.7200000000003s)]
*  In 24 hours, right? That was the trump promise. We will bring peace to ukraine in 24 hours. I guarantee you [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3287.7200000000003s)]
*  It will be very easy to do [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3294.36s)]
*  Now what are they saying at the end of last week? [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3296.76s)]
*  The [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3299.7200000000003s)]
*  The negotiations are too tough for them. They're tired of the negotiations [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3300.6000000000004s)]
*  The parties aren't coming to an agreement quick enough [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3305.88s)]
*  We tried it's not our fault anymore. We didn't do it blame it on biden blame it on zelinski [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3308.92s)]
*  They don't blame it on putin who actually did the unlawful invasion [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3315.2400000000002s)]
*  We made this clip showing what trump promised and what marco rubio and trump are now saying and again [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3318.92s)]
*  They set some fake deadline for themselves we're gonna do it in 24 hours [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3325.64s)]
*  It doesn't happen and they make more fake deadlines [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3330.36s)]
*  It doesn't happen and putin looks at it and they're and putin's like, all right [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3333.32s)]
*  These people are not for real and then the rest of the world looks at it and says oh got it [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3337.08s)]
*  These people are pathetic and so europe forms its own alliances with ukraine and [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3341.56s)]
*  Australia and canada and america now just finds itself isolated economically [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3347.14s)]
*  Isolated geopolitically when it comes to um, you know our our alliances [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3352.7599999999998s)]
*  For for foreign protection here. Just watch this clip that we put together and the war in ukraine in 24 hours [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3358.2999999999997s)]
*  Yes, how would you do that? Uh, I know zelinski very well [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3364.7799999999997s)]
*  I'll end that war between those two countries in 24 hours [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3368.22s)]
*  It won't even take that long [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3373.18s)]
*  No one's saying it's going to be done in 12 hours [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3375.2599999999998s)]
*  But we want to see how far apart it is and whether those differences are can even be uh narrow [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3377.5s)]
*  So we came here yesterday to sort of begin to talk about [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3383.0200000000004s)]
*  More specific outlines of what it might take to end the war [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3386.94s)]
*  To try to figure out very soon and i'm talking about a matter of days not a matter of weeks [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3390.1400000000003s)]
*  Whether or not this is the war that can be ended if for some reason, uh, one of the two parties makes it [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3394.86s)]
*  very difficult [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3400.94s)]
*  We're just going to say you're foolish. You're fools. You're horrible people and [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3402.6200000000003s)]
*  We're gonna just take a pass [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3406.94s)]
*  That's the negotiation strategy. We're gonna say you're foolish. You're fools [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3408.94s)]
*  You're a fool and we're gonna take a pass [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3413.98s)]
*  Then even marco rubio. He's like no one said it's gonna be done in 12 hours [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3416.54s)]
*  But we're gonna do it in a few days like again, why are you continuing to create? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3420.38s)]
*  A made-up deadline for yourself [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3425.82s)]
*  Do you see how they keep on doing that over and over again? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3427.82s)]
*  And jake sullivan said it to me perfectly go watch that full interview. He said [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3430.94s)]
*  Because [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3435.42s)]
*  Their whole thing is winning the news cycle in a day versus actually they just wake up [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3436.78s)]
*  How could they hog attention in the day versus actually come up with a coherent strategy? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3443.02s)]
*  Because they're so used to the disinformation when former president biden was, uh, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3448.94s)]
*  Leading and it was like, okay [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3455.02s)]
*  Let's just watch it and then just flood the zone with lie lie lie lie, but they can't plan ahead guys [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3456.22s)]
*  Even with stories like this it's telling the story about homeland security secretary christy gnomes bag [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3461.18s)]
*  Including three thousand dollars in cash was stolen from a dc restaurant. Like how does it even happen? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3469.18s)]
*  You're the homeland security secretary, which means you obviously have secret service and people who are there with you [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3475.5s)]
*  Why do you have three thousand dollars in cash? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3483.34s)]
*  In your pocketbook at a dc restaurant [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3487.2599999999998s)]
*  That doesn't sound like a great deal of confidence competence right there that that's happening, but it's just [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3491.2599999999998s)]
*  Every day with these people it's it's uh, it is a unmitigated clown show then not to mention you have trump [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3497.8999999999996s)]
*  He was at his virginia golf club [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3505.74s)]
*  like he lies to the press and pretended that he was at like easter services, um, and like [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3507.5s)]
*  Intentionally left like his schedule vague while he had like his faith team go out and say donald trump's like you're doing all these services [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3513.4s)]
*  Total bs trump was golfing. Um all day wearing this weird gulf of america hat [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3521.34s)]
*  And then just posting the weirdest messages in the world just post after post after post [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3527.58s)]
*  I don't want to read all of these things, but it's just these like these like incredibly deranged posts like [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3532.7000000000003s)]
*  Like this one goes since our announcement of liberation day many world leaders and business executives [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3538.8599999999997s)]
*  Have come to me asking for relief from tariffs. It's good to see that the world knows we are serious because we are [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3545.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3552.06s)]
*  What serious person goes and posts we are serious and they go they must they must write the wrongs of decades of abuse [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3553.18s)]
*  But it won't be easy for them like what you're doing a scavenger hunt [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3561.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna put you through a challenge because we're serious people and i'm writing [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3565.4199999999996s)]
*  We're serious people then he posts like in all caps the businessmen who criticize tariffs are bad at business [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3569.1s)]
*  But really bad at politics. They don't understand or realize that I am the greatest friend that american [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3575.18s)]
*  Capitalism has ever had and happy easter to all including radical left lunatics [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3581.64s)]
*  Fighting and scheming to bring home murderers then he calls today this morning [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3587.2599999999998s)]
*  The chairman of the federal reserve jerome powell he calls him a major loser [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3592.06s)]
*  What what president calls the chairman of the federal reserve a major loser and just mocks him and bullies him and harasses him [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3598.7s)]
*  It's just not normal [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3606.2999999999997s)]
*  Behavior it reflects someone who is erratic unstable [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3608.6s)]
*  Not serious and the world sees that the markets see that [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3612.7799999999997s)]
*  Our adversaries see that our allies see that right but but the people are rising up [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3617.98s)]
*  Yeah, i'll also add it also shows that he's weak and utterly incompetent at everything that he's doing [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3622.5400000000004s)]
*  He can't get anything done [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3627.9s)]
*  So his only move is the same move that he always goes to which is to lash out at other people [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3629.5800000000004s)]
*  And so you see him and rubio doing that with the ukraine situation you see them doing that in all facets [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3634.1400000000003s)]
*  It's just attack attack attack attack rather than just take a moment and actually take a little bit of responsibility for your actions [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3639.26s)]
*  I think that really shows weakness this inability to admit you're wrong this inability to say [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3646.3799999999997s)]
*  Like there shouldn't even be this protracted fight right now to get kilmaro bravo garcia back from el salvador [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3651.8199999999997s)]
*  The second that they admitted we sent this guy over there due to an administrative error [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3657.42s)]
*  He should have been on the next flight home all of these people who they're sending there [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3661.18s)]
*  Because there are many other people who are there who have done nothing wrong who have not had their day in court [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3665.74s)]
*  I'd say most of the people there in addition to kilmaro brave garcia whose names are being forgotten right now [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3671.5s)]
*  Because of the attention. Um, you know, there's not enough attention to go around sometimes [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3677.1800000000003s)]
*  All those people should be back home [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3681.7400000000002s)]
*  This shouldn't be a fight when you admit that you have made these mistakes correct the mistake or say I we screw it up [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3683.1s)]
*  Hexets screwed up. Here's how we're going to take care of it [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3690.06s)]
*  That's what actual leaders do not whatever the hell we're seeing right here and the world leaders right now [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3692.38s)]
*  They're just mocking donald trump [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3697.42s)]
*  They just know that they could go to anybody else and cut these deals and and just isolate the united states for everything because the united [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3699.1800000000003s)]
*  States has isolated themselves from the rest of the world [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3705.1800000000003s)]
*  It's like the worst negotiating position imaginable as ron philip kowski our editor in chief continues to tally. It's now been 10 days [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3707.98s)]
*  Since peter navarro went on fox business and said we're going to get 90 deals done in 90 days [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3715.26s)]
*  We're going to get a deal done per day. You'll see after 90 days 90 deals are going to happen [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3720.3s)]
*  It's been 10 days since the virus said that zero trade deals have been executed [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3724.54s)]
*  At the time that we are live on this episode just complete utter incompetence and failure [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3730.06s)]
*  But like ben said the people are rising up [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3735.6600000000003s)]
*  I want to give another shout out to all the people who are out there at the [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3737.9s)]
*  5051 events um, these protests were absolutely incredible this week [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3742.12s)]
*  And I gotta say like pretty big crowds considering the fact that there were protests like a couple weeks ago [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3746.62s)]
*  But people just continue to show up in numbers. I saw people in the big cities [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3751.8199999999997s)]
*  I saw people in the small towns. I saw people in like munich germany [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3755.98s)]
*  I saw people all over the world out there protesting donald trump protesting elon musk side note [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3759.34s)]
*  Uh, did the wisconsin supreme court race just completely break elon musk or what? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3765.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like the guy's kind of disappeared ever since then and and you know [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3770.62s)]
*  I'm thinking of trump's comment too where he says the people who are against tariffs are bad at business [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3774.22s)]
*  Well, why don't you look at some of the people in your own administration like elon musk who is against the tariffs [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3778.86s)]
*  Are you calling elon musk bad at business? Maybe you want to have that conversation with him as well [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3783.1s)]
*  But these protests out there seeing the people on the streets [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3787.6600000000003s)]
*  It really inspires hope and I want to thank everybody for for being there all the creativity of your signs ron [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3791.1800000000003s)]
*  Philip kowski on mitasplus.com [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3796.6200000000003s)]
*  He did a great job cataloging some of the best signs that were spotted at many of these events from across the world [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3799.1800000000003s)]
*  You should check it out. Um, like I said earlier [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3805.58s)]
*  We also saw so many people from minus touch out there, uh, like supporters listeners people who are out there [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJaD7JyNomQ&t=3807.82s)]
