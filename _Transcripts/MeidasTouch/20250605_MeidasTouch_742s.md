# MAGA Mike in PANIC MODE as Trump GETS EXPOSED
**MeidasTouch:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8)
*  The Republicans on Capitol Hill are in a crisis mode right now after Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump and Elon Musk are attacking each other. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=4.82s)]
*  Maga Mike Johnson, about a few hours ago, showed up in the hall carrying his [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=8.02s)]
*  chief of staff's baby as a prop, I guess, to try to avoid some of the tougher [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=12.9s)]
*  questions or questions that Elon Musk is saying that Donald Trump's DOJ is [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=18.5s)]
*  covering up the Epstein files because Trump's name is all over it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=24.7s)]
*  And I guess Maga Mike believes if he's carrying a baby, no one's going to ask [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=28.14s)]
*  him about Epstein. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=31.42s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=32.22s)]
*  And we're hearing all hell is breaking loose right now at the White House. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=52.06s)]
*  Trump advisors, New York Times, we're supporting, are prepared to force the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=55.9s)]
*  various allies on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=60.46s)]
*  Who are they going to choose? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=63.62s)]
*  And you need to choose tonight. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=64.7s)]
*  Are you going to choose Elon or are you going to choose Donald Trump? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=65.94s)]
*  We also hear Trump is being advised by Bannon to launch a number of criminal [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=69.46s)]
*  and civil investigations into Elon Musk and potentially deporting Elon Musk for [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=74.66s)]
*  being a undocumented immigrant here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=80.94s)]
*  I want to bring in Democratic Congress member Jared Muskowitz and first [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=85.02s)]
*  Congressman, I just want to get your overall reaction to what's transpired today. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=88.33999999999999s)]
*  Well, the girls are fighting. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=94.13999999999999s)]
*  And so, yeah, I mean, wild. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  And you know, the thing about this is, is that, you know, when you have a divorce [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=101.78s)]
*  and I'm a child of divorce, right, you know, the kids get caught in the middle. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=107.46s)]
*  And so, like, you know, who's who's who's going to get some of these folks, you [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=112.42s)]
*  know, big balls, obviously, I'm worried about him. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=117.18s)]
*  He's a child. Who's going to get him? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=119.14s)]
*  I mean, maybe maybe it's something like, you know, Trump gets weekdays and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=123.5s)]
*  Elon will get weekends and holidays. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=127.66s)]
*  This is this is worse than Democrats thought it would be. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=131.54s)]
*  It happened way faster. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=135.34s)]
*  Man, did it evolve? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=137.5s)]
*  We went from I don't like the bill to you're in the Epstein files to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=138.82s)]
*  you should be impeached. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=145.54s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, listen, just another day here on on Capitol Hill. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=148.54s)]
*  Well, you know, they Trump DOJ did say, was it three months ago that they were [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=154.98s)]
*  going to immediately release those Epstein files and then they haven't. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=160.57999999999998s)]
*  And we've heard conflicting things from Pam Bondi and Cash Patel and Dan Bond, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=164.78s)]
*  Gino, and they certainly do seem to be not wanting to release those files. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=170.14000000000001s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=175.22s)]
*  I don't know. You're going to be seeing a lot of my Republican colleagues [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=176.02s)]
*  anymore saying release the files. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=178.14000000000001s)]
*  Well, didn't you have Annapolina Luna from Florida? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=181.86s)]
*  Her whole thing is they were going to be releasing these files and she made that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=186.14000000000001s)]
*  her like major cause. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=189.86s)]
*  We're releasing the Epstein files. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=191.86s)]
*  She's gone off the silent. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=193.34s)]
*  Yeah, again, I don't know that Republicans right now are going to be [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=195.66s)]
*  asking to release the files. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=199.38s)]
*  But, you know, this is I mean, watching Mike Johnson hold that baby. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=201.46s)]
*  I mean, look at that baby wanted the hell out of that situation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=204.9s)]
*  But I mean, literally, he's like, I have a brilliant idea, guys. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=209.74s)]
*  I'm going to use I'm going to use a baby to put a force field around me. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  But look, this is this has real repercussions for them. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=218.9s)]
*  And whether whether this eventually gets mediated or negotiated, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=222.46s)]
*  whether Trump appoints Marco Rubio to a sixth thing like special envoy [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=228.38s)]
*  to handle this, one won't know. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=233.46s)]
*  But this has real implications for Mike Johnson and for Thune [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=237.02s)]
*  if they're going to lose their largest donor and someone who might [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=240.5s)]
*  to start primaring Republicans. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=244.9s)]
*  And so, look, it's early Democrats, you know, obviously, you know, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=247.22s)]
*  I don't know that we're not out there celebrating. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=251.66s)]
*  We should just hang back. This is this is, you know, they, you know, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=254.06s)]
*  look, Elon's like an ex-boyfriend. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=258.14s)]
*  OK, I know he's buying us flowers right now, but we're still very upset. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=260.14s)]
*  OK, it's going to have to woo us a little more. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=264.66s)]
*  I'm unimpressed so far. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  I think he should go further. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=269.62s)]
*  But but I mean, there's real repercussions for the Republicans, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=272.46000000000004s)]
*  not just on the big, beautiful bill, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=275.78000000000003s)]
*  but on what this means for the midterms. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=279.62s)]
*  We're we're a year away from being in full swing. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=281.34s)]
*  Right. You know, maybe less than that. Six months. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=286.09999999999997s)]
*  You know, because I think their plan was passed the big, beautiful bill. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=290.26s)]
*  And then you're going to go right into reelection season. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=292.38s)]
*  So this is a real problem for them. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=294.42s)]
*  Let's talk about how it can impact, though, the budget bill. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=297.94s)]
*  It's currently in the Senate right now. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=300.53999999999996s)]
*  And then with Elon Musk making all of these posts, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=303.38s)]
*  what was interesting that I found is you had all of these Republican [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=306.62s)]
*  Congress members who voted for this disastrous budget bill [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=310.5s)]
*  come out against the bill they voted for. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=314.86s)]
*  But their justification for that is the reason we voted for this [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=317.58s)]
*  is to hand it over to the Senate. Oh, yeah. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=322.26s)]
*  We need to get some piece of shit out of here, right, to give it over to the Senate. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=324.82s)]
*  And they're going to make it beautiful. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=329.5s)]
*  We made it big. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=331.22s)]
*  They're going to make it beautiful. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=332.54s)]
*  And they'll send it back over. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=334.5s)]
*  By the way, that's putting a lot of faith into the Senate. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=336.38s)]
*  I've never heard Republican House members talk like that before. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=338.41999999999996s)]
*  But come on, look, they've broken all of their promises [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  about tackling the debt, about not touching Medicaid, right, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=345.65999999999997s)]
*  about making government more efficient. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=348.97999999999996s)]
*  I mean, what's name one thing that's more efficient. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=350.9s)]
*  It's a shame they destroyed FEMA because right now the West Wing [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=353.34s)]
*  probably could use a FEMA declaration for the disaster that's going on. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=356.7s)]
*  And so look, they're they I mean, if I were Republican right now, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=361.9s)]
*  I mean, I would literally claim I had covid and wear a mask. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=366.18s)]
*  OK, and get on the first plane out of here. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=370.02s)]
*  It wouldn't it wouldn't surprise me if they canceled votes soon [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=373.74s)]
*  just to get out of here. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=377.74s)]
*  You know, put your head in a garbage can for the next couple of days, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=379.82s)]
*  because there's there's no winning here. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, look, I expect all of them to side with with Trump on this mostly. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=383.97999999999996s)]
*  But, you know, they're trying to side with Elon on the bill. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=389.09999999999997s)]
*  Elon's telling the truth on the bill. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=391.94s)]
*  A broken clock is right twice a day. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=393.26s)]
*  The bill is going to add two and a half trillion dollars to the debt. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=394.90000000000003s)]
*  It is going to do that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=399.18s)]
*  And and it is going to push further into, you know, increasing our interest [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=401.58000000000004s)]
*  payments, further borrowing money on foreign countries. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=405.94s)]
*  And it's not necessary to do. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=409.1s)]
*  The big piece of it is the tax cuts. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=412.5s)]
*  Right now, those people are paying thirty seven point six, me included. OK. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=415.14s)]
*  Without the bill, we would go to thirty nine. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=420.90000000000003s)]
*  We were at thirty nine previously. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=423.54s)]
*  We were we were doing fine. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=425.3s)]
*  Right. We don't have to put that debt onto our grandkids just so. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=427.58000000000004s)]
*  So to keep my taxes from going up from one point four percent, one point four percent. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=431.34000000000003s)]
*  This whole thing, right, is over one point four percent. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=436.34000000000003s)]
*  But, you know, Elon's like Regina George right now. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=440.5s)]
*  I he's making a burn book. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=443.78000000000003s)]
*  You can send it to Mars. Who knows? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=445.5s)]
*  You know, one of the things that worries me is if you want it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=448.5s)]
*  One of the things that worries you. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=452.18s)]
*  Well, it's it's an over. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=454.46000000000004s)]
*  At this moment in this timeline, I'm waiting for Thanos to show up and snap his fingers. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=456.7s)]
*  Well, he will. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=461.7s)]
*  The one thing is pretty much all encompassing that Donald Trump has set up traps [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  and across the entire economy, whether we're looking at [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=468.62s)]
*  this point, people being unable to pay back their credit card debt, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=473.58000000000004s)]
*  being like the highest ever, what he's done with student loans [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=477.58000000000004s)]
*  and starting collection efforts precipitously, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=481.06s)]
*  people not being able to pay those back and at harming their credit scores. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=483.9s)]
*  Obviously, the tariffs against the world were not seeing [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=489.06s)]
*  the ships really coming back into the ports, the frequency they were before. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=493.18s)]
*  What he's done with FEMA, he wants to make Fannie and Freddie [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=497.38s)]
*  basically take that out of the government again. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=501.9s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's just kind of everything. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=504.54s)]
*  And my my the big worry here is any one of those things. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=506.5s)]
*  Can become the kind of, you know, whatever that breaks the camel's back, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=511.22s)]
*  the straw that broke the camp. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=515.46s)]
*  It's it's it's just throughout everything at this point. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=516.98s)]
*  And all he can do is have you not bought a condo in Gaza yet? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=520.02s)]
*  I mean, look, this is, you know, all of the stuff all of the time with with the president. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=523.74s)]
*  And so, yeah, look, there's a lot of bad stuff that went on in the first six months. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=529.78s)]
*  I think they turned the government into Newark Airport. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=534.06s)]
*  They broke a lot of these departments. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=536.58s)]
*  And now they're like, well, we broke what we have to use. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=537.94s)]
*  And now, like, they're trying to figure out, they're trying to figure out, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=540.82s)]
*  you know, what what to do. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=543.7s)]
*  And so, yeah, look, there's a lot of people struggling. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=545.34s)]
*  I mean, look, we should watch what they do and stop listening to what they say. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=547.98s)]
*  Right. They said they were going to lower food costs. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=553.82s)]
*  Right. They said they were going to end the Ukraine war. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=557.74s)]
*  They said they were going to end the war in in Gaza. Right. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=559.86s)]
*  They they said they were going to make government more efficient. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=563.26s)]
*  You know, they said they were going to lower interest rates. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=566.58s)]
*  They said they were going to lower home prices. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=568.82s)]
*  They said, you know, they said they said they said. Right. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=570.94s)]
*  But that's not what they've done. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=573.7800000000001s)]
*  Look at what they've done. None of those things has happened. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=574.94s)]
*  OK. They said they were going to weren't going to touch Medicaid. Right. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=578.1800000000001s)]
*  They they cut Medicaid benefits. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=581.0600000000001s)]
*  And so we got to watch what they do and stop being sold on what they say. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=583.4200000000001s)]
*  OK. And we're in the least productive Congress in 70 years. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=590.82s)]
*  They have all of government. How is that possible? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=595.1s)]
*  They have all of government and they're the least productive Congress in 70 years. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=598.0999999999999s)]
*  And so, look, it's unclear what will come out of the Senate. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=602.14s)]
*  You have all these different factions. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=604.42s)]
*  This Elon thing is complicating it, exposing the rifts. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=605.74s)]
*  This was why I was doing it in one bill was always, in my opinion, a strategic mistake. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=609.06s)]
*  Not that I'm giving them advice because it's just it's too big. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=613.54s)]
*  You know, and so, you know, let's see what happens. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=618.8199999999999s)]
*  Let's see what they come out with with the Senate. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=621.02s)]
*  They got to pass something. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=622.9s)]
*  I mean, if they don't pass a bill, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=624.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's an existential threat to their majority. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=626.9399999999999s)]
*  So they're going to have to pass something out of there. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=630.78s)]
*  But, yeah, look, not a good day on the stock market. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=634.6999999999999s)]
*  Right. You know, Elon said the tariffs are going to put us in a recession. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=637.26s)]
*  That's what all the economists have been saying. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=640.26s)]
*  And if you're a foreign country and you're watching this, I mean, we [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=643.78s)]
*  the US government has devolved into the into the housewives. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=647.62s)]
*  You know, China is looking at this. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=651.42s)]
*  India is looking at this. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=653.06s)]
*  Our European allies are looking at this. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=654.26s)]
*  Putin's looking at this. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=656.02s)]
*  You know, I mean, it just, you know, it's not not not a great look. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=657.5799999999999s)]
*  And you had Frederick Meyers, the chancellor of Germany at the White House. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=662.62s)]
*  Well, all of this was going on, trying to deliver an important message [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=666.38s)]
*  about supporting Ukraine. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=670.5s)]
*  And all Donald Trump wanted to do was talk about how he spoke to Putin [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=672.54s)]
*  and said that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was just like two kids who are fighting [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=677.1s)]
*  and that they need to continue to fight because that's what kids need to do. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=682.34s)]
*  And you have the chancellor. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=685.86s)]
*  And then Trump showed him what that was like in the afternoon. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=687.9s)]
*  Exactly. Before we go, anything else you want to say? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=691.18s)]
*  Yeah, you know, hydrate, everyone hydrate while you're scrolling. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=695.58s)]
*  Just hydrate, stay hydrated. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=699.22s)]
*  You know, we'll get through this. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=701.0600000000001s)]
*  I thrive in chaos with my emergency management background. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=702.0600000000001s)]
*  So like for me, I'm like I'm like ready to do like a logistic support mission over here. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=704.9s)]
*  But, you know, everyone everyone breathe. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=709.5s)]
*  Well, we'll we'll we'll get we'll get through it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=711.3s)]
*  Congressman Moskowitz, thanks for joining us. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShKwGjxC6v8&t=713.54s)]
