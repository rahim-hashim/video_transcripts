# Fox News COLLAPSES on AIR as Trump NEEDS MASSIVE HELP
**MeidasTouch:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20)
*  State regime media known as Fox is seeing Donald Trump's approval plummet. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=0.0s)]
*  Even Rasmussen has Donald Trump with a negative two approval. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=4.26s)]
*  That's down from plus eight last month in June. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=8.24s)]
*  All the other polls have Donald Trump in the 30s, maybe some very low 40s. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=10.96s)]
*  The worst start to a presidency, essentially ever even worse than his first term. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=15.76s)]
*  So state regime media hosts like Laura Ingraham are out there literally threatening senators. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=21.04s)]
*  You better do Donald Trump's agenda or else. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=27.44s)]
*  Here's what she posts in response to a right-wing mega extremist influencer named Eric Doughty [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=30.48s)]
*  who goes, at least four Republican senators threatened to derail Trump's Doge Cut rescission [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=36.36s)]
*  package that slashes NPR and PBS funds. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=42.0s)]
*  Lisa Murkowski, Mike Brown, Susan Collins, Dan Sullivan, Per Townhall. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  Why are you doing this? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=50.72s)]
*  State regime media host Laura Ingraham of Fox goes, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=52.0s)]
*  What vile propaganda trash she is, huh? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=65.84s)]
*  That's what you're going to do? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=69.28s)]
*  You're going to go and threaten them? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=70.28s)]
*  That's what you think your job is as a reporter? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=72.28s)]
*  How about you report the news, you loser? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  Everybody knows what a propagandist and a bad one that you are. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=78.2s)]
*  You may be making a lot of money, but you have sold your soul and it looks absolutely [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=82.72s)]
*  despicable like this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  Laura, when you bring on Lara, Laura and Lara, here you bring on Lara Trump and this is what [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=88.84s)]
*  you do with your show, seriously? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=94.2s)]
*  This is how you spend, this is how you're going to be remembered? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  You bring on Lara Trump, the guy's daughter-in-law, and she's like, this is the most transparent [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=99.42s)]
*  administration in history. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=104.36000000000001s)]
*  It's literally a freaking crime ring. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=105.88s)]
*  But play the clip. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=108.72s)]
*  Yeah, she must have gotten her hair cut a little too short there or something, Laura. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=109.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=112.36s)]
*  It's a new hairstyle for her too, I noticed. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=113.36s)]
*  This president, President Donald Trump, is the most transparent, as you just pointed [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=115.6s)]
*  out, president, I think in American history. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  He never stops, you know, to, he never misses an opportunity to stop and talk to the press, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  to engage with the press, to do multiple interactions and takes every question possible. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=127.44s)]
*  Okay, then you have Laura Ingraham saying that, you know, all of these people, these [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=133.04s)]
*  lazy liberals and all of these lazy people on Medicaid, there's all these lazy people [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=138.28s)]
*  in general, they loved COVID. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  You don't have to work, you don't have to go out. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=145.4s)]
*  For them, COVID was great. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=147.68s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=149.18s)]
*  Y'all were the biggest purveyors of disinformation about that, about the election. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=151.0s)]
*  Nobody was happy about it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=156.32s)]
*  What the hell are you talking about? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=157.74s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=159.32s)]
*  Happy during COVID. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=160.72s)]
*  I say this a lot. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=161.72s)]
*  They love COVID because you can sit at home, you can order DoorDash, the government sends [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=163.12s)]
*  you a check, no one goes to church, but you can go to the liquor store, you can order [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=167.56s)]
*  your pot online, right? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=171.84s)]
*  So the pot, they got pot, porn, no church, no work, and you know, DoorDash, and then [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=173.2s)]
*  watch Netflix, binge watch Netflix. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=178.64s)]
*  They love that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=180.48s)]
*  Looting for George Floyd was all part of the activity. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=181.48s)]
*  Right, because isn't that their talking point, that there are all of these people on Medicaid [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=183.76s)]
*  and all these people on Medicaid, they just, they don't want to work and they're getting [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=188.2s)]
*  rich off of Medicaid somehow. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=192.28s)]
*  These 35 year old men who live in their mother's basement, they're getting rich off of what? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=194.11999999999998s)]
*  Surgical reimbursements to their doctors. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=199.6s)]
*  What type of stupid talking points are these? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=201.92s)]
*  Most able-bodied people are working and most people who are not able-bodied need some form [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=204.88s)]
*  of healthcare like Medicaid or what else, and the able-bodied people will need healthcare [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=210.26s)]
*  as well and not all workplaces provide healthcare. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=214.2s)]
*  Then they bring on Will Cain right here. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=218.16s)]
*  Will Cain then says that former President Obama should be criminally prosecuted. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=220.56s)]
*  This is what they're talking about. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=225.2s)]
*  And the big obvious elephant in the room right here is Donald Trump's on the Epstein list [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=226.76s)]
*  and Donald Trump's covering up that he's covering up the Epstein list. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=231.92s)]
*  So they're like throwing everything out there right now because they know this MAGA thing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=235.96s)]
*  is a sinking ship. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=241.04s)]
*  Watch how desperate he is. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=242.84s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=244.4s)]
*  Let me revisit this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=245.44s)]
*  Back in 2020, a bipartisan Senate Intel Committee report did a deep dive into all of this and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=246.44s)]
*  found this quote. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  It's from secretary, then secretary, John Kerry, as in secretary of state John Kerry. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  And he told the committee that he submitted a written memo to President Obama advocating [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=258.44s)]
*  for a national bipartisan commission similar to the Warren Commission to dig deeply into [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=265.08s)]
*  every aspect of the Russian attempt to interfere with the 2016 election. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=270.24s)]
*  He stated he was disappointed. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=276.72s)]
*  Kerry was disappointed that the idea was not endorsed and move forward and that rather [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=278.32s)]
*  President Obama issued the tasking to the ICA, the intelligence community that ended [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=284.92s)]
*  up with what we saw here that incorporated the Steele dossier into the CIA and the FBI's [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  reports crossfire hurricane on President Trump. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  So here's the question. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=299.84s)]
*  Should we not be taking a closer look at President Obama and his role in the Russia collusion [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  hoax? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=306.4s)]
*  Oh, and then you bring on Lara Trump again. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=307.4s)]
*  Laura Ingraham and Lara Trump goes, we've got mem Donnie. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=311.0s)]
*  We got this guy mem Donnie. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  He's going to build communes in the luxury buildings. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=315.79999999999995s)]
*  You know, all of our Fox viewers who live in these luxury penthouses, you know, you [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=318.88s)]
*  know what I mean? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=324.2s)]
*  He's going to build communes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=325.2s)]
*  No, he just wants to make things more affordable. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=326.44s)]
*  Isn't that what Donald promised, but he lied about your play this clip. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=330.04s)]
*  But the only people left are the extremists. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=334.24s)]
*  As you just point out, we have mem Donnie who is going to be the Democrat representative [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=336.8s)]
*  there in New York and could become the mayor of New York City. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=340.76s)]
*  This is a guy who wants to defund police, who wants communes and luxury buildings and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=344.98s)]
*  is openly anti-Semitic. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=349.28s)]
*  You have the Jasmine Crockett's of the party and those are the stars. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=351.2s)]
*  But this is why we have to take the midterm seriously. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=354.88s)]
*  Laura, I want everyone to hear me loud and clear. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  We cannot allow people like this to become senators in the United States. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=361.24s)]
*  Look at the big, beautiful bill, right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=365.44s)]
*  That would not have been passed with one less GOP senator there. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=367.32s)]
*  And we need to make sure that we are coming out in these midterms with as much strength [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=371.32s)]
*  and as much energy as we did in 2024, because that's how important it is. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=375.24s)]
*  It is it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  We laugh at it and we think that this is funny because it quite frankly is ridiculous. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  But don't mistake it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=385.08s)]
*  The Democrats who are left in their party are so crazy and so radical at this point [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=386.38s)]
*  and we cannot take anything for granted. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=391.1s)]
*  I want everyone to make sure that they are already planning to get out to the polls in [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=393.02s)]
*  2026. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=396.26s)]
*  Yep. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=397.26s)]
*  Things are far less affordable right now. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=398.26s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=400.46s)]
*  Housing is less affordable. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=401.46s)]
*  Food is less affordable. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=402.46s)]
*  Go to the supermarket. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=403.46s)]
*  Go to a store. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=404.46s)]
*  You know things are more expensive. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=405.46s)]
*  You could keep saying a hundred times things are cheaper. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=406.65999999999997s)]
*  You've got rid of inflation. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=409.26s)]
*  It's not true. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=410.26s)]
*  We know. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=411.26s)]
*  And now Donald Trump's new tariffs against the world are going to cause more inflation [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=412.26s)]
*  like what the hell are you doing? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=416.26s)]
*  So like some deranged lunatics right here. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=417.7s)]
*  Here we have Fox just freaking out over the fact that Jasmine Crockett, a Democratic congresswoman [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=421.18s)]
*  from Texas, who you all know and love, that she's beating John Cornyn, the MAGA Republican [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=427.98s)]
*  senator from Texas in a head to head race. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=434.2s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=436.14s)]
*  A shocking poll shows Texas Democrat Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett is leading in the race for [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=437.14s)]
*  Even bigger news though, the massive backlash over her making the Texas flood disaster all [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=443.22s)]
*  about her. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=450.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, it's not news because she does that with everything. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=451.90000000000003s)]
*  Even talking about her hairstyle. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=455.98s)]
*  That's an odd mix of topics. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=458.14s)]
*  Of course, Fox needs to bring on Kristi Noem, the dog killing cosplayer who did not activate [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=459.96000000000004s)]
*  and rescue teams from FEMA within 72 hours. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=468.14s)]
*  When the storm took place, she waited what? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=472.90000000000003s)]
*  Like until Monday or Tuesday. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=474.74s)]
*  The storm hit Friday, but she had a lot of time to post images of herself on Instagram, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=477.34000000000003s)]
*  asking the audience, which photo should be my portrait? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=482.86s)]
*  Miss cowgirl or should it be Miss Blondie or should it be Miss Icy? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=486.82s)]
*  For real, you've seen me report on that. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=492.3s)]
*  We were the first Midas Touch Network. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=494.42s)]
*  We were the ones who showed what her Instagram posts were while people were dying and she [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=495.98s)]
*  was not activating search and rescue. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=501.14000000000004s)]
*  But OK, just say other media networks are fake news. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=503.06s)]
*  OK, OK, you're playing this clip. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=505.94s)]
*  CNN is basically you've got a report accusing you of slowing the process. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=507.74s)]
*  Would you like to respond to that? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=511.74s)]
*  Well, there you go. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=513.3000000000001s)]
*  Fake news. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=514.3000000000001s)]
*  CNN again is absolutely trash what they are doing by saying that because our Coast Guard, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=515.3000000000001s)]
*  our Border Patrol, BORTC teams were there immediately. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=520.02s)]
*  Every single thing I was on, they asked for, we were there. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=523.74s)]
*  The governor and the emergency management director, Nim Kidd, are fantastic. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=527.38s)]
*  And nobody there has said anything about that. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=532.5s)]
*  They didn't get everything that they wanted immediately or that they needed. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=536.26s)]
*  And I'm proud of the work that we've done to support that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=539.98s)]
*  But, you know, we've got flooding going on in New Mexico as well. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=542.26s)]
*  North Carolina. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=544.8199999999999s)]
*  So I've been visiting with their leadership team and spent quite a bit of time on the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=545.8199999999999s)]
*  phone yesterday with the New Mexico governor. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=549.66s)]
*  And I've been seeing them resources as well as well. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=552.2199999999999s)]
*  And that's what we do. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=555.2199999999999s)]
*  And, you know, the fact that CNN is continuing to be political and push out fake information [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=556.62s)]
*  and false information and lies is not shocking, but it's a disservice to the country. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=563.5799999999999s)]
*  It's a real disservice to the country because people start to mistrust anything that comes [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=569.78s)]
*  out then over the news. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=574.18s)]
*  Start. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=575.5799999999999s)]
*  And then, well, that's true. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=576.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=578.18s)]
*  But they they just don't trust anybody anymore. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=579.18s)]
*  Certainly we are. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=580.78s)]
*  And then you have Brooke Rollins over here. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=581.78s)]
*  And what does Brooke Rollins want to talk about? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=584.5799999999999s)]
*  Brooke Rollins wants to talk about all of these able-bodied people on Medicaid who are [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=586.78s)]
*  going to be working in the farms, right, at the same time that they've unleashed militarized [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=591.1s)]
*  ICE at the farms in California. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=596.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=599.5799999999999s)]
*  So all these able-bodied Medicaid people are going to be working on farms. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=600.5799999999999s)]
*  And then she says something about automation. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=603.66s)]
*  It's the biggest non-sequitur here. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=605.9s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=607.42s)]
*  H2A visa program. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=608.42s)]
*  I know they are working on that to work to effectuate the president's vision. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=609.5799999999999s)]
*  But at the end of the day, moving toward an American workforce based on automation, a [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=613.8199999999999s)]
*  lot of able-bodied adults in this country who are not working, we will get there. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=618.6999999999999s)]
*  But this president's heart is with the farmers. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=623.38s)]
*  It always has been. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=625.86s)]
*  And we will work nonstop until we find the right solution, but does not include amnesty [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=627.42s)]
*  and certainly moving toward the American workforce that he envisions. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=632.0999999999999s)]
*  And then you have Kristi Noem spreading lies about what the streets looked like under former [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=636.14s)]
*  President Biden. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=640.26s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=641.38s)]
*  First off, the environment for these ICE agents. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=642.38s)]
*  You know, we fear what may be coming next as we are not seeing the rhetoric tone down. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=644.8199999999999s)]
*  No, in fact, it's getting worse. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=649.42s)]
*  Some of these Democrat leaders in some of these communities and states are really, really [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=651.06s)]
*  elevating the emotion out there and lying and putting these officers' lives in jeopardy. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=656.54s)]
*  So I'm hopeful that people remember that they are just upholding the rule of law. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=662.58s)]
*  And remember what our streets were like under the last administration, how dangerous it [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=666.6600000000001s)]
*  was and that President Trump and these ICE officers are going after murderers and rapists, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=670.14s)]
*  people who are trafficking our children. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=675.46s)]
*  In fact, since President Trump has been in office, we've located over 10,000 of these [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=677.46s)]
*  missing children and been able to return them back to their family members and to their [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=681.7800000000001s)]
*  loved ones, arrested over 400 different sponsors that were out there perpetuating this kind [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=686.6600000000001s)]
*  of activity. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=692.38s)]
*  So these ICE officers are patriots and they're going out every day and making our streets [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=693.38s)]
*  safer. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=697.58s)]
*  And then the acting ICE director Todd Lyons swings and misses at this question when he [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=698.58s)]
*  was asked by Fox. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=703.46s)]
*  So how will people know if it's ICE or they're actually getting kidnapped from a masked intruder? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=704.5s)]
*  Isn't this also dangerous for ICE? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=712.38s)]
*  Watch what Todd Lyons has to say. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=714.38s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=716.18s)]
*  Something that Karen Bass, the mayor of LA just said caught my attention when she said, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=717.18s)]
*  How do we know that this is an arrest and not a kidnapping? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=720.54s)]
*  I'll turn it over to you. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=724.86s)]
*  How would you know? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=725.86s)]
*  Well, I mean, Dana, you can see from all the video too, right? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=726.86s)]
*  They say that ICE agents, they're not properly marked. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=731.2199999999999s)]
*  You see them in their tactical gear, in their vest, where you see blaming FBI, ATF, ICE, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=734.9399999999999s)]
*  HSI, ERO, whoever is out with us. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=741.38s)]
*  So the mayor's claims are just totally false. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=744.02s)]
*  And what she's doing is making people afraid of us. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=746.3399999999999s)]
*  If LA wasn't a sanctuary city, we wouldn't have to go on the streets. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=749.5400000000001s)]
*  If they turn these criminals over to us in a secure setting, we would not be out there. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=753.1800000000001s)]
*  So what the mayor is doing is she's stoking the flames of this and she's the one that's [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=757.76s)]
*  making it worse than what it really is. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=761.86s)]
*  And then finally, this MAGA Republican Senator, Senator Pete Ricketts is asked about the United [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=763.52s)]
*  States cutting off funding to people with AIDS in Africa or pregnant women to prevent [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=770.58s)]
*  their kids from getting AIDS in Africa. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=777.76s)]
*  And then, you know, I can't even think about what the number is of how many people the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=780.6s)]
*  American government has killed in Africa and abroad by cutting off aid and cutting off [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=784.38s)]
*  life-saving AIDS-related drugs and HIV drugs. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=789.74s)]
*  And here's his response here, play this clip. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=793.24s)]
*  You're not necessarily one of those who's arguing for this, but what are your colleagues [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=795.24s)]
*  saying about how they want the rescission package changed? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=798.96s)]
*  Look, we're the U.S. Senate. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=801.76s)]
*  We took the one big, beautiful bill. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=804.92s)]
*  Bill and I told you, by the way, we'd get that negotiation done, but we took the House [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=806.8399999999999s)]
*  bill and we made that better. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=810.04s)]
*  And then the House passed this. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=812.4399999999999s)]
*  Now we're going to pick up getting spending under control, which is something we need [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=813.88s)]
*  to do to get the budget aligned. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=816.9599999999999s)]
*  And this rescission package is a great first step. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=818.9599999999999s)]
*  But again, we're going to want to have the opportunity to review it, maybe have the opportunity [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=821.52s)]
*  to make it better. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=825.8399999999999s)]
*  Some of my colleagues, for example, are concerned about some of the programs like PEPFAR. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=826.8399999999999s)]
*  This was a program George Bush started to combat AIDS in Africa. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=831.12s)]
*  We certainly want to take out the woke stuff that the past administration was doing with [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=834.76s)]
*  that, but it also serves a very good purpose. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=839.8s)]
*  So we just want to make sure that as we're getting this stuff right-sized and we're cutting [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=842.08s)]
*  away the fat of the things that were not being productive, we keep the stuff that is good. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=845.84s)]
*  That's really, I think, the goal of my colleagues when they're saying, hey, we want to have [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=850.72s)]
*  a chance to take a look at this rescission package. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=853.52s)]
*  And let me just show you conversely what Democrats are talking about. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=855.72s)]
*  Here's Democratic Senator from New Jersey, Senator Kim. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=859.48s)]
*  Here's what he says on MSNBC. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=862.74s)]
*  I've got to say, I've covered a lot of natural disasters through the years, Superstorm Sandy [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=864.62s)]
*  being one and hurricanes and droughts and things like that. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=870.42s)]
*  It is a little weird that the acting administrator from FEMA has no experience in emergency management, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=875.1800000000001s)]
*  doesn't seem to know that there's a hurricane season. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=881.5s)]
*  Maybe he was joking, maybe not. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=883.98s)]
*  And has said bupkis while they're gutting the agency in the aftermath of this and as [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=885.46s)]
*  we prepare for hurricane season. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=890.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=892.58s)]
*  And also, where is he right now? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=893.58s)]
*  Has anyone actually seen him since this disaster in Texas? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=896.86s)]
*  We have a completely absent FEMA acting administrator and he was not joking that he didn't know [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=900.74s)]
*  when hurricane season was. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=907.3s)]
*  And actually, when I was doing a nomination hearing of another senior leader of DHS, I [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=908.78s)]
*  asked them when is hurricane season. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=914.82s)]
*  They didn't know what timetable was. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=916.82s)]
*  And look, as we're getting into it, I mean, NOAA, our own National Weather Service is [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=919.34s)]
*  saying that we could expect upwards of 19 named tropical storms, including upwards of [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=923.82s)]
*  five category three, four and five hurricanes. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=928.74s)]
*  This is something that's not theoretical in terms of the worry that my state of New Jersey [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=932.7s)]
*  and up and down the coast is facing. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=936.3000000000001s)]
*  And when we see this kind of incompetence with the response to what's happening in Texas [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=938.94s)]
*  and the horrible tragedy there, it leaves a lot of people in my state and around this [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=943.62s)]
*  country very nervous about what's to come. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=947.62s)]
*  There you have it, folks. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=950.06s)]
*  Let me know what you think. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUVaYihup20&t=951.06s)]
