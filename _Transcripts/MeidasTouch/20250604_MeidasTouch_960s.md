# YIKES! MAGA Mike gets TORN TO SHREDS by his OWN PARTY
**MeidasTouch:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4)
*  No, MAGA Mike, it's all falling apart. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=0.0s)]
*  No, MAGA Mike, the Republican Speaker of the House is getting betrayed, not just by Elon [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=4.28s)]
*  Musk, but from others in his own party. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=11.68s)]
*  Even MAGA Republican Congress members who voted for the disastrous budget bill, now that [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=14.84s)]
*  Elon Musk is saying he's against it, you've got these MAGA Republican Congress members [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=20.2s)]
*  saying that they're against it too. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=25.2s)]
*  I said, no, MAGA Mike Johnson. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=27.599999999999998s)]
*  Take a look at MAGA Republican Congress member Scott Perry, who voted for the disastrous [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=30.68s)]
*  budget bill, now coming out against it after Elon Musk posts, I'm sorry, but I just can't [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=37.04s)]
*  stand it anymore. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=44.2s)]
*  This massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=45.72s)]
*  MAGA Republican Congress member Scott Perry goes, so at Elon Musk is right to call out [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=53.56s)]
*  the House leadership. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=59.36s)]
*  I wish I had a nickel for every time the Freedom Caucus sounded the alarm and nobody listened, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=60.72s)]
*  only to find out the hard way, we were right all along. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=67.76s)]
*  We expect massive improvements from the Senate before it gets back to the House. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  Dude, you voted for this. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=78.72s)]
*  Why wouldn't you make the improvements? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  You're from the Freedom Caucus. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=83.36s)]
*  Why the Freedom Caucus? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=84.96s)]
*  Vote for this to give it back to the Senate to then make the cuts that you're supposed [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=86.72s)]
*  to make. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=91.56s)]
*  What in the world is going on? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=92.56s)]
*  You voted for this, as we said. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=94.12s)]
*  Is this you? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=96.52s)]
*  You voted for it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=97.52s)]
*  Then you have MAGA Republican Senator Rand Paul, who's always come out against this disastrous [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=98.52s)]
*  bill. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=104.88s)]
*  He goes, I agree with Elon. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=105.88s)]
*  seen the massive wasted government spending and we know another $5 trillion in debt is [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=108.76s)]
*  a huge mistake. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=116.0s)]
*  Then you have Rand Paul say some of us are trying to stop Congress making America bankrupt [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  in response to what Elon Musk said. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=126.4s)]
*  Then you have MAGA Republican Senator Mike Lee, who calls himself at-based Mike Lee. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=128.68s)]
*  The dude calls himself based. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=135.2s)]
*  I don't really know what based fully means, but I would imagine the least based thing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=137.88s)]
*  is calling yourself based. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  So in response to Elon Musk coming out against this, Mike Lee goes, federal spending has [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=144.48s)]
*  become excessive. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=149.64s)]
*  The resulting inflation harms Americans and weaponizes government. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=151.32s)]
*  The Senate can make this bill better. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=156.33999999999997s)]
*  It must now do so. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=159.01999999999998s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  No, MAGA Mike. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=162.67999999999998s)]
*  It's Marjorie Taylor Greene, too. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=164.16s)]
*  No. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=166.16s)]
*  Anyway, that's like I saw that on TikTok where they go, no, make it annoying so I'll stop [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=167.16s)]
*  doing it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  But anyway, MAGA Republican Congress member Marjorie Taylor Greene goes, full transparency. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  I did not know about this section on pages 278 and 279 of the budget bill that strips [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=179.68s)]
*  the states of their right to make laws or regulate AI for 10 years. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=187.12s)]
*  I am adamantly opposed to this and it is a violation of states' rights and I would [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=192.56s)]
*  have voted no if I had known this was in there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=198.68s)]
*  We have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next 10 years and giving it free rein [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=202.6s)]
*  and tying states' hands is potentially dangerous. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=207.4s)]
*  This needs to be stripped out in the Senate. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=210.6s)]
*  When the budget comes back to the House for approval after the Senate changes, I will [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=213.12s)]
*  not vote for it with this in it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  Our editor in chief, Ron Filipkowski, goes, apparently Marge, and I guess Scott Perry [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=220.14s)]
*  also, didn't read the bill before they voted on it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=224.82s)]
*  And just to remind you what Elon Musk was saying all day yesterday, he goes, I'm sorry, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  but I just can't stand it anymore. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=233.54s)]
*  This massive, outrageous, pork-field congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=235.5s)]
*  Shame on those who voted for it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=241.77999999999997s)]
*  You know you did wrong. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=243.7s)]
*  You know it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=245.22s)]
*  It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion in burdened [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=246.22s)]
*  American citizens with crushingly unsustainable math or unsustainable debt, to which mega-Republican [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=252.9s)]
*  Thomas Massey said, he's right. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=260.78s)]
*  Elon Musk is right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=262.78s)]
*  To which Elon Musk says, simple math, man, simple math. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=264.5s)]
*  And then Elon Musk says, fire these Republicans. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=268.38s)]
*  Get rid of these Republicans. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=271.42s)]
*  He goes, in November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=272.82s)]
*  And it was in response to this guy, Matt Van Swal, saying, okay, let me get this straight. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=280.42s)]
*  Here's what the GOP is doing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=285.74s)]
*  And Musk is saying, fire the GOP. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=287.62s)]
*  Get rid of them. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=290.78s)]
*  And then Elon Musk reposts this account, SMX. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=291.88s)]
*  The truth sets a man free. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=295.68s)]
*  And Elon Musk has fearlessly spoken about it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=298.04s)]
*  Or, yeah, fearlessly spoken about it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=302.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=304.32s)]
*  So now let me show you Maga Mike. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=305.32s)]
*  Should I show you Botox Maga Mike first or non-Botox Maga Mike first? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  Let me show you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=312.44s)]
*  About a few weeks ago, this is actually late March 2025, Botox Maga Mike was on the Mike [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=313.44s)]
*  Levin show. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=321.52s)]
*  Mike Levin talks like that on Fox. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=322.52s)]
*  That's how, that's my impression of Mike Levin. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=324.84s)]
*  And Botox Maga Mike Johnson, look at this guy's face here. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=327.24s)]
*  It's crazy looking. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=331.44s)]
*  Maga Mike Johnson says, you know, should I do it with the, you know, Elon Musk has really [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=332.44s)]
*  figured this all out. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=338.24s)]
*  His algorithm has made our budget bill perfect. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=340.8s)]
*  You know, he's so good, Elon. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=343.44s)]
*  Watch Botox Maga Mike. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=345.62s)]
*  He prays and glazed Elon only for Elon to say, F you, Maga Mike, play this clip. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=347.28s)]
*  We wanted to pass a resolution that would effectively freeze spending so that the administration [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=354.28s)]
*  can continue its incredible work through Doge and through the other efforts of the administration [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=359.2s)]
*  to go in and root out the fraud, waste and abuse that we've been trying to target in [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=364.08s)]
*  Congress for decades. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=368.2s)]
*  But we haven't been able to get to it because we didn't have the algorithms that Elon has. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=369.76s)]
*  We didn't have the access to all the data and the funding. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=374.4s)]
*  And so now the game has changed. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=377.44s)]
*  So we needed to hold the line and what we're doing right now so that when we get to the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=378.82s)]
*  next fiscal year, FY26, which we will begin work on immediately now that this is done, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=383.92s)]
*  we'll be able to incorporate all those savings and all the new transformational kinds of [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=388.92s)]
*  policies the administration is working with us to bring about. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=393.20000000000005s)]
*  So this bill effectively does freeze funding, except that what you said, it adds a little [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=396.44s)]
*  to defense. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  That's what Pete Hegseth said he needed the Department of Defense some flexibility and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  $6 billion additional dollars for the immediate needs. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=405.92s)]
*  It reduces non-defense discretionary spending by 13, about $13 billion. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  So overall, a $7 billion savings to the American people. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=414.68s)]
*  And Mark, we are just getting started. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=418.0s)]
*  That was Botox Maga Mike right there. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=419.92s)]
*  Let me show you non-Botox Maga Mike Johnson here. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=422.28000000000003s)]
*  This is Maga Mike Johnson. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=426.72s)]
*  Let's play this clip right here. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=428.92s)]
*  A Maga Mike Johnson crediting Elon's magical algorithms and the Doge cuts for helping make [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=430.32000000000005s)]
*  this budget great that Elon now says he hates. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=437.94s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=441.26s)]
*  And the beauty of what Doge has been able to do, the reason it's so revolutionary is [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=442.26s)]
*  because Elon cracked the code. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  He had access, all the stars aligned. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=448.2s)]
*  We had a president and was bold enough to do it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=449.79999999999995s)]
*  We had somebody with Elon's talent and capability to come in and have his magic algorithms running [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=451.9s)]
*  through the data to find all these irregularities. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=456.88s)]

*  Like I say, the multi-step process, we'd already have the border funding, we'd have defense, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=721.1s)]
*  we'd have $850 billion of real savings banked already. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=726.18s)]
*  Plus, we could have had extended current tax law, taken tax law, increase off the table. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=729.74s)]
*  We could have had all that done, but unfortunately, the decisions were made to do one big, beautiful [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=733.98s)]
*  bill. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=738.9s)]

*  I'm sorry. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=740.9s)]
*  It's not a big, beautiful bill. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=741.9s)]
*  That's called rhetoric. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=742.9s)]
*  There's one thing that here we've got Maga Republican Rand Paul. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=743.9s)]
*  Saying my objection's not about the tax cuts. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=749.46s)]
*  It's that this is going to add $5 trillion to the deficit. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=752.14s)]
*  You play this clip right here. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=756.82s)]
*  I want to get you to address the two things we just heard from OMB director Russ Vogt and [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=758.1800000000001s)]
*  one made by the president. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=762.86s)]
*  First of all, they argue the big, beautiful bill puts in place growth measures that you're [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=764.38s)]
*  not accounting for. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=768.98s)]
*  I've been around this game for a while. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=770.58s)]
*  You have as well. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=772.76s)]
*  I do know that growth is something that every administration counts on to offset their spending. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=773.76s)]
*  But do you not think the president has a point with deregulation and tax cuts that we could [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=779.7399999999999s)]
*  see real growth that actually helps not jack up the deficit as is accounted for? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=783.66s)]
*  I actually do. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=789.54s)]
*  This is where I think the president and I are talking past each other. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=791.42s)]
*  I accept the growth arguments. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=794.5s)]
*  I actually accept that cutting taxes can grow revenue. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=796.3s)]
*  I believe it happened under Reagan. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=799.3s)]
*  I believe it happened under the first Trump term. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=800.8599999999999s)]
*  I supported the tax cuts in the first term. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=802.9799999999999s)]
*  I still support them. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=805.6999999999999s)]
*  I support making them permanent. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=806.7s)]
*  And I do believe they will bring in more revenue than the CBO projects. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=808.5s)]
*  My objection to the bill isn't about the tax cuts and it isn't about those calculations. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=813.0200000000001s)]
*  My objection to the bill is they're going to raise the debt ceiling more than they ever [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=818.1s)]
*  have five trillion dollars and that this will be the largest increase in the debt ceiling [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=822.86s)]
*  ever. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=829.1400000000001s)]
*  And if the Republicans all vote for it, the Republicans will own the debt. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=830.1400000000001s)]
*  They will lose their high moral ground. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=833.48s)]
*  We will no longer be the party that can say, look at the Democrats. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=835.78s)]
*  They're the ones, you know, voicing the debt on our country. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=838.86s)]
*  We're drowning to see a debt caused by Democrats, which has largely been true. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=842.06s)]
*  But I think now they vote for this. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=846.54s)]
*  So if they separate out the debt ceiling, I could be for the bill. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=848.1s)]
*  And then you have the Senate majority leader, John Thune, MAGA Republican John Thune. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=851.5s)]
*  He's like, I hope Elon comes to to a different conclusion here. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=857.66s)]
*  I hope Elon figures this all out and he likes us again. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=862.18s)]
*  Maybe Elon wants to be our friend again. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=866.3399999999999s)]
*  We like Elon as friend. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=868.64s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=870.2199999999999s)]
*  Are you concerned that he could help tank this bill and whip members against it? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=871.2199999999999s)]
*  Well, my hope is that as he has an opportunity to further assess what this bill actually [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=875.8199999999999s)]
*  does, that he'll come to a different conclusion. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=883.0999999999999s)]
*  But nevertheless, I mean, we have a job to do. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=884.9399999999999s)]
*  The American people elect us to do. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=887.54s)]
*  We have an agenda that everybody campaigned on, most notably the president of the United [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=888.9s)]
*  States, and we're going to deliver on that agenda. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=893.42s)]
*  And the legislation as passed by the House can be approved here in the Senate, can be [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=896.1s)]
*  strengthened in the Senate in a number of ways. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=899.4599999999999s)]
*  We intend to do that. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vwDwqZoS4&t=901.6s)]
