# SECRET Video EXPOSES Trump DOJ COVER UP for his PAST
**MeidasTouch:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k)
*  Wow, so undercover video of Donald Trump's Attorney General, Pam Bondi, has just been released and it shows that Bondi, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=0.0s)]
*  likely on behalf of Donald Trump, is trying to cover up the release of the Epstein files. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=9.6s)]
*  It's what we've been saying now over and over again, but a right-wing reporter named James O'Keefe [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=16.0s)]
*  was the one who launched this undercover sting operation against the right-wing Attorney General, Pam Bondi, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=23.8s)]
*  believing that Bondi was involved in this cover-up of the Epstein files for weeks and months, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=32.400000000000006s)]
*  and with respect to Trump, for years, he said he was going to release it. He said he was going to release it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=38.800000000000004s)]
*  He blamed everybody else for being with Epstein, but we know it's always projection and confession with Trump and MAGA [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=44.2s)]
*  because Donald Trump was, of course, very close with Epstein. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=50.8s)]
*  So I want to share with you what James O'Keefe released. Again, he is a right-wing reporter, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=54.4s)]
*  and he's the one who launched this undercover sting operation against Bondi [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  because he's pissed that he feels that he and other right-wing influencers have been lied to by Bondi. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=65.8s)]
*  So they sent somebody in when Bondi was basically out at lunch a few days ago, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=72.4s)]
*  and the person said that they were a nanny, just like a random stranger, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=79.2s)]
*  shows up, kind of sits down next to Attorney General Bondi and starts asking questions about the Epstein files. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=83.8s)]
*  Now, Bondi says things to this nanny that she's never even told the public to a random stranger. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  Bondi says the reason that it's being delayed is because there's 10,000 videos of Epstein with children. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=98.0s)]
*  Now, why wouldn't you tell that to the public? Watch what happens in this undercover video. Let's play it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=106.0s)]
*  Do you know when the Epstein files are going to be released? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=112.2s)]
*  We hope soon. I don't realize then. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=114.4s)]
*  Okay. Any dates? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  No, you know what it is? There are 10,000 videos. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=119.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=124.8s)]
*  And it's all with little kids, so they have to go through every one. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=125.2s)]
*  So, look, James O'Keefe got that video, and he said that he was going to release the video. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=129.4s)]
*  So he had a series of questions that he posed to Attorney General Pam Bondi and said, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=136.2s)]
*  why were you just telling a random stranger about those acts by Epstein and not the public? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=142.6s)]
*  You've never cited that before as the reason for delay. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=150.0s)]
*  Don't you think you should tell the American people that over some random stranger who says that they're a nanny at some place that you're eating lunch? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  What's your response? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=163.0s)]
*  So then Pam Bondi gives a press conference and she tries to get in front of the undercover recording by bringing out this information in public [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=164.4s)]
*  to try to preempt the release by James O'Keefe, the right-wing reporter, on what he uncovered through these secret recordings of Bondi. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=176.0s)]
*  So here's what she then says to the public. Let's play it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  The FBI, they're reviewing, there are tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children or child porn. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=189.0s)]
*  And there are hundreds of victims and no one victim will ever get released. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=199.0s)]
*  It's just the volume and that's what they're going through right now. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=204.8s)]
*  The FBI is diligently going through that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=207.6s)]
*  I haven't seen that statement, but I'll call them later and find out. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=210.4s)]
*  So then this caused an entire stir in the right-wing kind of media far, far right MAGA ecosystem. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=213.6s)]
*  Now, I would never normally play you a clip of Alex Jones. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=222.6s)]
*  I'm going to play a very short clip, don't you worry, because I want to show you now that all of these MAGA influencers are now saying [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=226.2s)]
*  Bondi is covering up the Epstein files and is she covering it up for Trump? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=234.0s)]
*  They're getting very close to what's really going on here. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=239.2s)]
*  Here's what Jones said. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=242.4s)]
*  He goes Bondi is covering up the Epstein files. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=243.6s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  Our reports and this is supposedly the first truncheon that's coming out today that James O. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=247.6s)]
*  Keefe's one of the two big stories he's breaking is about someone in the Trump administration covering up Epstein. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  And then he put out a little short trailer yesterday that shows an image of still shot of video of Pam Bondi, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=265.8s)]
*  but he wouldn't even say who in the administration. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=275.0s)]
*  I made some phone calls and I told the crew over the weekend. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=277.8s)]
*  I said, it's Pam Bondi. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=283.4s)]
*  I'm. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=286.4s)]
*  According to my sources and. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=289.4s)]
*  Because. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=292.4s)]
*  The White House already knows about this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=294.4s)]
*  Now I want to remind you all that this was just two months ago when Bondi said the files were on her desk. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=296.2s)]
*  She said they were going to be released. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  Remember when she said that we've got the receipts for that as well. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=307.2s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=310.4s)]
*  The DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=311.4s)]
*  Will that really happen? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=315.79999999999995s)]
*  It's sitting on my desk right now to review. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=317.4s)]
*  That's been a directive by President Trump. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=320.4s)]
*  I'm reviewing that I'm reviewing JFK files MLK files. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=322.79999999999995s)]
*  That's all in the process of being reviewed because that was done at the directive of the president. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=326.79999999999995s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=331.2s)]
*  I was briefed on that yesterday. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  I can't talk about that publicly, but you know, President Trump is given a very strong directive and that's going to be followed. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=334.79999999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=341.2s)]
*  OK, so a lot of documents. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=341.8s)]
*  Yeah, OK. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=343.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  So people can expect actual movement on this. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=345.0s)]
*  It's not just empty promises. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=346.8s)]
*  Oh, Donald Trump doesn't make empty promise. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=348.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=350.59999999999997s)]
*  I think I think promises made promises kept. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=351.0s)]
*  Now she was forced to say that after she brought in all of those MAGA influencers to the White House a few months back. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=354.2s)]
*  And she handed them a binder that said the full Epstein list the full Epstein files. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=364.59999999999997s)]
*  And it wasn't MAGA influencers made a mockery of these serious crimes with real victims helping the government hide the Epstein files. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=370.4s)]
*  So many Americans demanded they tried to gaslight even their own followers and they got exposed because it wasn't the Epstein files. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  It was Jeffrey Epstein's call list that was released in like 2018 and 2019. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  That was already public. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  By the way, Donald Trump was spotted in Jeffrey Epstein's personal address book call list with a full list of contacts. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=398.2s)]
*  We have it right there because Trump was one of Epstein's closest friends. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=406.9s)]
*  But all the other files have not yet been released. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=412.0s)]
*  Now, do you remember when Donald Trump went on Fox during the campaign and he was asked, so you said you're going to release it? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=415.9s)]
*  Are you going to release it? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=424.0s)]
*  And remember Donald Trump's response how weird it was. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=425.5s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I'll release the JFK. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=428.4s)]
*  I'm not sure so much so about the Epstein. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  He's like some of the stuff in that world. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't know if it's true or something like that here. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  Watch what he says here. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=437.79999999999995s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=439.0s)]
*  Would you declassify the 9-11 files? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=439.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=442.4s)]
*  Would you declassify JFK files? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=444.9s)]
*  I did a lot of it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=446.2s)]
*  Would you declassify the Epstein files? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=447.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I would. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=449.9s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=451.5s)]
*  I guess I would. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=451.79999999999995s)]
*  I think that less so because you know, you don't know. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=452.8s)]
*  You don't want to affect people's lives if it's phony stuff in there because there's a lot of phony stuff with that whole world. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=455.8s)]
*  But I think I would. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=462.5s)]
*  And folks, a lot of unusual things, sad things rather, you know, have been happening recently as well. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=463.5s)]
*  Virginia Joufray, one of Epstein's most high profile victims who is living in Australia. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=470.6s)]
*  She died by suicide in the past two weeks. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=478.0s)]
*  Tragic, tragic situation. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=482.09999999999997s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene posts, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=485.0s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Joufray died by suicide. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=487.0s)]
*  The truth needs to come out more no matter who is responsible. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=491.4s)]
*  You have people like Nancy Mace out there saying, you know, we want to know more about Epstein. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=497.5s)]
*  I mean, obviously, you know that this is coming from Donald Trump. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=505.1s)]
*  But listen to it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=508.3s)]
*  Maggie Republican Nancy Mace has played this clip right before our eyes. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=509.1s)]
*  And they are doing this in real time with regards to the Epstein list, which the government still has not released today. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=513.9s)]
*  And the American people deserve to know who rich and powerful is on that list and who the government is covering up for. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=522.1s)]
*  So you ever try to sleep with one mosquito in the room that high pitched buzzing near your ear, the frantic lights on, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=531.6s)]
*  lights off routine, trying to find it only to wake up the next morning covered in bites. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=537.2s)]
*  That used to be me every summer night in my house until I reached my breaking point. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=541.6s)]

*  Thank you, Bzigo, for sponsoring this episode. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=607.0s)]
*  May I posit something? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=610.0s)]
*  May I give you my hypothesis? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=613.0s)]
*  My opinion? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=615.0s)]
*  Me things. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=616.0s)]
*  I think that Donald Trump is telling Pam Bondi to slow roll and deep six the entire Epstein thing. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=618.0s)]
*  Look, folks, I've done a lot of videos on this, so I won't recap all of the things that I've done deep dives into this. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=626.0s)]
*  But just look at Ghislaine Maxwell's trial. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=633.0s)]
*  She was the sex trafficker for Epstein. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=636.0s)]
*  She's in jail for the rest of her life. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=638.0s)]
*  Donald Trump wished her well when she was going to trial, when Trump was asked, I wish her well, he said. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=641.0s)]
*  Also at the trial, testifying at Maxwell's trial in New York City, a woman identified by the pseudonym Jane Doe said she met Donald Trump in the 1990s at his Mar-a-Lago resort when Epstein introduced her to Donald Trump at the age of 14. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=648.0s)]
*  Release that. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=669.0s)]
*  Make that public. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=670.0s)]
*  That's she's using a pseudonym. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=672.0s)]
*  There's grand jury testimony. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=674.0s)]
*  I want to know what went down there. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=676.0s)]
*  Why do you think Donald Trump doesn't want this stuff released? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=678.0s)]
*  We know from the other cases where things have been released, Donald Trump is on Epstein's flight logs at least seven times. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=681.0s)]
*  That's only a partial flight log. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=689.0s)]
*  There's way more flight logs out there. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=691.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's all over the deposition transcripts of Epstein's sex trafficking victims. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=695.0s)]
*  Epstein was on Donald Trump's flight. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=702.0s)]
*  Trump said that Epstein's a great guy who likes girls on the younger side or women on the younger side. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=705.0s)]
*  Let's show you right here. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=711.0s)]
*  This is a compilation that shows you just a small glimpse into the Trump-Epstein connection. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=714.0s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=719.0s)]
*  I'm going to get great ratings on your show. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=720.0s)]
*  Trump is surrounded by women as music flares in the background. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=722.0s)]
*  After a while, Trump goes to greet three new guests, among them the financier Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=726.0s)]
*  Come on in. Go inside. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=733.0s)]
*  More than a decade before his guilty plea on state prostitution charges. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=735.0s)]
*  Later in the footage, Trump is seen talking to Epstein and another man as women are dancing in front of them. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=739.0s)]
*  Trump alternates between dancing and pointing out women to Epstein and the other men and telling Epstein about the cameras. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=746.0s)]
*  Though exactly what they say is difficult to understand as they discuss the women and their appearances, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=755.0s)]
*  Trump gestures to one and appears to say to Epstein, look at her back there. She's hot. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=761.0s)]
*  And then Trump says something else into Epstein's ear that makes him double over with laughter. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=769.0s)]
*  But as the president says now, he never liked Epstein. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=777.0s)]
*  Now, you know we do our own independent research here at the Midas Touch Network. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=781.0s)]
*  So I had Michael Wolff who spoke with Jeffrey Epstein when Epstein was alive, before Epstein died by suicide, as it's alleged. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=785.0s)]
*  And Michael Wolff said that he's got hours and hours of tapes with Epstein. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=795.0s)]
*  And Epstein said that they were, he was like Trump's closest friend, like they're as close as can be. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=800.0s)]
*  And Trump said Epstein likes young women. I mean, which I think he means girls. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=806.0s)]
*  Virginia Joufray, who died by suicide, worked at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=813.0s)]
*  Epstein would find the girls at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=817.0s)]
*  And he found her at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=821.0s)]
*  Ghislaine Maxwell would show up at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=823.0s)]
*  Ghislaine Maxwell, Virginia Joufray was homeless. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=825.0s)]
*  She got a job at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=829.0s)]
*  Ghislaine, in the 90s, went there, brought her back to Epstein. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=831.0s)]
*  And that's how Epstein found her, at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=835.0s)]
*  OK, here's what Michael Wolff tells me. Let's play it. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=839.0s)]
*  He sat for many, many hours of discussion with with me. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=842.0s)]
*  I mean, certainly, certainly 80, 90, probably 100 hours I have of Epstein on tape. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=848.0s)]
*  And one of the discussions, because this was occurring, Trump became the president in 2017. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=856.0s)]
*  I began writing about Trump. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=866.0s)]
*  And so we spent a lot of time talking about Donald Trump and Epstein's relationship with Trump, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=870.0s)]
*  which was went on for a good certainly 15 years and was incredibly close. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=877.0s)]
*  They were each other's closest friend for a very long time. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=883.0s)]
*  And Epstein, you know, I think Epstein is one of those people who truly knew Donald Trump, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=890.0s)]
*  knew many secrets about Donald Trump and was threatening to Donald. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=898.0s)]
*  So let's use some critical thinking here. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=905.0s)]
*  So now two things have either happened. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=909.0s)]
*  Either one, Pam Bondi has been covering up from the public that there exist tens of thousands, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=913.0s)]
*  tens of thousands of Epstein tapes. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=922.0s)]
*  Or Bondi is saying that in order to cause further delay, which would be disgusting and vile or both. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=928.0s)]
*  You tell me. But, you know, it's strange for me to have to say this in a video. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=938.0s)]
*  But James O'Keefe got a good video right there, I think. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=946.0s)]
*  This stuff should be released to the public. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=951.0s)]
*  Absolutely 100 percent. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2YomgDEl1k&t=954.0s)]
