# FURIOUS Arizona Voters UNLEASH HELL at Trump
**MeidasTouch:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0)
*  Arizona voters seem to be turning against Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=0.0s)]
*  They are expressing, I would say to put it mildly, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=4.7s)]
*  deep reservations, even if they've supported him in the past. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=8.36s)]
*  And those who are just not even all that political [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=12.24s)]
*  are just saying, what the heck is this guy doing? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=14.96s)]
*  Whether it's his tariffs, his attacking of Medicaid, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=18.04s)]
*  whether it's his immigration policy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=22.26s)]
*  I wanna show you what people are thinking [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=24.7s)]
*  in Arizona right now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=26.5s)]
*  So first I'm gonna show you a lady [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=27.64s)]
*  who was a Trump supporter. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=29.82s)]
*  She considers herself a devout Christian. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=32.46s)]
*  She runs a business that hires people with disabilities. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=35.92s)]
*  She's worried about Trump cutting Medicaid [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=39.42s)]
*  and the MAGA Republicans cutting Medicaid. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=41.66s)]
*  She says she's more open to voting for Democrats now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=43.66s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=46.46s)]
*  I'm worried about Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  He did say that he wasn't going to cut them, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=50.58s)]
*  that he was just going to find the waste. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=53.66s)]
*  And I really hope that he sticks to that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=56.22s)]
*  Why is that so important to you? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=58.62s)]
*  It's important because we need to take care [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=60.14s)]
*  of our people with disabilities and our elderly [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  and those that depend on it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=64.74s)]
*  And they can't survive as it is right now [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=66.17999999999999s)]
*  and we cannot cut. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=68.88s)]
*  Marga is a Tucson hero. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=72.32s)]
*  Her food truck and candy store employ 50 people [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=74.28s)]
*  with special needs. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=76.94s)]
*  She's renovating this restaurant to employ even more. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=78.22s)]
*  A devout Christian, lifelong Republican, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=81.88s)]
*  but some big changes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=84.32s)]
*  Marga says she no longer believes [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=85.78s)]
*  Trump's claim to the 2020 election was rigged. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=87.38s)]
*  She's now open to supporting Democrats for local offices [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=90.0s)]
*  and says Trump tariffs are one reason [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=93.44s)]
*  prices are not dropping fast enough. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=96.14s)]
*  The items that we put in our gift baskets have gone up. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=98.6s)]
*  So when he says there's going to be some disruption, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=101.78s)]
*  maybe even some pain, but we're going to get there, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=104.69999999999999s)]
*  for now you think, okay, I'll give you some time. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=107.97999999999999s)]
*  I'll give him some time and I'm hopeful, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=110.38s)]
*  but I think that if he doesn't come through, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=111.97999999999999s)]
*  he's going to have a lot of people turning on him. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=114.84s)]
*  Still don't understand that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=117.8s)]
*  I'll give him some time. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=118.8s)]
*  I'm hopeful. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=120.06s)]
*  Why do we treat this guy like a baby? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=120.9s)]
*  Like isn't it just so utterly obvious? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=122.06s)]
*  I'll show you here. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=124.86s)]
*  I'm not sure this guy's political affiliation, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=125.7s)]
*  but he runs a factory in Arizona [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=127.34s)]
*  and he's explaining how the tariffs are just [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=130.76s)]
*  from a business perspective, just hurting his factories. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=134.2s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=136.7s)]
*  Matt Mandel helps run Sunfed, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=137.84s)]
*  this warehouse just a few miles from the border. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=139.94s)]
*  100 days into the Trump presidency, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=142.5s)]
*  your business has been impacted how? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=145.26s)]
*  The biggest problem that we have up till now is uncertainty. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=147.16s)]
*  We have talk about tariffs and then the tariffs are off. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  We have tariffs that came into play for three days. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=154.56s)]
*  They were canceled, but the constant threat of what if, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=157.16s)]
*  makes it very hard for us to plan. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=160.45999999999998s)]
*  The border crossing at Nogales is almost always humming. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=164.16s)]
*  Commerce both ways caught up in 100 days [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=167.89999999999998s)]
*  of Trump trade turmoil. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  Food does not make sense at all. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=172.16s)]
*  All you're gonna do is raise those costs to consumers. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=174.6s)]
*  People have become accustomed to having all their fruits [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=176.89999999999998s)]
*  and vegetables on a year round basis [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=180.0s)]
*  and that is entirely due to imports. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  Putting tariffs on imports is only gonna limit supply, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=183.33999999999997s)]
*  raise prices. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=187.14s)]
*  Now there's a ton of stories like that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=189.33999999999997s)]
*  I could show you more, but I think you get the point. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=191.14s)]
*  So what are the MAGA Republicans in Arizona doing? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=192.83999999999997s)]
*  How are they addressing this? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=197.0s)]
*  Well, the big initiative that they've been focused on [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  is trying to rename all of their highways [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=200.98000000000002s)]
*  after Donald Trump. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  There's a law in Arizona that says you can't name [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  the highways or especially all of them [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=208.36s)]
*  after somebody unless they are dead, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=211.12s)]
*  but they really tried to push this through. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=214.5s)]
*  It lost with one vote, not because they didn't wanna do it, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=217.5s)]
*  but because it would have been against the existing law [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  because you can't do it, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=222.5s)]
*  but that's the type of things that they're focused on. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=223.8s)]
*  So what are Democrats fighting for? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=226.5s)]
*  What are people who care about people fighting for? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=228.28s)]
*  Let's bring in Deja Fox, Democrat running [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  in the special election for Arizona's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  seventh congressional district. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=237.74s)]
*  The elections right around the corner, July 15th, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  just about less than two months away, even at this point. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=242.28s)]
*  So Deja, you've been traveling your district, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=245.94s)]
*  but you've traveled Arizona as well. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=248.74s)]
*  What are you seeing there right now? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, just after the Republicans attempted [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=255.1s)]
*  to push through their budget bill, right? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=259.14s)]
*  That would strip Medicaid funding, snap benefits [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=261.78s)]
*  from folks all across the country, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=265.18s)]
*  but hundreds of thousands of them right here in Arizona [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=267.18s)]
*  in congressional district seven, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=270.38s)]
*  we gathered storytellers in my living room [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=272.3s)]
*  in a really intimate session to talk about the impacts [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=275.12s)]
*  of Medicaid cuts. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=278.68s)]
*  And I heard from a neonatal doctor, I mean, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=279.68s)]
*  someone who takes care of our most vulnerable, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=282.06s)]
*  our tiniest among us, who says that half of babies born [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=283.98s)]
*  in Arizona are born under access, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  which is Arizona's version of Medicaid. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=291.14000000000004s)]
*  So let's be clear, there's nothing pro-family [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=292.86s)]
*  about what these Republicans are doing. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=295.46000000000004s)]
*  I also heard from a young woman who was on a pre-med track [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=297.38s)]
*  in school, but when her mother was diagnosed with cancer, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=301.64000000000004s)]
*  they had to make a tough decision to delay her care, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  to be able to afford the cost of living, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=307.56s)]
*  and she lost her mother because of that delaying care. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=309.66s)]
*  And these are the stories that we hear time and time again. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=313.26000000000005s)]
*  And, you know, I think about one man who came [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=316.06s)]
*  to that roundtable, he introduced himself as James [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=318.22s)]
*  from the neighborhood, and he had never been [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=321.42s)]
*  to a political event before. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=324.46000000000004s)]
*  And he didn't share much, but when we asked, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=326.1s)]
*  what was your message at the end [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=328.3s)]
*  to these Republicans pushing this budget bill through [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=330.14000000000004s)]
*  to line the pockets of billionaires at the expense [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=332.70000000000005s)]
*  of our families and our healthcare, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=335.08000000000004s)]
*  he asked how could these elected officials, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=336.90000000000003s)]
*  these representatives make these decisions [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=340.14000000000004s)]
*  if they had ever sat with people like us? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=342.48s)]
*  And this is the frustration we're hearing [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=345.76s)]
*  on the ground in Arizona, and I'll say across the country, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=347.68s)]
*  right, I see it all the time on the internet [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=351.6s)]
*  and the TikTok comment sections and so much further, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=353.70000000000005s)]
*  that people are frustrated, they feel unseen, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=357.20000000000005s)]
*  and really are asking how can they make [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=359.92s)]
*  these inhumane decisions? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=362.76s)]
*  And the answer is that they are catering [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=364.44s)]
*  to their billionaire buddies, not you. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=366.32s)]
*  Now, Deja, you graduated with a full scholarship [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=369.26s)]
*  to Columbia University, but you share your story [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=372.82s)]
*  with people, you're 25 years old now, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=377.22s)]
*  you represent a new generation of leadership, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=379.02000000000004s)]
*  not just for the Democratic Party, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=381.8s)]
*  but just in general in our country, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=383.6s)]
*  but you were on SNAP benefits, food stamps, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=385.86s)]
*  you were Section 8 housing, which is housed under HUD, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=389.26s)]
*  you were a Medicaid recipient. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=394.1s)]
*  All of those programs are precisely [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=396.94s)]
*  what Republicans are attacking in your district [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=401.38s)]
*  and throughout the rest of the country. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=405.41999999999996s)]
*  So there's also your personal story in this as well, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=407.38s)]
*  and you being an example of someone [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  who graduated from Columbia, who's now a leader, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=415.02s)]
*  and it just seems like Republicans see your story, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=418.85999999999996s)]
*  and you are who they fear. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=423.12s)]
*  They wanna stop the future Deja Foxes [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=426.78s)]
*  because they want more Andy Biggs. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=429.06s)]
*  Yeah, this is the American dream story [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=432.21999999999997s)]
*  that they all say they support, right? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=434.35999999999996s)]
*  That because of good policy, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=436.94s)]
*  I was raised by a single mom, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=439.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm a first generation American, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=440.35999999999996s)]
*  and I was raised in Section 8 housing, right? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=443.14s)]
*  That's what put a roof over my head. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=445.94s)]
*  SNAP benefits, food stamps, put food on our table, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=447.21999999999997s)]
*  and my mom worked every odd job. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=450.06s)]
*  I mean, she delivered flowers, she worked at a post office, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=451.64s)]
*  she cleaned houses to make ends meet, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=454.62s)]
*  and we needed a little help to get by [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=458.78000000000003s)]
*  at the end of the month. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=461.14s)]
*  I mean, there were times where we had to choose [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=461.98s)]
*  between bills and back to school clothes. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=463.66s)]
*  It's something that so many families understand, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=465.78000000000003s)]
*  but those social safety nets, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=468.62s)]
*  those programs are not handouts, they're hand ups, right? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=470.74s)]
*  They made it possible for me to be the first in my family [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=474.62s)]
*  to go to college, and my first advocacy battle [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=477.94s)]
*  had everything to do with that American dream story. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=482.08s)]
*  I think about during the first Trump administration, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=486.08s)]
*  when Republicans here in Arizona voted in lockstep with him [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  to defund Planned Parenthood Center, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=493.2s)]
*  something else that was in that budget bill, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=494.84s)]
*  and these are the places where I got my healthcare, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=497.32s)]
*  where I got birth control when I had no money [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=499.71999999999997s)]
*  and no parents and no insurance at 16 years old. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=502.08s)]
*  I walked into a Planned Parenthood and walked out [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=504.79999999999995s)]
*  with the birth control I needed [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  to take control of my body and my future [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=508.68s)]
*  and go on to be the first in my family to go to college. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=510.58s)]
*  And I think about that as sort of this, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=513.9399999999999s)]
*  you know, that subway door, elevator door moment [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=516.42s)]
*  in which things could have gone a different direction for me. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=519.02s)]
*  But because of good policy, Title X funding, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=522.02s)]
*  Planned Parenthood Centers, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=524.26s)]
*  I was able to go the step further [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=525.74s)]
*  to achieve that American dream, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=529.18s)]
*  and now I'm running for office [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=530.78s)]
*  because I feel a deep sense of responsibility [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=531.9399999999999s)]
*  to the version of my younger self who's out there right now. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=534.6999999999999s)]
*  That girl who cannot wait [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=537.66s)]
*  until this Trump administration is over, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=539.5s)]
*  who deserves care now, families like mine, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=541.22s)]
*  who need food and housing now, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=544.5400000000001s)]
*  and my community members who need healthcare, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=548.1s)]
*  not in three years, but today. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=550.82s)]
*  You know, as I hear your story, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=554.46s)]
*  I think about a few of the phone calls [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=556.14s)]
*  I've been getting recently [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=559.02s)]
*  since that New York Times story was out [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=560.7800000000001s)]
*  about the left needs a Joe Rogan, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=563.26s)]
*  and we gotta find out. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=566.58s)]
*  And I say to them, I said, look, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=568.22s)]
*  if you go and you speak to American people at town halls [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=570.6600000000001s)]
*  or in the living rooms, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=573.9s)]
*  I go, there's not a single person [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=575.1s)]
*  other than these narratives that are out there [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=576.94s)]
*  wanting a left version of a Joe Rogan. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=580.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, people want housing, they want an education, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=583.26s)]
*  they want affordable healthcare, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=587.62s)]
*  they want to allow women [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=589.74s)]
*  to have their own reproductive rights, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=591.34s)]
*  they want men to get the hell out of it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=593.0600000000001s)]
*  They want to be able to live an American dream [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=595.14s)]
*  and to not have the psychological torture [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=598.98s)]
*  of living paycheck to paycheck. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=601.02s)]
*  We need to spend time talking about those things [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=603.06s)]
*  and less time talking about manufacturing a Joe Rogan [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=606.9s)]
*  in a lab, which is incredibly problematic [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=612.18s)]
*  for reasons that would take an hour more [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=615.3s)]
*  for us to get into here. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=617.86s)]
*  But as we kind of wrap this up, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=619.18s)]
*  talk to us about your district, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=622.38s)]
*  it's a competitive race that you have in this special. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=624.7s)]
*  So why you, why now, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=628.98s)]
*  why should the voters be looking at you? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=631.5400000000001s)]
*  Like I said, my name is Deja Fox [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=634.5400000000001s)]
*  and I'm running in Arizona's seventh congressional district. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=636.02s)]
*  It's a special election that opened up [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=638.94s)]
*  because my member of Congress passed away. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=641.9s)]
*  And we have seen the conversation around age [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=645.14s)]
*  coming to a head in our party and in our country. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=648.3000000000001s)]
*  Just in the past few months, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=651.66s)]
*  three Democrats have passed away [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=652.9s)]
*  while in office in Congress, right? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=655.26s)]
*  And when we think about that budget bill, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=658.06s)]
*  that passed by a single vote [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=660.54s)]
*  and has the potential to strip millions [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=663.02s)]
*  of their access to healthcare, right? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=665.5s)]
*  Take food off the table of our most vulnerable families, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=667.42s)]
*  just to put money in the pockets of billionaires. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=670.4599999999999s)]
*  We need to be having a conversation about age. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=672.9399999999999s)]
*  And I'm 25 years old. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=676.8199999999999s)]
*  I would be the youngest member of Congress. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=678.3399999999999s)]
*  I'd be the first woman of my generation, Gen Z. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=680.1s)]
*  We have an opportunity to make history in this election, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=682.4200000000001s)]
*  but it's coming up fast. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=685.58s)]
*  Early ballots drop in the month. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=686.78s)]
*  I mean, they are literally coming out in no time. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=689.0600000000001s)]
*  And our election is July 15th, less than 50 days away. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=693.34s)]
*  And I wanted to share one story about why me, why now. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=697.7s)]
*  We shared this frustration around Donald Trump, right? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=702.82s)]
*  We've heard Republicans say [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=706.0600000000001s)]
*  that he is not living up to the promises, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=707.4200000000001s)]
*  which he is a grifter and we know this, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=709.34s)]
*  but we are also hearing a frustration with Democrats [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=712.02s)]
*  for not standing up, for not doing what they promised. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=715.38s)]
*  And I wanna share that though I'm young, I'm 25, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=719.7s)]
*  I'm not new to this work. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=722.94s)]
*  I've been at it since I was 15 for the last decade [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=724.26s)]
*  when my mom was struggling with substance abuse, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=727.7s)]
*  navigating a rehabilitation process. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=730.74s)]
*  I was all on my own at 15 years old. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=733.1s)]
*  And at the very same time, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=735.7s)]
*  I was seated in a sex education class. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=737.38s)]
*  And this was a curriculum that was last updated in the 80s, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=740.5s)]
*  didn't mention consent, was medically inaccurate [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=743.1s)]
*  and made my life harder. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=746.82s)]
*  When I was already working at a gas station, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=749.9399999999999s)]
*  fighting a real uphill battle on my own. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=753.54s)]
*  And it was the kind of thing [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=756.78s)]
*  that my school board members elected had decades to fix. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=757.9s)]
*  And yet they didn't. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=762.26s)]
*  It took a young person like me showing up [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=763.7s)]
*  and demanding better organizing and telling vulnerable stories. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=766.62s)]
*  And there was a mix of both Republicans [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=770.58s)]
*  and Democrats on that school board. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=773.1s)]
*  And this points out the larger problem with our democracy [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=775.58s)]
*  is that elected officials are out of touch [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=779.1s)]
*  with the needs of their constituents. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=782.26s)]
*  And I'll share that I am actually running [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=784.34s)]
*  against one of those school board members now [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=786.46s)]
*  because I believe that we need to not only fight back [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=789.1s)]
*  against Donald Trump and these bag of extremists, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=791.9s)]
*  but demand that Democrats do better. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=794.9s)]
*  And I'm in this race because I know what it means [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=797.98s)]
*  to be a fighter. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=800.66s)]
*  I've been fighting for the last decade. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=801.6999999999999s)]
*  And I had to ask myself the tough question [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=804.02s)]
*  I hope you'll ask, which is when everything was on the line, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=805.74s)]
*  will you be able to say you did everything you could? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=808.6999999999999s)]
*  And who do you trust to stand between Donald Trump [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=811.42s)]
*  and your mom's access to healthcare, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=814.1s)]
*  your grandmother's social security check, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=815.9s)]
*  your daughter's ability to make choices about her body? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=817.5s)]
*  Deja Fox running for Arizona's 7th congressional district. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw5n3fCXm0&t=821.62s)]
