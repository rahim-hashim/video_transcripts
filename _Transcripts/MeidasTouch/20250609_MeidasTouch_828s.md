# EXCLUSIVE: Newsom STRIKES BACK as Trump DEPLOYS MARINES
**MeidasTouch:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk)
*  I'm joined by California Governor Gavin Newsom. Governor Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth just [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=0.0s)]
*  wrote, due to increased threats to federal law enforcement officers and federal buildings, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=5.84s)]
*  approximately 700 active duty U.S. Marines from Camp Pendleton are being deployed to Los Angeles [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=10.64s)]
*  to restore order. We have an obligation to defend federal law enforcement officers, even if Gavin [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=16.64s)]
*  Newsom will not. That was his post. What's your response, Governor? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=22.16s)]
*  It's just complete nonsense. It's Orwellian. It's a manufactured crisis. Let me give you a [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=25.44s)]
*  proof point of that. As we all know well, they illegally and unconstitutionally deployed the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=30.32s)]
*  National Guard over the objection of the governor, over my objection, and we filed a lawsuit on that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  There were 2,000 National Guardsmen deployed, but they cannot operationalize the needs for [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=43.92s)]
*  more than 300 of them, meaning 1,700 of them have not been utilized in any meaningful way. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=50.48s)]
*  Just moments ago, they also called up an additional 2,000 National Guards. So now 4,000, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=58.31999999999999s)]
*  of which only 300 have been operationalized. And guess what? Guess what? Yesterday, LAPD had to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=64.56s)]
*  protect and use their scarce resources to protect those National Guardsmen and women against protests [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=71.52s)]
*  that were incited because of their presence. And I say this as someone who's very proud of our [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=79.68s)]
*  National Guard and care deeply about them. They are being put into harm's way. And Donald Trump [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=84.0s)]
*  has created and manufactured a crisis that I assure you, to your tweet in the reference to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=90.48s)]
*  Hexsets, is going to be made significantly worse if they impose the Insurrection Act and deploy 700 [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=95.68s)]
*  active Marines and military into a U.S. American city in this manufactured crisis. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=104.24s)]
*  We saw that there were National Guardsmen sleeping on the floor. There was no food, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  water, or places to sleep for them. Here's what you posted. You sent your troops here without fuel, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=116.56s)]
*  food, water, or a place to sleep. Here they are being forced to sleep on the floor piled on top [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  of one another. If anyone is treating our troops disrespectfully, it is you. And is this the group [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=128.24s)]
*  that's just even the 300 that they did operationalize so they couldn't operationalize the 17th? What are [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=135.28s)]
*  we looking at there even? You're looking at chaos. You're looking at incompetency. You're looking, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=141.84s)]
*  I think, at the visuals of what this is all about. They are unhinged. They're incapable [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  of operational efficiency. I mean, these are the soldiers. This is the 79th Infantry. I know these [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  guys well. They're under our command. They've been under my command. They're amazing young men and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=163.92s)]
*  women. These were the folks out there protecting people in the middle of the wildfires here in LA. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=169.92s)]
*  They were protecting public safety at key checkpoints all throughout the state. These are [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=175.2s)]
*  the folks I've deployed that are now being pulled off the line to do forest management and vegetation [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  management, preparing for wildfire season. These are the folks that are currently being deployed, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=186.08s)]
*  now are being sent here for this theater of the absurdity that we're working on fentanyl [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  interdiction and doing task force work, our rattlesnake crews, all of these extraordinary [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=196.96s)]
*  things that no longer can be done or at least are disrupted because of this show. And that's all of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=202.4s)]
*  this. All this is we have more than enough resources. The mutual aid system has not even [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=209.52s)]
*  been close to being tapped as it relates to local law enforcement. And I'll remind you, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=214.56s)]
*  LA County has 88 cities. The vast majority of those cities have their own police departments, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=219.68s)]
*  the California Highway Patrol. We've surged about 600 officers. And as I just noted, and as you just [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=225.84s)]
*  showed your viewers, you've got 1700 of these young men and women that are sitting around [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=233.04s)]
*  waiting for something and another 2000 have been nationalized. Again, just so Donald Trump [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=240.24s)]
*  can pound his chest and act like he is in control. He is creating chaos. He is sowing chaos. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=246.72s)]
*  – Governor, is there anyone in the Trump administration or the Secretary of Defense [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=255.36s)]
*  or the Defense Department or Department of Homeland Security who's coordinating or communicating [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=261.2s)]
*  any of this with you or are you mostly finding out by tweets and by posts and Trump's press [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=267.35999999999996s)]
*  conferences? – Let's talk about the great Kristi Noem, who not that many months ago was on with one [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  of the mouse pieces, the PR machine for the Trump administration, Sean Hannity, not that many months [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  ago as Governor Noem condemning the Biden administration because there was some discussion, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  as you've heard to it, as threat to freedom and state sovereignty because there was a chance that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=296.4s)]
*  her National Guard was going to be federalized. She condemned it. Hannity shook his head in disgust [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  about the incompetency of the Biden administration. That incompetency and hypocrisy is on full [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=310.0s)]
*  display right now. No coordination, no capacity to engage in a rational deployment strategy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=316.08s)]
*  Currently, 1700, if I haven't made that clear enough, of the first 2000 cohort that have not [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=325.12s)]
*  been deployed and the threat of the US Marines coming in to a city in the United States of America [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=331.76s)]
*  in 2025, which would require the Insurrection Act in this manufactured crisis that is going to create [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=340.72s)]
*  conditions that we are desperately trying to mitigate. This chaos is manufactured and it's [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=348.8s)]
*  my job as governor working with local law enforcement to clean up their mess. – Donald [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=358.4s)]
*  Trump earlier today echoed what his borders czar Tom Homan said, which is that they want you arrested. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=364.64s)]
*  Trump was asked why he wants you arrested. He says because you're the governor and you won election [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  that's one of the reasons he wants you arrested. What's your response to that, Governor? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=378.32s)]
*  Was that said by Erdogan? Who was that said by? Was that some dictator, some authoritarian in the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=383.92s)]
*  history books? Or was that said by the President of the United States? I've never thought honestly, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=390.88s)]
*  and I don't want to be hyperbolic, act like a victim and all that. I honestly, literally never [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=394.56s)]
*  thought in my life I'd hear those words uttered from the President of the United States. Threatening [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  the arrest, directing the arrest of a political opponent that quote unquote won an election [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=405.28s)]
*  and happens to be governor of the largest state in our country. And for what? Not only winning [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=411.67999999999995s)]
*  the election, but it's really about having the audacity to call him out on his unconstitutional [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=419.35999999999996s)]
*  actions and to call out what this is all about. This is about the erosion of the rule of law. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=425.44s)]
*  This is about a system of checks and balances, popular sovereignty, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=433.6s)]
*  co-equal branches of government. We lost a full branch of government. It's gone. And that's [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=438.72s)]
*  Congress. There's no oversight. There's only one other branch outside the executive that may or [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=444.0s)]
*  may not be left. And that's the branch he's threatening with impeachment. And he's threatening [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  as it relates to court actions that he may or may not follow depending on the rule of Don. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  And that's the courts. And that's what we've got left. And so we have to stand up. We have to call [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=460.16s)]
*  out what this is really about. We have crossed the red line. We can get into a posse comitatus. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=465.84s)]
*  We can get into this unlawful action. But this is a national action that is occurring first here in [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=472.24s)]
*  the state of California. The executive order and the mobilization order that came from the DOD [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  impacts every state in the United States of America. Democrats and Republicans should wake [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=483.52s)]
*  up to what is happening currently in this country. And it's happening here first, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=489.76s)]
*  but we are just America's coming attraction. This is a preview of things to come all across the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=495.28s)]
*  country. You know, yeah, that unlawful order is not specific to California or Los Angeles, right? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=500.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's a 60 day order that says and it's not limited to just it mentions. Yes, it starts [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=506.96s)]
*  with this National Guard federalization, but it says at the Secretary of Defense's discretion [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=513.84s)]
*  could be anything for 60 days anywhere. I don't think that's getting enough attention. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=520.4s)]
*  No, I mean, people need to understand this is a national order. We're talking about you in your [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=525.04s)]
*  state in your backyard, depending on the whim of a president who's unhinged, depending on how he's [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=530.88s)]
*  feeling in a particular day or who's engraved him because they didn't like what they said on a Fox [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=538.48s)]
*  News clip. I mean, it's again, sober and serious moment. Meanwhile, can I just add, you know, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=544.64s)]
*  and this is why I told the president just just get it over with, arrest me, move on. If you need [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=552.0s)]
*  some head to scalp, do it with me. But stop messing with these kids. Stop messing with [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=558.56s)]
*  four year olds, kids in elementary school. We've got kids. We have hundreds of graduations down [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=563.5999999999999s)]
*  here. Kids are not going in their own graduations, families, grandparents here legally mixed status [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=569.1999999999999s)]
*  families in some cases scared to death to go to a graduation. People are scared to draw walk down [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=574.4799999999999s)]
*  the streets. It's not just Home Depot's getting their car washed. We have incidences. I didn't [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=579.68s)]
*  believe it because I what was I thinking actually believe when they said this is not true. But then [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=584.4s)]
*  I saw videos they're doing checkpoints checking people's IDs. We've never seen this kind of [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  deployment in so many actions. It's mass panic out here in the nation's largest county in the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=594.9599999999999s)]
*  nation's largest state. Good, hardworking people, decent people. These are not the criminals. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=601.04s)]
*  These are not the thugs. And so again, I just told people really are paying attention. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=606.72s)]
*  And I know he's trying to misdirect attention away from Elon Musk and this disastrous two and a half [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=614.48s)]
*  trillion dollar debt that's going to saddle our kids and grandkids for generations. And the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=620.3199999999999s)]
*  abomination that is his terror policy and his incompetency as it relates to foreign affairs, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=625.92s)]
*  do not fall for it. Let's all pay attention to what's really going on. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=631.12s)]
*  And what I find interesting, though, is, you know, he'll be a keyboard warrior, and he'll say new [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=635.68s)]
*  scum this and that. But he when you're face to face with him and you're in front of the cameras [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=640.96s)]
*  and you're there together, he becomes a different person. You look him in the face. I remember [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=647.2s)]
*  during the wildfires and he was like a different person when you were there together. But back [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=652.1600000000001s)]
*  wherever he is, he's, you know, new stuff this and that. And to me, I don't know, I just look at that, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=658.0s)]
*  you know, just as as a man, I look at Trump and I'm like, that's that's pathetic. If you really [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=663.9200000000001s)]
*  feel this way about this guy, about Governor Newsom, just say it to his face, then do it in public. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=669.28s)]
*  Weakness masquerading as strength, weakness masquerading as strength. Look, I had that [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=674.4s)]
*  conversation with him Friday night, just a few nights ago. It was unbelievably cordial. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=679.76s)]
*  He never brought up the National Guard. He never he didn't want to talk about what was going on [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=685.12s)]
*  in L.A. That's why we were connected. I was talking to his chief of staff or texting her back and [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=688.9599999999999s)]
*  forth. And I picked up the phone to talk to the president about this. Wasn't interested. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=693.36s)]
*  And then a few hours later, he nationalizes, federalizes the National Guard. He lays claim [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=697.68s)]
*  that somehow it had solved all the problems and the Guard hadn't even officially been deployed. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=703.52s)]
*  Completely lied about that, lied about our conversation, said he discussed the National [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=708.24s)]
*  Guard with us, with me specifically. But to your point, it is a surreal experience to have that [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=712.32s)]
*  kind of interaction. And then hours later be called what I think Maurice Bignan, I can't remember his [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=719.76s)]
*  name. My eighth grade bully called me new scum. I mean, it's the president United States calling [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=726.24s)]
*  someone what an eighth grade bully called me when I was a kid, rather pathetic. So what would be [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=732.08s)]
*  your message to him right now this evening? Stand back, rescind this absurd, illegal and immoral [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=739.84s)]
*  order. Let our military go home. The absurdity of threatening the people of the United States [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=748.88s)]
*  of America with their own military, our proud military, these remarkable men and women in [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=756.96s)]
*  uniform that do heroic work, really proud of our Marines. I feel for them right now. I feel for [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=763.4399999999999s)]
*  our National Guard to be there. And the fact that we had to send the PD, our local PD to protect our [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=769.6s)]
*  own National Guard because they're being used as pawns, Mr. President, show some decency. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=777.12s)]
*  I show some humanity, more importantly, act like the commander in chief. If you want to be president, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=783.6s)]
*  you might as well play the part as president, at least fake it. Do the right thing. Stand back [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRcF6DaC0Wk&t=790.88s)]
