*  You know this congressmember right here and this MAGA Republican [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=498.85999999999996s)]

*  What we want to do in our budget is we want to transfer the federal obligations of Medicaid right now [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=513.72s)]
*  It's 90% feds 10% state. We want the whole states to handle it. They're telling you their plan is to cut Medicaid [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=519.42s)]
*  I mean listen just listen to what they're saying here play this clip [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=525.64s)]
*  FMAF is the federal [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=530.1s)]
*  Medical assistance percentage and it ranges from 50% in the country to 76.9% now when the when the Dems expanded [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=532.18s)]
*  Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=540.38s)]
*  They made that percentage match [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=543.14s)]
*  90-10 so the federal government is paying 90% of the Medicaid expansion [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=545.66s)]
*  And so what we have talked about is moving that 90% [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=550.34s)]
*  level of the expansion back towards the more traditional levels of 52 to approximately 80% [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=554.98s)]
*  Instead instead of the 90-10 90% being federal 10% being state match and nobody would be kicked off of Medicaid [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=562.22s)]
*  as long as the governors [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=569.46s)]
*  Decided that they wanted to continue to fund the program and so we are gonna ask the states to pick up and pay [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=572.26s)]
*  Some additional percentage of the Medicaid percentage and as American Bridge 21st century says if Republicans cut federal funding for Medicaid [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=579.9000000000001s)]
*  Expansion millions will lose their health care [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=588.14s)]
*  There's a number of states with trigger laws that automatically end Medicaid if the federal funding is cut [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=590.1800000000001s)]
*  So anywhere everywhere from Arizona to Arkansas to Idaho to Illinois they have these trigger laws [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=598.04s)]
*  And so it's effectively destroying [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=604.68s)]
*  Medicaid and that's their that's their plan right with Trump's plan is well will have [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=607.92s)]
*  You know we don't need FEMA the states will do FEMA [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=612.92s)]
*  No [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=616.28s)]
*  The federal government needs to do federal emergency relief because the states don't have the resources [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=616.62s)]
*  The very reason why there's a federal government is to know is to deal with these things like oh we don't need a Department of Education [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=623.0s)]
*  Except when it comes to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=631.8s)]
*  Garnishing wages of students who are defaulted on their loans right you had McMahon Linda McMahon the Department of Education [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=634.3199999999999s)]
*  Secretary destroy the Department of Education, but go after students here. This is her saying you're right here [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=641.4799999999999s)]
*  I know you like to get into the details [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=646.4799999999999s)]
*  So let's talk about the plans the structure and the period of time to one [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=648.6s)]
*  Get money back if you're a taxpayer in the sense of no more payoffs buyouts or whatever that the Biden administration left in place [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=654.08s)]
*  Well, thank you David and you and Lisa both for having me on this afternoon [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=662.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, the plan is very simple. We we have announced that beginning May 5th [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=667.9200000000001s)]
*  You must start to repay your loan and this is not to in any way try to cause hardship [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=672.44s)]
*  There are several different payment plans that you can access [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=678.6s)]
*  Oh, and then you have Joe Rogan again talking about the importance of due process [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=683.78s)]
*  Yeah, you get Rogan talking about due process here play this clip about due process. No fuck that well [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=689.62s)]
*  Here's the problem with fuck that the problem with things that are going in a radical direction and send it then there's an overcorrection [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=695.0s)]
*  So the overcorrection is lack of due process the overcorrection is like round them all up [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=701.64s)]
*  Ship them to jail like that's like some things that you say when you're not thinking things through like what do you do about all? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=707.4s)]
*  The criminals take them all fucking send them to El Salvador. Yeah, what about due process? No fuck that [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=713.12s)]
*  Well, here's the problem with fuck that what if you are an enemy of let's not say any current president [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=719.32s)]
*  let's pretend we got a new president totally new guy in 2028 and [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=726.44s)]
*  This is a common practice now of just rounding up gang members with no due process and shipping them to El Salvador [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=731.52s)]
*  You're a gang member. No, I'm not prove it. What I go to court. No, no due process [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=738.92s)]
*  That's dangerous that's dangerous that's dangerous [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=745.68s)]
*  That's we got to be careful that we don't become monsters while we're fighting monsters [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=749.8s)]
*  I think due process exists for a reason and the reason is it is horrific [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=754.66s)]
*  For someone to be accused of something they didn't do be imprisoned for crimes [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=759.38s)]
*  They didn't commit and then live in a cell live in a cage with a bunch of people who did commit shit here [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=763.02s)]
*  It is Benjamin Franklin. It's better a hundred guilty person should escape than one innocent person should suffer that that is wisdom [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=769.78s)]
*  Yeah, that has survived hundreds of years. It's incredibly accurate and it is the foundation of [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=777.54s)]
*  Freedom like we have to make sure that these people are actually guilty. Otherwise, we become monsters [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=784.74s)]
*  You can't like what is that when you're fighting monsters? Be careful that you don't become one come on. Yeah. Yeah, that's very important [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=790.62s)]
*  This is very important. You know, you can't do that [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=797.86s)]
*  You know, it's one of those things where [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=802.38s)]
*  To support one side of this you have to deny [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=804.86s)]
*  Some like basic human values either way like to support just rounding people up and [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=809.38s)]
*  Just assuming they're all gang members [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=816.02s)]
*  I don't not saying they're doing that but this is the worst case scenario, right? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=817.98s)]
*  They get a bunch of people in a room [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=821.34s)]
*  They rope them all in and one guy's just someone's cousin picking someone up to give him a ride home [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=823.02s)]
*  That's possible and now you're back on the one [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=827.22s)]
*  It's a person with now you're right back and what if that dude is not doing anything wrong and he's got some stupid tattoos [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=829.02s)]
*  And they decide that this guy's a gang member now now you're in a prison in El Salvador and you're not even from El Salvador [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=834.2199999999999s)]
*  And now you know, you were just a hairdresser or you're a tattoo artist family man [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=839.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you came over here and maybe you got a green card and maybe you don't maybe you were just given [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=844.6199999999999s)]
*  Asylum because a lot of people from Venezuela were given asylum in America [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=850.04s)]
*  Yeah, and then you get shipped to El Salvador where you're not even from El Salvador [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=853.8199999999999s)]
*  So that the fact that that exists scares the shit out of me and then Elon Musk on an earnings call [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=858.0600000000001s)]
*  whining about tariffs here, let's play it. I just want to emphasize that [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=865.42s)]
*  Plus this the tariff decision is entirely up to the president of the United States [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=870.1800000000001s)]
*  I will weigh in with my advice with the president which he [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=874.26s)]
*  He will listen to my advice, but then it's up to him of course to make his decision [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=879.1s)]
*  I [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=883.66s)]
*  Have been on the record many times is saying that I believe lower tariffs are generally a good idea or prosperity [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=885.66s)]
*  But this decision is fundamentally up to the elected representative of the people being the president of the United States. So [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=893.5799999999999s)]
*  You know I'll continue to advocate for [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=901.18s)]
*  Lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but that's all I can do [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=905.06s)]
*  so [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=909.86s)]
*  Anyway, you you you hear it for yourself right there. Let me know what you think [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8bvGe9Nl_Q&t=911.58s)]
