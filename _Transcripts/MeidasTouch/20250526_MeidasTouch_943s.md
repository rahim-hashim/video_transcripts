# All HELL BREAKS LOOSE as Trump CAVES in Public
**MeidasTouch:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A)
*  You see, with Donald Trump, it's the art of weakness, the art of surrender. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=0.0s)]
*  That clip I just shared with you were the sound of drones being sent by Russia, Shaheed [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  drones into Kiev, bombing Kiev, killing over a dozen people on Kiev Day, celebrating the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=16.32s)]
*  1500 years since Kiev was first founded. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=25.12s)]
*  And Russia sees Donald Trump's actions, Putin sees Donald Trump's actions as pure weakness, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=29.76s)]
*  as Donald Trump refuses to be involved in any type of negotiations anymore between [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=36.88s)]
*  Putin and Ukraine. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=44.24s)]
*  In fact, Donald Trump seemed to be cheerleading for Putin, if anything. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=46.0s)]
*  And then you have that as a result. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=50.64s)]
*  Zelensky also called Donald Trump out for his silence and saying, basically, silence [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  is complicity at this point. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=58.8s)]
*  You're giving Putin a pass. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=60.8s)]
*  As I said at the outset, when it comes to Donald Trump, it's the art of surrender. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=62.16s)]
*  It's the art of defeat. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=66.56s)]
*  It's the art of weakness. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump, over the weekend again, also announced that those 50% tariffs he threatened [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=69.44s)]
*  against the European Union, what was it? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=75.92s)]
*  Two days ago, three days ago at this point, that he is going to delay imposing the 50% [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=78.88s)]
*  tariffs on Europe, which was going to take place in like five days. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  He's going to be now moving the next deadline to, I think he says July 9th, because he got [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=90.96s)]
*  a call from the president of the European Commission, Ursula von Drilley, and he said, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=96.72s)]
*  okay, okay. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  Then he tries to pretend that that's a victory. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=102.72s)]
*  It's the art of weakness. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=105.28s)]
*  It's the art of surrender. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  As our editor in chief at the Midas Touch Network, Ron Filipkowski, who you know and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=108.48s)]
*  love, here's how he describes it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=112.48s)]
*  Trump reduced the tariffs on China in exchange for nothing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=116.4s)]
*  He capitulated. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=121.12s)]
*  He caved. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=122.08s)]
*  Trump paused the tariffs on Canada and Mexico in exchange for nothing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=123.04s)]
*  He just postponed the tariffs on EU in exchange for nothing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=127.12s)]
*  He threatened Russia with sanctions if they didn't sign a ceasefire and then did nothing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=130.88s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump believes is the art of the deal. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=136.0s)]
*  But it's really just caveman Trump because he keeps on caving, always giving in on tariffs [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  at the deadline while getting no deals in return. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  Concepts of deals, though, lots of stuff happening behind the scenes. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=148.56s)]
*  Any day now, I guess that golden age is going to be here. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  No, Trump's turned the United States of America into the laughing stock of the world. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=156.0s)]
*  I saw something on the Council of Foreign Relations recently where one of the speakers [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=161.36s)]
*  said the United States is even doing something that Russia didn't do. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=167.36s)]
*  The United States is both making itself weaker on the international stage and destroying [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=170.56s)]
*  the basic functioning of the day-to-day governance. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=176.24s)]
*  Ron Filipkowski, our editor in chief, also writes the following. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=180.56s)]
*  On Sunday, Donald Trump says that he's not happy with Putin. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  He goes, he's not happy with Putin bombing civilians every day. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=188.32s)]
*  But it's only because Trump's dream of a Nobel Peace Prize isn't happening. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=192.72s)]
*  He won't do anything about it, though, except say he's unhappy and then go back to golf. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=198.0s)]
*  And then like he did yesterday, what was he posting? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=204.16s)]
*  A photo while he was golfing of a swan attacking his golf buddy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=206.56s)]
*  Donald Trump thought that that was something that he should post. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=212.56s)]
*  Incidentally, our editor in chief, Ron Filipkowski, explained, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  I think that's the swan at Bedminster at the 16th hole that guards the grave of Ivana, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=219.12s)]
*  Donald Trump's first wife, who he buried at Bedminster in kind of the marsh area actually [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=225.04s)]
*  by that hole so that Donald Trump could potentially claim tax deductions by calling [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=230.32s)]
*  Bedminster, his golf course, a cemetery. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=236.88s)]
*  And then Ron Filipkowski also writes, really, Trump's surprised that Putin doesn't want [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=240.56s)]
*  peace. Shocked. Shocked, I tell you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=245.44s)]
*  So here's what Donald Trump said yesterday, just so you can kind of see for yourself. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=249.12s)]
*  A reporter asks him, you mentioned you're unhappy with Putin. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=254.16s)]
*  You've talked before about more sanctions. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=258.32s)]
*  Is that something you're considering? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=260.72s)]
*  And then Donald Trump goes on this weird rant. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=262.72s)]
*  He's like, I'm shocked. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=265.2s)]
*  What the hell happened to him? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=266.72s)]
*  This is not the Putin I know. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  I've known him for a long time. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=270.08s)]
*  Can you believe this? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=271.52s)]
*  Yes, we can believe he's Putin. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=272.64s)]
*  He's a genocidal maniac. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=274.64s)]
*  We can absolutely believe that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=277.12s)]
*  But you were the one who promised everybody that on day one in 24 hours, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=279.36s)]
*  you were going to bring peace to Ukraine, you said, because of your relationship with Putin [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  and Zelensky. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=288.0s)]
*  But you are an absolute liar. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=288.8s)]
*  But here, play this clip. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=290.24s)]
*  You mentioned you're unhappy with President Putin. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=291.36s)]
*  You've talked before about putting more sanctions on Russia. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=293.84s)]
*  Is that something you're considering more? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=296.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=299.2s)]
*  He's killing a lot of people. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=300.8s)]
*  I don't know what's wrong with him. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  What the hell happened to him, right? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  He's killing a lot of people. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=306.0s)]
*  I'm not happy about that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=307.2s)]
*  Go ahead, what else? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=309.12s)]
*  Then a reporter asks Trump additional questions about Putin. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=310.0s)]
*  And then Trump's response was to basically finish a sentence by saying, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=314.56s)]
*  why the hell would I tell you what I'm going to do? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=318.88s)]
*  You're fake news, aren't you? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=321.04s)]
*  You're fake news. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=322.48s)]
*  And again, it's just so embarrassing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=323.36s)]
*  You're fake news. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=324.72s)]
*  Why would I tell the fake news? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=325.68s)]
*  Dude, what the hell are you talking about? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  Here, play this clip right here. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=328.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'll give you an update. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=330.32s)]
*  I'm not happy with what Putin's doing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=331.28s)]
*  He's killing a lot of people. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=333.52s)]
*  And I don't know what the hell happened to Putin. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=334.88s)]
*  I've known him a long time. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=336.88s)]
*  Always gotten along with him. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=338.64s)]
*  But he's sending rockets into cities and killing people. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  And I don't like it at all. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=343.76s)]
*  Okay? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=345.67999999999995s)]
*  We're in the middle of talking and he's shooting rockets into Kiev and other cities. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=346.79999999999995s)]
*  I don't like it at all. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  President, what do you want to do about that? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm surprised. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=354.64s)]
*  I'm very surprised. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  We'll see what we're going to do. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  What am I going to tell you? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=357.76s)]
*  You're the fake news, aren't you? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=359.44s)]
*  You're totally fake. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=360.96s)]
*  All right, any other questions? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=362.32s)]
*  I don't like what Putin is doing. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=363.84s)]
*  Not even a little bit. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=365.52s)]
*  He's killing people. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  And something happened to this guy and I don't like it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  And as Donald Trump's being asked these questions by reporters in Morristown, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  New Jersey on this landing strip or tarmac, wherever the heck he is, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=376.96s)]
*  he was told that Pete Hegseth, Department of Defense's interim chief of staff, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=382.79999999999995s)]
*  worked in the Biden administration as a holdover who was critical of Trump. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=388.16s)]
*  And it was like the first time Trump heard that he's like, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=392.56s)]
*  that's very bad. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=395.04s)]
*  I'm going to have to do something about that. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth's acting chief of staff is a Biden administration holdover [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=397.52000000000004s)]
*  who has said some very critical things about you and Vice President Pence. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=403.12s)]
*  Do you have any thoughts on that? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=406.8s)]
*  Who is the chief of staff? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=408.48s)]
*  President Correa. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=409.92s)]
*  I have no idea who he is, but if he did say that, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=411.44000000000005s)]
*  I would recommend that we don't take him. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=413.76000000000005s)]
*  I mean, if he did say something like that, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=416.24s)]
*  I would recommend we don't take him. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=419.04s)]
*  But let's see, I'll take a look. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=420.64s)]
*  Correa, I'll check it out. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=422.64s)]
*  Do you even know who's working for you, Donald? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=424.48s)]
*  Like, do you know at all what's going on? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=426.88s)]
*  Do you know what's signing? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=429.44s)]
*  It's always projection and confession with the Trump regime and these magas though, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=431.04s)]
*  you know, isn't it? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=435.36s)]
*  So like when they accuse former President Biden of like, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=436.4s)]
*  you didn't do anything, it was just the auto pen that did anything. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=439.68s)]
*  Like, you know, they're telling on themselves [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=443.52s)]
*  because who the hell makes up something like that? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=445.12s)]
*  The auto pen. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=446.96s)]
*  Here's what I know under former President Biden. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=448.08s)]
*  We had a stable, predictable, values-based government. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=450.24s)]
*  Two new nations joined NATO. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=454.32s)]
*  Our international standing was never more powerful than it was under former President Biden. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=456.16s)]
*  Domestically, we had GDP growth that was number one across the world. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=462.24s)]
*  We had inflation under control such that the Fed was reducing interest rates. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=468.08s)]
*  We had record job growth, 16.2 million jobs created. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=473.2s)]
*  Record low unemployment. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=476.96s)]
*  We were energy independent, producing the most energy anywhere in the world. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  40,000 infrastructure projects were going up across the country. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=482.08s)]
*  So that's what I do know about what actually was transpiring under the Biden administration. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=486.64s)]
*  And here, Donald Trump, whose whole thing is what? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=492.8s)]
*  America, America. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, he's approving the deal now with Nippon Steel in Japan to take over U.S. Steel. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=496.64s)]
*  But see, Trump's such an idiot that he thinks he did the deal with Nissan, not Nippon. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=503.44s)]
*  He goes, Nissan is a great company. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=508.88s)]
*  Nippon, it's Nippon, not Nissan, you idiot. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=514.64s)]
*  Otherwise, I wouldn't make the deal. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=526.64s)]
*  I went to the unions, to the all of the local unions. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=528.4799999999999s)]
*  They all wanted it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  And I'm doing it because all of the congressmen came in, about five of them. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=533.04s)]
*  And the others, I understand, are in conference. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=538.56s)]
*  And they asked that I do it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  Everybody seems to want it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=543.1999999999999s)]
*  And we'll see. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=545.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you know, we'll see what the final is. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=545.8399999999999s)]
*  But they're going to invest billions of dollars in steel. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=548.8s)]
*  And it's a good company. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=552.0799999999999s)]
*  Nissan's a very good company. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=554.88s)]
*  But it's an investment and it's a partial ownership. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=555.84s)]
*  But it'll be controlled by the USA. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=559.12s)]
*  Now, I played the clips of Donald Trump's disastrous speech before West Point, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=561.2s)]
*  before the United States Army grads, over and over again. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=567.36s)]
*  So I'm not going to play it again here. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  But it was like when Donald Trump said that he gave a great commencement speech [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=571.92s)]
*  at the Ohio State University, when he gave the speech at Alabama. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=576.0s)]
*  Not to mention Donald Trump talking about trophy wives in front of the Army grads [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=580.88s)]
*  and that he doesn't like stealth because Trump literally thinks that stealth planes are invisible. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=586.56s)]
*  And he says, I could still see them even though they have the funny shapes. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=592.24s)]
*  And that's a pretty problematic thing for a commander-in-chief to say. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=596.24s)]
*  He also attacked Obama and Biden, which was disgraceful. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=600.88s)]
*  He attacked the transgender community, which was disgraceful. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=605.36s)]
*  It was just an overall. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=609.12s)]
*  He compared himself to Al Capone. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=611.12s)]
*  Just bizarre stuff. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=614.48s)]
*  I mean, like here while Donald Trump is answering questions too, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=615.44s)]
*  you'll see again that he believes that one of the big problems with Harvard [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=620.5600000000001s)]
*  is like he's learning for the first time that they have international students. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  Donald, there's so many schools that have international students. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=631.7600000000001s)]
*  It's not just Harvard. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=635.2s)]
*  That's what upsets you about Harvard, that it has international students. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=637.36s)]
*  Then he demands the names. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=640.4s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=641.84s)]
*  Here was Donald Trump capitulating, saying that he would be not imposing the 50% tariffs on Europe [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=696.4s)]
*  conveniently as we head into the opening of the markets. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=718.72s)]
*  It's obviously Memorial Day, by the way. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=723.76s)]
*  Happy Memorial Day to everybody. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=726.8s)]
*  It's really a solemn day as well, where it's important that we remember all of [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=730.24s)]
*  the fallen soldiers who have sacrificed everything for us. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=736.24s)]
*  Here's the speech of Donald Trump at the EU. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=739.36s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=741.12s)]
*  I want to point out as well, the shipping situation from China to the US actually [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=784.16s)]
*  hasn't gotten all that much better since Trump rushed trade advisor Jameson Greer and [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=790.64s)]
*  Scott Bessent, his Treasury Secretary to cave to China. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=798.64s)]
*  Apollo says the following, it's been nearly two weeks since the China-US trade deal, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=802.24s)]
*  but container traffic from China to the US hasn't shown a strong rebound. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=807.12s)]
*  Are 30% tariffs on China still too high? Yes. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=811.68s)]
*  Or are US companies simply waiting to see if tariffs will drop further [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=814.88s)]
*  before ramping up shipments? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=818.8s)]
*  That's the problem with Trump's policies. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=820.4s)]
*  He's so malicious, arbitrary, and capricious that no one even knows what the hell he's [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=822.7199999999999s)]
*  even doing at any given point in time. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=827.76s)]
*  I always got to mention climate on these videos now because it's so important and I think it [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=832.0s)]
*  sometimes gets short shrift and not a lot of people talk about it. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=838.08s)]
*  But one of the things that Trump has directed his Justice Department to do is it's not good [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=842.1600000000001s)]
*  enough that the Trump EPA and the Trump agencies are trying to destroy the environment at the [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=847.76s)]
*  federal level. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=853.84s)]
*  They're having the Department of Justice sue the states that are trying to, as states' [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=855.2800000000001s)]
*  rights issues, help the environment in their states. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=861.76s)]
*  There's a lot of states that are saying, or we're going to make polluters basically reimburse [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=865.6s)]
*  the state for their stuff, Trump suing them. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=870.6400000000001s)]
*  Trump and the MAGA Republicans pushing forward legislation to try to block the emission [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=873.6800000000001s)]
*  standards that California sets. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=880.8000000000001s)]
*  And I live in California. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=882.5600000000001s)]
*  What, 30 years ago there was so much smog, it was gross. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=883.9200000000001s)]
*  We got that under control in California, but Trump wants to bring back the smog [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=887.6s)]
*  because it's an absolute death cult. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=891.84s)]
*  There's nothing else to really say about it. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=893.84s)]
*  There you have it right there again. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=897.6s)]
*  He caves. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=899.12s)]
*  He's a loser. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=900.0s)]
*  Weak, pathetic. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=901.2800000000001s)]
*  You can see it just all play out there, I think. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=903.0400000000001s)]
*  It's just the behavior of a loser. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=907.0400000000001s)]
*  And it's humiliating to the United States. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=910.32s)]
*  Tell me what you think. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=913.0400000000001s)]

*  Thanks so much for watching and have a restful Memorial Day. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=917.2s)]
*  But remember what the Memorial Day is all about. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=920.64s)]
*  It's about remembering the troops who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YtHLmd3A&t=922.8s)]
