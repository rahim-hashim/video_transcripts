# YIKES! Trump makes SHOCKING  BLUNDER in Negotiation
**MeidasTouch:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM)
*  There's a reason that they called Donald Trump no deals Donald or some people refer to him as a taco [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump always chicken outs that doesn't just apply to his trade policy [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=7.8s)]
*  It applies to his foreign policy in general as well and you see the chaotic [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=13.36s)]
*  incoherent policies of Trump at play with his [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=20.12s)]
*  negotiations between the United States and Iran [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=24.0s)]
*  Where Iran is like totally punking him and they're saying we have no clue [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=27.72s)]
*  What the United States is even proposing and they're constantly changing things and then you have Donald Trump caving and like [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=33.1s)]
*  giving up [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=41.12s)]
*  key negotiating points in order just to try to make a deal and then he tries to like pull those terms back via [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=42.62s)]
*  Social media posts like let me try to break down what's going on with Donald Trump's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=50.919999999999995s)]
*  Negotiations with Iran. Let me bring some receipts as well [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  So the headline Trump caves US nuclear deal with Iran being proposed by the Trump regime [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=61.32s)]
*  It allows Iran to enrich uranium [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=69.44s)]
*  Which was a bright line that Donald Trump and all these MAGA Republicans said that they were never going to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  That they would never cross right when Donald Trump's been attacking [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=79.44s)]
*  former President Obama's deal with Iran which was known as the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=83.88s)]
*  JCPOA the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=89.32s)]
*  It was with the United States United Kingdom France China Russia and Germany along with Iran [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=93.44s)]
*  Yes, you see Obama brought in all these other countries into the deal the part that Trump and all of the MAGA Republicans [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=99.88s)]
*  Attacked Obama for was you're still allowing some uranium enrichment to take place [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  And if you allow some Iran's gonna run with it and basically void the deal [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=113.72s)]
*  one of the other aspects that former President Obama was attacked by Donald Trump and others for saying that the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=119.88s)]
*  Monitoring and verification process was not strong and robust enough [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=127.28s)]
*  Trump pulled the United during his first term pulled the United States out of the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  deal with Iran to stop Iran from having nuclear weapons and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=138.2s)]
*  Basically what Donald Trump would at least it's been reported that that Donald Trump's regime has been proposing to Iran is a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=143.04s)]
*  weaker more watered-down version of the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=151.12s)]
*  Obama deal with Iran that all of the MAGA Republicans were saying it's the worst thing ever and it would allow [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=154.76s)]
*  Iran to continue enriching uranium [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=161.44s)]
*  So then Donald Trump had to come out with a post with exclamation points saying absolutely not [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=164.24s)]
*  We will never allow them to enrich uranium and it just goes back to this whole idea of this chaos [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=169.72s)]
*  Like who's running this who who are who's negotiating these deals? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  Who knows what the hell is going on? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=180.72s)]
*  Because with all of these things what we hear time and time again from other countries whether it's Japan whether it's India [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=183.16s)]
*  Whether it's the European Union is they have no clue [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=190.04s)]
*  What Trump is even asking for like what the negotiations are even about because it's just constantly [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  Changing over and over again [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=202.84s)]
*  So at first Axios got the scoop that this US nuclear deal with Iran [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=204.64s)]
*  Allows Iran to enrich uranium at low levels and doesn't include the full [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=209.84s)]
*  Dismantlement of the nuclear facilities which all the Republicans said that Trump was definitely gonna get that there would be no more [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=216.0s)]
*  enrichment at all as our editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski says [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  This combined with a Reuters report that Iran was about to reject Trump's previous proposal [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  Indicates that taco Trump has made an appearance at the Iran nuke talks and he is caving [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=234.44s)]
*  Just go through this Axios article which lists the terms of this deal with Iran for a moment [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=240.8s)]
*  The nuclear deal proposal the US gave Iran over the weekend would allow limited low-level [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=248.52s)]
*  Uranium enrichment on Iranian soil for a to be determined period of time Axios has learned [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=254.44s)]
*  Steve Witkoff and Marco Rubio were allegedly involved in these [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=261.24s)]
*  discussions it goes on to talk about how [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=266.32s)]
*  Iran won't be allowed to develop domestic enrichment capabilities beyond those necessary for civilian purposes [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=270.52s)]
*  After signing the agreement Iran will have to temporarily reduce its enrichment concentration to 3% [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  This period will be agreed upon in negotiations Iran's underground enrichment facilities will have to become non-operational [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=283.35999999999996s)]
*  According to the proposal the agreement will establish a strong system for monitoring and verification [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=291.52s)]
*  including immediate approval of the IAEA's [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=298.64s)]
*  Additional protocol and again you just compare this to former President Obama's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=303.44s)]
*  JCPOA and what I just read for you is a more watered-down version in the JCPOA [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=310.56s)]
*  Iran committed to robust inspections by the IAEA [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=317.76s)]
*  including access to declared nuclear facilities and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=322.6s)]
*  supply chains so [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=327.28s)]
*  What did Donald Trump do after this news broke Donald Trump then started posting? No, you're wrong [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm not supportive of this his post is the auto pen should have stopped Iran a long time ago from quote [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=335.28s)]
*  Enriching under our potential agreement. We will not allow any enrichment of uranium and he puts that all in caps [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=342.8s)]
*  So then Iranian officials are saying the nuclear proposal by the US is quote [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=351.2s)]
*  incoherent and disjointed as sources warn talks momentum is [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=357.48s)]
*  collapsing and the this is how Iran basically [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=362.8s)]
*  Characterizes things they go [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=367.8s)]
*  The fact that the Americans constantly change their positions [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=370.32s)]
*  Has so far been the main obstacle to the success of the talks and now makes the work more difficult than ever [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=374.88s)]
*  The text is clearly in conflict with the latest agreement reached during the fifth round of [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=382.76s)]
*  Negotiations is what this Iranian official says you keep on changing the terms [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=388.72s)]
*  We don't know what you're even asking for at this time as this one account says Trump walked away from the Obama Iran [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=393.04s)]
*  Deal and his deal is gonna be slightly worse [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=400.84s)]
*  And so is MAGA gonna praise him now as a great dealmaker for just doing Obama's deal [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=403.44s)]
*  But a worse deal and then congressmember Eric Swalwell says I love that Trump is going copy and paste on [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=408.58s)]
*  Obama's Iran nuclear deal which Trump backed out of during his first term [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  This account right here at the main wonk love this guy's work [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  He says good outline of Trump's Iran proposal as [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  Reported and comparing it to Obama. It's quite literally Obama's Iran nuke deal the JCPOA [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=430.52000000000004s)]
*  Except the JCPOA was stronger when it came to enforcement mechanisms [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=438.32s)]
*  Now the leader of Iran Ayatollah Khomeini had been posting a lot about Donald Trump not being a serious [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=444.20000000000005s)]
*  Negotiator and basically mocking Donald Trump on social media Ayatollah Khomeini on May 17 [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=452.32s)]
*  2025 says Trump said he wants to use power for peace [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=460.44s)]
*  He's lying some of the remarks made during the US president's trip to the region. That's when Trump went to Qatar [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=463.94s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and UAE some of the remarks made during Trump's trip to the region aren't even worth the response at all [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=471.15999999999997s)]
*  Khomeini says the level of those remarks is so low that they are a source of shame for the American nation [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=478.44s)]
*  Then on May 20th, 2025 Ayatollah Khomeini writes [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  In degree he goes the reason the US insists so much on direct [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=489.96s)]
*  Negotiations is to claim that they've been able to bring Iran to the negotiating table using threats [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=495.16s)]
*  Inducements and tricks we won't allow that then he says indirect negotiations took place [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=501.64s)]
*  Needless to say there was no result. We don't think these negotiations will yield results now either [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=507.6s)]
*  We don't know what will happen. That's May 20th, 2025 [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=514.08s)]
*  He also writes for the Americans to say we won't allow Iran to enrich uranium is utter nonsense [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=517.8000000000001s)]
*  We aren't waiting for anyone's permission [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=523.2s)]
*  The Islamic Republic has certain policies and it will pursue them [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=525.96s)]
*  I'd like to give a reminder to the other side the Americans who are talking in these indirect [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=530.0s)]
*  Negotiations should avoid talking nonsense for them to say we won't allow Iran to enrich uranium is utter [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=535.48s)]
*  Nonsense and so what we saw was Iran pulling out of the nuclear discussions Trump desperately trying to make a deal [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=543.72s)]
*  He's been saying I want to make a deal. I got to make a deal [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=551.88s)]
*  So then obviously a deal was proposed to Iran which allowed nuclear [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=554.54s)]
*  uranium enrichment [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=560.56s)]
*  From Iran and then once that was reported that Donald Trump was a taco [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=562.16s)]
*  Trump always chickens out and that Trump is caving Trump then goes on the truth social his social media platform and [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=567.6s)]
*  Says we will not allow them to enrich uranium and this is just what we see over and over again with Donald Trump [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=574.8s)]
*  Hey Midas mighty so I used to have no clue what to get my mom for Mother's Day [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=581.8399999999999s)]

*  Quince.com slash Midas. Let me share this with you Maga Republican Senator Tom Cotton [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=691.32s)]
*  Here he is back on May 8th and here he talks about look Trump's gonna do a strong deal [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=697.8000000000001s)]
*  He's not gonna allow Iran to enrich uranium [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=703.7600000000001s)]
*  But the deal that Trump was gonna do before he just got mocked for it would have allowed Iran to enrich uranium [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=707.34s)]
*  Here's what Tom Cotton said play this clip [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=713.84s)]
*  Well Brian president Trump has been very clear about this for 10 years since he first entered politics [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=715.8800000000001s)]
*  Iran can never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=719.92s)]
*  This is the seventh anniversary of one of the best and most important decisions president Trump made in his first term [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=722.0s)]
*  Which is to withdraw the United States from the disastrous Obama nuclear deal [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=727.5999999999999s)]
*  Now he's trying to get a better deal the deal as he said over the weekend [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=732.28s)]
*  Which is the total dismantlement of their nuclear program? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=734.9599999999999s)]
*  There's no reason for Iran to enrich uranium as secretary Rubio has said if they enrich to the lowest levels [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=738.06s)]
*  They can enrich the highest levels so they have to totally [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=744.0s)]
*  Dismantle their program and President Trump has been very clear. He's willing to sit down [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=747.1600000000001s)]
*  He's willing to get a good strong deal [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=751.0400000000001s)]
*  But he's also not gonna let the Iranians tap him along as they continue to have rich uranium and get closer to a bomb [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=753.2800000000001s)]
*  Now here's what Maga Republican Senator Ted Cruz had to say also play this clip [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=759.2800000000001s)]
*  I gotta say mark that there's a real contrast [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=764.72s)]
*  between the strength that President Trump has shown with respect to Iran and [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=767.6s)]
*  The weakness and appeasement that Joe Biden showed for four years the first term President Trump took on Iran directly [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=772.0s)]
*  Pulled out of the disastrous Obama Iran nuclear deal. He ended the civilian nuclear waivers [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=779.8s)]
*  He ended the oil waivers and the result [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=787.14s)]
*  Maximum pressure put the Iranian economy into freefall [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=790.8s)]
*  Their oil sales fell from a million barrels a day of oil down all the way down to [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=795.26s)]
*  300,000 barrels of oil now, I want to show you how [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=801.82s)]
*  Thirsty how weak and pathetic in my opinion Donald Trump look so back on May 15th [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=805.86s)]
*  2025 when Donald Trump was in the Middle East [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=813.3000000000001s)]
*  He said that he thinks the US is close to doing a nuclear deal with Iran [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=816.0600000000001s)]
*  He said we're very close to getting this deal done and it's basically about to happen [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=820.86s)]
*  Remember when he said this play this clip and you probably read today the story about [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=825.94s)]
*  Iran is sort of agreed to the terms [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=830.34s)]
*  They're not gonna make out. I call it in a friendly way nuclear dust. We're not gonna be making any nuclear dust in Iran and [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=834.38s)]
*  We've been strong. I want them to succeed. I want them to end up being a great country [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=842.74s)]
*  Frankly, but they can't have a nuclear weapon. That's the only thing it's very simple [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=847.74s)]
*  It's not like I have to give you 30 pages worth of details. There's only one sentence [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=851.2s)]
*  They can't have a nuclear weapon and then at that same trip. He's like I really want to make a deal with Iran [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=855.82s)]
*  I really want to make a deal with them [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=861.82s)]
*  But do you see how weak this is that he's projecting here? He touts what he's doing here play this clip [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=864.14s)]
*  I want to make a deal with Iran. I want to do something if it's possible [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=870.14s)]
*  But for that to happen it must stop sponsoring terror halt its bloody proxy wars and [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=873.9399999999999s)]
*  Permanently and verifiably cease its pursuit of nuclear weapons. They cannot have a nuclear weapon [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=879.98s)]
*  I don't imagine is anybody at this table or anybody in this room that would say they can [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=885.68s)]
*  I'm strongly urging all nations to join us in fully and totally enforcing the sanctions that I just placed on Iran and [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=891.18s)]
*  We also place secondary sanctions which are in certain ways even more devastating [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=900.1s)]
*  Iran as you know had no money when I [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=905.9000000000001s)]
*  Left office they were broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=908.62s)]
*  There was no attack. There was no thought of attack. There would have been no attack of our president now about seven years ago or so [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=914.6600000000001s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump said when he [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=921.22s)]
*  Terminated Obama's deal with Iran here play this clip the so-called Iran deal [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=925.14s)]
*  We're supposed to protect the United States and our allies from the lunacy of an Iranian nuclear bomb a [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=930.26s)]
*  Weapon that will only endanger the survival of the Iranian regime [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=937.78s)]
*  in fact the deal allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium and over time [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=944.5s)]
*  Reach the brink of a nuclear breakout. So when you put all of this together [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=951.9599999999999s)]
*  It's a microcosm. I think of just the larger issue here and we're seeing it [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=958.16s)]
*  It's not just like taco Trump always chickens out. It's not just that he caves [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=963.48s)]
*  It truly is that it is incoherent [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=969.4s)]
*  What they are asking for and because they constantly change [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=973.4s)]
*  What their views and opinions are based on Donald Trump waking up and making a social media post [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=978.4s)]
*  There's very little clarity out there and that's what we've heard time and time again in all of these trade negotiations [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=984.8s)]
*  which is [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=991.92s)]
*  What are the terms that the US is agreeable to or not agreeable to and then? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=993.3199999999999s)]
*  Will the US abide by those terms or they just making it up and and are they changing it and I? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=999.52s)]
*  Read from you Ayatollah Khomeini's post where he's saying that they're not going to give up enriching uranium [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=1005.88s)]
*  So if they're not gonna give up enriching uranium and even though Trump seemed to be okay with them [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=1013.72s)]
*  Agreeing to enrich a small amount of uranium for civilian use but now Trump's saying he's not for that [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=1019.88s)]
*  What the hell is happening? And I think it's also important to note one of the things that was said there though [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=1025.84s)]
*  Is that see Trump just wants us [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=1032.16s)]
*  Iran negotiations one-on-one you see former President Obama was smart and he said [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=1035.88s)]
*  US can't do this alone if you actually want to enforce it [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=1041.96s)]
*  So that's why Obama brought in all these other countries to the table China [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=1045.4s)]
*  United Kingdom France Russia Germany back in 2015 in order to have a coalition if you will [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=1050.8000000000002s)]
*  Oversee this versus you know I think just doing it one-on-one is probably very difficult [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=1059.2s)]
*  But Trump's isolated the US from everybody at this point so [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrESzyezYM&t=1064.84s)]
