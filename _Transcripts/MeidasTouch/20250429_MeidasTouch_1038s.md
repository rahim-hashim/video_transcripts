*  It's time for us to be done with optimism about their motives or their objectives [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=30.0s)]
*  Time to stop wondering if you can trust the nuclear codes to people who don't know how to organize a group chat [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=35.4s)]
*  It's time to stop ignoring the hypocrisy and wearing a big gold cross while announcing the defunding of children's cancer research [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=43.56s)]
*  And time to stop thinking that we can reason or negotiate with a madman [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Time to stop apologizing when we were not wrong [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=58.0s)]

*  Our federal workers don't deserve to have well a 19 year old doge bro called big balls [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=87.63999999999999s)]

*  Autistic kids and adults who are loving contributors to our society don't deserve to be [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=97.8s)]
*  Stigmatized by a weird nepo baby who once stashed the dead bear in the backseat of his car [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=105.8s)]
*  Our [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=117.32s)]
*  Military service members don't deserve to be told by a washed-up [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=128.04s)]
*  Fox TV commentator who drank too much and committed sexual assault before being appointed Secretary of Defense [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=131.44s)]
*  That they can't serve their country simply because they're black or gay or a woman [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  And [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=148.2s)]
*  If it sounds like I'm becoming contemptuous of Donald Trump and the people that he has elevated it's because I am [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=149.72s)]
*  You should be too [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=159.92s)]

*  Next up governor Pritzker talks about how all of these Trump lackeys these Trump minions the Trump cabinet [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=167.88s)]
*  They are failures as human beings. They are failures in life and they are dangerous individuals here play this clip [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=176.24s)]
*  But because of Donald Trump's xenophobia, we've seen foreign students [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=185.04s)]
*  Already choosing not to attend our universities and being told to leave [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  Businesses from overseas are afraid to invest their money here and to bring their executives to our shores [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=196.52s)]

*  already in just 100 days if [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  The best in the brightest around the world no longer flock to this shining city on a hill [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=211.6s)]
*  Then the US economy is likely to fail [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  But failure [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=222.04s)]
*  It's starting to look like that's the point of all this doesn't it? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=224.04s)]
*  We have a secretary of education who hates teachers and schools [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=227.16s)]
*  We have a secretary of transportation who hates public transit [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=233.44s)]
*  We have an attorney general who hates the Constitution [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=237.68s)]
*  We have a secretary of state the son of naturalized citizens a family of refugees [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=242.2s)]
*  on a crusade to expel our country of both [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=248.44s)]
*  We have a head of the Department of Government Efficiency an [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=251.48s)]
*  immigrant [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=256.76s)]
*  granted the privilege of living and working here a man who has made hundreds of billions of dollars after [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=258.12s)]
*  The government rescued his business for him who is looking to destroy the American middle class to fund tax cuts for himself [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  And we have a president who claims to love America [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=275.36s)]
*  But who hates our military so much that he calls them losers and suckers [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=278.4s)]
*  And who can't be bothered to delay his golf game to greet the bodies of four fallen US soldiers [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=283.12s)]
*  And we have a grand old party [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  Founded by one of our nation's bravest presidents Abraham Lincoln who today would be a Democrat I might add [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=296.96s)]
*  But a grand old party so afraid of the felon and the fraud that they put into the White House [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=303.8s)]
*  That they would sooner watch him destroy our country than lift a hand to save it [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  Democrats [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=315.04s)]
*  We may have to fix our messaging and our strategy [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=316.32000000000005s)]
*  But our values are exactly where they ought to be and we will never join so many [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=318.8s)]
*  Republicans in the special place in hell reserved for quizlings and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=324.12s)]
*  Cowards [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=328.84s)]
*  I [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=337.92s)]
*  Love that portion of the speech next up governor Pritzker talks about his own background as a [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=339.12s)]
*  Ukrainian American Jew he says who helped build the Holocaust [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=345.32s)]
*  Museum and he talks about the fact that he was a great man [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=350.64s)]
*  He says who helped build the Holocaust Museum and he talks about how these [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=354.32000000000005s)]
*  Magarepublicans are trying to you know weaponize the idea of anti-semitism in order to enact their [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=360.72s)]
*  Authoritarian agenda he goes don't invoke [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=369.04s)]
*  anti-semitism as a way to start snatching migrants off the street and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=372.72s)]
*  Engaging in authoritarian tactics he goes. How dare you play this clip? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  And there are plenty of people in this country who hold opinions that I find abhorrent [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=385.16s)]
*  But my faith and our Constitution dictate that I fight for their freedoms as loudly as I defend my own [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=391.04s)]
*  And [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=404.0s)]
*  As a Ukrainian American Jew who built a Holocaust Museum [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=404.88s)]
*  Whose family immigrated here as refugees from the Russian pogroms [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=409.88s)]
*  Let me say this to Donald Trump stop tearing down the Constitution in the name of my ancestors [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=414.8s)]
*  Do not claim that your authoritarian power grabs are about combating anti-semitism [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=439.32s)]
*  When you destroy social justice you are disparaging the very foundation of Judaism [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  When the pendulum swings back and it always does [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=451.96s)]
*  You will have contributed to the climate of retribution that will inevitably follow and then governor Pritzker had a message to other [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  Democrats, let's watch this clip right here [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=464.84s)]
*  What I find ironic about the current conversation surrounding our party is that the voices flocking to podcasts and [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=467.08s)]
*  Cable news shows to admonish fellow Democrats for not caring enough about the struggles of working families [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=473.84s)]
*  Are the same ones who when it comes to relief of the struggles of real people have been timid not bold [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  They didn't want to fight the health insurance companies and the drug manufacturers [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=490.24s)]
*  They didn't want to demand an increase in the minimum wage or require paid family leave [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=494.48s)]
*  They gave in to the powerful hedge fund managers and tech bros whose blind pursuit of profits is now destroying [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=500.36s)]
*  Everything that matters [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=508.84000000000003s)]
*  And they gave in to the power of the family that is now in the hands of the rich [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=510.84000000000003s)]
*  The power of the family that is now destroying everything that matters to middle-class families [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=516.6400000000001s)]
*  From home ownership to health care to veterans benefits [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=522.36s)]
*  They told us to ignore the fact that most Americans can't afford a vacation while they're young or retirement once they're old [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=528.5200000000001s)]
*  Here's the problem with the do-nothing crowd now telling us what to do [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=540.12s)]
*  Well, they spent their years watching Republicans illegitimately pack the Supreme Court, take [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=544.28s)]
*  away voting rights from people of color, systematically chip away at the constitutional order, and [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=551.1s)]
*  all the while they offered in response a simple defense of norms and decorum and a blind hope [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=557.18s)]
*  that one day soon Republicans would wake up to find their better angels. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=564.3399999999999s)]
*  Well, that got us exactly where we are today. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=569.42s)]
*  So folks, the reckoning is here. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=574.3s)]
*  And now that this culture of timidity is on full display, those same do-nothing Democrats [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=586.62s)]
*  want to blame our losses on our defense of black people, of trans kids, of immigrants, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=592.5s)]
*  instead of their own lack of guts and gumption. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=598.74s)]
*  Governor Pritzker then talks about some simple truths. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=605.38s)]
*  Right versus wrong. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=609.0600000000001s)]
*  He goes, it is wrong to snatch human beings off the street and send them to concentration [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=610.42s)]
*  camps in El Salvador. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=616.96s)]
*  That's not due process. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=618.62s)]
*  That's not what our Constitution says. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=619.86s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=621.86s)]
*  It is wrong to snatch a person off the street and ship them to a foreign gulag with no chance [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=622.86s)]
*  to defend themselves in a court of law. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=629.62s)]
*  And I want to be clear. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=645.0600000000001s)]
*  This is not an argument about immigration. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=646.1800000000001s)]
*  This is an argument about the Constitution. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=649.48s)]
*  Remember, Trump just last week arrested and deported three children under eight years [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=652.58s)]
*  old, all U.S. citizens, all of them, one of them a four-year-old with stage four cancer. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=658.46s)]
*  Let that sink in. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=665.98s)]
*  We geek out for a minute on something. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=667.38s)]
*  I think it's going to be helpful for you. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=669.0600000000001s)]
*  It's called Fatty 15. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=670.38s)]
*  Its co-founder, Dr. Stephanie Van Watson, discovered C-15 as the first essential fatty [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=671.82s)]
*  acid to be found in 90 years while working with the U.S. Navy to improve the health and [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=676.84s)]
*  welfare of aging dolphins. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=682.06s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=683.9s)]
*  Essential nutrients keep our cells healthy, which keeps us healthy. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=685.3399999999999s)]
*  So if you want to get sciency about it, studies show that C-15, it works by strengthening [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=688.28s)]
*  our cells, improving our mitochondrial function, and protecting us against damaging free radicals. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=693.4599999999999s)]
*  So if you feel like, how could I stop aging faster, or I'm sleeping poorly, or feeling [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=699.64s)]
*  sluggish? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=705.02s)]
*  The bottom line is that many of us are deficient in C-15, which results in weaker cells, which [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=706.2199999999999s)]
*  results in those things. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=711.12s)]
*  So Fatty 15 is the science-fact award-winning vegan and pure C-15 supplement that steps [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=712.64s)]
*  in and helps. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=718.32s)]
*  It works in multiple ways. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=719.5600000000001s)]
*  It repairs age-related damage to cells. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=720.76s)]
*  It protects them from future breakdowns. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=723.6s)]
*  It boosts mitochondrial energy output and activates pathways in the body that help regulate [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=725.78s)]
*  sleep, mood, natural repair mechanisms that support our overall health. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=730.64s)]
*  So deeper sleep, smoother functioning joints, healthier hair, skin and nails, that's essential, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=734.08s)]
*  and the C-15 helps here, and Fatty 15 delivers. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=739.56s)]

*  Let me show you the powerful closing portion of this speech by Governor Pritzker. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=779.98s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=785.46s)]
*  I understand the tendency to give in to despair right now, but despair is an indulgence that [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=786.46s)]
*  we cannot afford in the times upon which history turns. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=790.82s)]
*  Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=795.94s)]
*  but I am now. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=802.7800000000001s)]
*  These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=818.24s)]
*  They have to understand that we will fight their cruelty with every megaphone and microphone [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=822.88s)]
*  that we have. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=827.74s)]
*  We must castigate them on the soapbox and then punish them at the ballot box. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=828.8s)]
*  They must feel in their bones that when we survive this shameful episode of American [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=834.8s)]
*  history with our democracy intact, because we have no alternative but to do just that, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=853.24s)]
*  we will relegate their portraits to the museum halls reserved for tyrants and traitors. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=859.88s)]
*  And when the courage of our civic leaders wavers, when they fail to stand up for our [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=871.04s)]
*  country in its moment of greatest need, then we should remind them that cowardice always [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=877.4s)]
*  comes at a cost. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=883.56s)]
*  In the world's most successful republic, no generation of Americans has escaped our [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=886.4s)]
*  true inheritance, the test that we are given that asks how hard we are willing to fight [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=892.1999999999999s)]
*  to keep our society free. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=897.86s)]
*  It was selfish to think that ours would be the first. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=899.9399999999999s)]
*  But the fact that we are still here debating the question tells me our predecessors never [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=903.78s)]
*  this test in the past, often in situations just as dire as the one in front of us. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=912.36s)]
*  Cowardice can be contagious, but so too can courage. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=920.0s)]
*  And courage born during times when complacency beckons like a siren call is the most important [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=924.64s)]
*  kind of all. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=931.76s)]
*  Just as the hope that we hold onto in the darkness shines with its own special light, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=933.6s)]
*  these days I cling to the courage and the hope demonstrated by Andy and Gavin and Lucy. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=939.92s)]
*  Courage and hope that risks limbs and livelihoods to go to the most visible place possible, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=947.52s)]
*  to wave a sign or to post an upside down flag and remind everyone that what we do and what [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=954.0799999999999s)]
*  we don't do matters. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=961.36s)]
*  So tonight I'm telling you what I'm willing to do, and that's fight for our democracy, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=964.42s)]
*  for our liberty, for the opportunity for all of our people to live lives that are meaningful [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=970.74s)]
*  and free. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=976.9799999999999s)]
*  And I see around me tonight a room full of people who are ready to do the same. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=978.18s)]
*  So I have one question for all of you, Granite Staters, are you ready for the fight? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=983.38s)]
*  For real, Granite Staters, are you ready for the fight? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=989.3s)]
*  Good night New Hampshire, God bless you and God bless these United States. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=994.8199999999999s)]
*  There you have it folks, again I think one of the most powerful political speeches we have covered [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=1003.14s)]
*  thus far on the Midas Touch Network, you tell me what you think about it in the comments below. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdzmkTu8VU&t=1010.34s)]
