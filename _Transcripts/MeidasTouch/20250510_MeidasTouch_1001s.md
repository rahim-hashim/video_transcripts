# Melania HUMILIATES Donald after GOING MISSING from WH
**MeidasTouch:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE)
*  So where is Melania? Well, we know she's selling meme coins, or I'm not sure if you can even call it that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=0.0s)]
*  We know her meme coin is absolutely tanking and it's lost over 82, 83% of its value. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=7.5s)]
*  We know she's selling a documentary of herself that no one wants to watch to Amazon for like $40 million. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=15.5s)]
*  Can you say quid pro quo Jeff Bezos? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=24.5s)]
*  But where is she? I mean, seriously, she did attend on Thursday a ceremony giving former first lady, the late Barbara Bush, a stamp. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=28.5s)]
*  More on that in a little bit. But that was one of, I would say, maybe four or five times we've actually seen Melania. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=40.5s)]
*  You know, the New York Times wrote this article, and this is what it's called, a most sensitive subject in the White House. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=50.5s)]
*  Where is Melania? I mean, she doesn't want to be anywhere near Donald Trump. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=58.5s)]
*  I mean, we've known that and we've reported that before. You know, it's funny. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=63.5s)]
*  In this article from the New York Times, they're like, you know, sources charitably say she's been at the White House about 14 times [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=67.5s)]
*  in the 100 plus days that Donald Trump's been in office charitably. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=76.5s)]
*  I think that probably means she's been there about four or five days. So like, where is she physically? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=81.5s)]
*  I think she's most frequently in New York, which Donald Trump calls a hellscape, and they love to attack New York. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=87.5s)]
*  And she's at the apartment there where Barron goes to school. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=96.5s)]
*  And then I think also she's at Mar-a-Lago, but she doesn't want to be anywhere near Donald unless she's making money and grifting [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=99.5s)]
*  or unless she's making a public appearance, like when she was at Pope Francis's funeral, which Donald Trump said, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=107.5s)]
*  Oh, that's such an incredible funeral, such a great time. And yeah, who calls it a great time? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=114.5s)]
*  Let me show you what went down first on Thursday, where she was at this Barbara Bush stamp ceremony [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=120.5s)]
*  that I think nobody wanted her to be at. I mean, here's what she said. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=127.5s)]
*  It's hard to even understand what she's saying, but here's what she said at this Barbara Bush ceremony. Play this clip. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=132.5s)]
*  The unveiling of this commemorative stamp honors Barbara Bush's contributions as First Lady and her enduring impact on our nation. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=138.5s)]
*  May this tribute inspire us to lead with compassion, act with strength, and uphold the values that direct us or us toward meaningful existence. Thank you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=148.5s)]
*  But as we go through the Melania appearances, if you will, it's about grifting. It's about making money for herself. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=161.5s)]
*  Take a look at the official Melania meme coin, dollar sign Smelania. That's what they call it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=168.5s)]
*  You see what that looks like right there with the green going all the way up and then crashing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=174.5s)]
*  Well, I guess you could say that that's what Donald Trump has turned the American economy into. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=179.5s)]
*  It's like a Smelania or dollar sign Trump meme coin. But there she is. The meme coins. Absolutely an utter disaster. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=184.5s)]
*  By the way, with Trump memes coin, I think there were like 50 wallets that made money in seven hundred and seventy six thousand that lost money, just literally screwing people over. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=193.5s)]
*  Then right here it says First Lady Melania Trump scores win for America's foster youth with 25 million dollar investment. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=203.5s)]
*  That was one of the PR scams they wanted to announce. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=213.5s)]
*  Funding is a game changer in providing young adults with access to short term housing assistance. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=217.5s)]
*  So I'm like, she secures an investment, 25 million dollars. That sounds like a lot of money. What are we talking about here? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=225.5s)]
*  So you got to go into the article and they're talking about that. They're acting like she secured this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=231.5s)]
*  Melania announced Friday that a 25 million dollar foster youth investment will be included in Trump's 2020 2026 2026 fiscal year budget. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=236.5s)]
*  The funds will go to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Foster Youth to Independence Program to support young people who are transitioning out of foster. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=248.5s)]
*  Let me be very clear. Way more money than 25 million dollars should be invested in HUD and specifically this program. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=257.5s)]
*  This is one of those examples where Melania is a scammer and Fox is a scammer and they treat us all like we're actually stupid. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=266.5s)]
*  Because if you actually look at the budget, 26 billion dollars with a B has been cut from HUD in their Section 8 housing portion alone. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=273.5s)]
*  Thirty three billion dollars total from HUD. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=287.5s)]
*  But when it comes from when it comes to rental assistance programs and just in general helping low income Americans and other and other low income Americans and foster care Americans, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=290.5s)]
*  just generally we're talking about 26.7 billion to 33 billion dollars in cuts and they're acting like 25 million dollars is somehow a win that Melania secured as though it's her money. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=301.5s)]
*  Don't they act like they act like this is their money. It's the taxpayer money. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=316.5s)]
*  And what you're actually doing in this budget is you're adding 120 billion dollars more to defend spending so you can have a trillion dollars. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=321.5s)]
*  You're adding 44 billion dollars to immigration crackdown so you can do publicity stunts and not actually do deportations with dignity or actually have a functioning immigration system. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=329.5s)]
*  But yes, 33 billion dollars cut from HHS, 12 billion from education funding, 15 billion dollar from infrastructure funding on climate change, 34 billion dollars from HUD. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=343.5s)]
*  And it's eviscerating HUD by over 40 percent. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=356.5s)]
*  So don't brag about like, you know, we should be thankful for what you're doing here. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=358.5s)]
*  This is what you're really doing, Melania, is while nobody sees you at the White House and you spent like four days there. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=364.5s)]
*  Here we have over here what Melania is doing. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=371.5s)]
*  She's selling necklaces for six hundred dollars and two hundred dollars. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=374.5s)]
*  That's what she is doing. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=378.5s)]
*  But may I bring some receipts, Melania, because first let me show you what you're complicit in. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=380.5s)]
*  This is Melania when Donald Trump was running the first time where she where she said that it was merely locker room talk when Donald Trump brags about sexually assaulting women, which Donald Trump was found liable for sexual assault as well. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=388.5s)]
*  Here's Melania. I don't feel bad for her. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=404.5s)]
*  She is a complicit actor in all of this here. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=407.5s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=409.5s)]
*  He described it as as locker room talk to you. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=410.5s)]
*  I mean, you sort of alluded to that as well. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=413.5s)]
*  Is that what it is to you? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=415.5s)]
*  Just locker room talk? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=416.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of a two teenage boys. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=417.5s)]
*  Actually, they should behave better. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=421.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=423.5s)]
*  US 59. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=424.5s)]
*  Correct. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=425.5s)]
*  And sometimes I said, I have two boys at home. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=426.5s)]
*  I have my young son and I have my husband. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=429.5s)]
*  So but I know how some men talk and that's that's how I saw it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=433.5s)]
*  Yes, I can't even begin to imagine all of the money that I've spent on skincare and beauty products over the years to battle issues like acne and damaged hair and eczema change in hair color, rashes, et cetera. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=443.5s)]
*  But I recently realized that I was completely overlooking the most fundamental step. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=455.5s)]
*  The water I shower in. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=460.5s)]

*  Jolie's filtered shower head is best in class for removing chlorine and heavy metals. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=469.5s)]

*  Get yours now. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=532.5s)]
*  So now let me pull out some receipts, shall I? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=534.5s)]
*  Let me introduce you to Natasha Stoynov, who alleges Donald Trump assaulted her. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=537.5s)]
*  My name is Natasha Stoynov. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=542.5s)]
*  In 2005, I went to interview Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=545.5s)]
*  At one point, Melania went upstairs to change her clothes for the next photo shoot. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=549.5s)]
*  And Trump said to me, I want to show you this beautiful painting, this beautiful room. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=553.5s)]
*  He leads me to this room, pushes me against the wall and starts kissing me forcefully. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=556.5s)]
*  I tried to push him, kept coming back at me. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=560.5s)]
*  I was in shock and smothered and he had his hands here, gets my shoulders. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=562.5s)]
*  I felt sick inside. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=566.5s)]
*  I felt horrified. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=568.5s)]
*  And thank goodness, a butler charges into the room. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=570.5s)]
*  Like many women, I blame myself. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=572.5s)]
*  So Trump turned to me and said, you know, we're going to have an affair, don't you? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=574.5s)]
*  And Melania was approaching. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=578.5s)]
*  I was horrified. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=580.5s)]
*  When the Access Hollywood tape came out and also stories of many other women, including E.J. Carroll, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=581.5s)]
*  I realized I was not to blame, that he was just a predator of women. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=585.5s)]
*  What could have happened if the butler had not come into the room? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=590.5s)]
*  Donald Trump is an adjudicated sexual assaulter. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=593.5s)]
*  Now let me introduce you to Jessica Leigh. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=596.5s)]
*  Who alleges that Donald Trump assaulted her. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=598.5s)]
*  1979, I had gotten on an airplane. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=600.5s)]
*  The stewardess said to me, would you like to come up to first class? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=603.5s)]
*  In the window seat was a gentleman said that his name was Donald Trump. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=606.5s)]
*  The airplane took off and all of a sudden, Donald Trump started groping me. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=610.5s)]
*  He was trying to kiss me and I'm trying to push him away. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=615.5s)]
*  He was basically overpowering me. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=619.5s)]
*  When he started putting his hand up my skirt, I got out of the seat and he started to push me. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=621.5s)]
*  I got out of the seat, grabbed my purse and went back to my original seat. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=626.5s)]
*  And I certainly was shook up by the whole thing. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=631.5s)]
*  Two years later, at this fundraiser, up comes Trump and his wife. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=634.5s)]
*  And he looked at me and he said, I remember you. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=639.5s)]
*  You're that cunt from the airplane. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=643.5s)]
*  Donald Trump views women as for his entertainment. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=646.5s)]
*  He is a serial predator. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=650.5s)]
*  He has said it point blank. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=652.5s)]
*  And he's done it and he will continue to do it. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=654.5s)]
*  Let me introduce you to Stormy Daniels. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=657.5s)]
*  Here's what she has to say. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=660.5s)]
*  Oh, is this the one? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=662.5s)]
*  It's another. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=666.5s)]
*  Let me introduce you to Karen McDougall. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=667.5s)]
*  Here's what she has to say. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=671.5s)]
*  You said you had had sex that first time. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=672.5s)]
*  All these times you saw him, this was an ongoing sexual relationship. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=674.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=678.5s)]
*  Can you estimate how many times you actually saw him? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=679.5s)]
*  I can tell you we saw each other a minimum five times a month, up to bigger numbers per month. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=681.5s)]
*  Over the course of how long? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=689.5s)]
*  We were together 10 months before I chose to end it. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=691.5s)]
*  So we saw each other quite frequently. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=693.5s)]
*  So dozens of times you were together. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=696.5s)]
*  Many dozens of times. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=698.5s)]
*  And you were intimate. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=699.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=700.5s)]
*  Many dozens of times. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=701.5s)]
*  Did he ever use protection? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=702.5s)]
*  No. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=704.5s)]
*  No, he didn't. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=705.5s)]
*  Was that something you thought about or it didn't concern you at the time? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=706.5s)]
*  You know, we talked about it right beforehand. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=713.5s)]
*  He was starting to and then he's like, I don't like these things. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=718.5s)]
*  And, you know, we discussed things. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=722.5s)]
*  Do you do blah, blah, blah. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=724.5s)]
*  We were just honest with each other and we didn't have sex. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=725.5s)]
*  And then he said, I don't like these things. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=728.5s)]
*  And then he said, I don't like these things. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=730.5s)]
*  We were just honest with each other and we didn't use any. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=732.5s)]
*  Now, Russia is enjoying all of this as part of their mockery of Donald Trump in the United States. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=735.5s)]
*  State regime media in Moscow has frequently been showing Melania nudes over and over again while their hosts mock Melania over and over again. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=743.5s)]
*  And they show all her photos from when she was a nude model. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=755.5s)]
*  That's what you want to call it. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=759.5s)]
*  Melania had previously posted. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=761.5s)]
*  Why do I stand proudly behind my nude modeling work? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=764.5s)]
*  And by the way, I showed you Karen McDougall. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=769.5s)]
*  There's Karen McDougall. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=772.5s)]
*  There's Ivanka. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=773.5s)]
*  There's Melania all standing there partying together. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=774.5s)]
*  That was shortly around the Epstein days for Donald when he would party with Epstein. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=777.5s)]
*  Right. It was right around that time period, a little later, I think, but in the in the late 90s. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=783.5s)]
*  And we all know how Melania met Donald Trump. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=787.5s)]
*  Of course, she was introduced by a guy named Paulo Zampoli, who now has some like ambassadorship. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=790.5s)]
*  Donald Trump appointed him to a big like ambassadorship role. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=796.5s)]
*  But he ran a modeling agency. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=800.5s)]
*  She was an Eastern European model. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=802.5s)]
*  He would have the model show up at these parties at the Kit Kat Club. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=804.5s)]
*  Wealthy Manhattan men would be invited in the 90s. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=808.5s)]
*  And that's how Melania ultimately met Donald through that. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=811.5s)]
*  Now, I had the opportunity to interview Stephanie Winston Wilcoff about all of this. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=817.5s)]
*  This was a little bit before the election. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=824.5s)]
*  But here, Stephanie Winston Wilcoff tells me what she thinks about all of this play, this clip. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=827.5s)]
*  Melania, I always say this. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=831.5s)]
*  Everything she does is intentional and every appearance she makes is something that, again, we let her she lets her clothing speak for herself. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=834.5s)]
*  You know, she does not plan on putting herself in a position where she's going to be the object of conversation unnecessarily. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=845.5s)]
*  I think Melania and Donald and I've said it all along, you know, it is the Mark Burnett rollout production show. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=855.5s)]
*  Their marriage was one made for both of them that put them both on the map. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=862.5s)]
*  And strategically, it made them both, you know, acceptable to millions of Americans homes that they were entering into with the apprentice. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=867.5s)]
*  So we have to roll back to really understand their relationship as to what legitimize their relationship, making her the supermodel and making him the businessman. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=877.5s)]
*  And now here we have a woman, a mother, a wife who has not been by her husband's side whatsoever. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=887.5s)]
*  And I would say several years ago, she would have been there more. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=894.5s)]
*  Now, after the conviction that Donald has just faced with the hush money criminal felony case in New York City, she's going to be around less and less. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=900.5s)]
*  He will continue to move forward. His base doesn't need her there. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=910.5s)]
*  Nor do they really, you know, would it really change the dial in whether or not they would consider him as their be all end all because they will. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=914.5s)]
*  But as far as Melania is concerned, she's going to keep her head low. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=923.5s)]
*  She's going to only do what she wants to do. But she and Donald, I do not believe, are ever, ever going to part ways. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=928.5s)]
*  You know, I wonder now when it comes to Melania, though, if one of the things she's nervous about is what happened to Donald Trump's first wife, Ivana. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=934.5s)]
*  Remember when the Daily Mail reported that Trump's wife, Ivana, first wife, Ivana, was buried in a cordon off grave in Bedminster that was barely visible in a completely overgrown area in the 506 acre golf course, apparently or allegedly. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=945.5s)]
*  So Donald Trump can get tax exemptions or tax write offs by turning the golf course into a cemetery in an area where he buried his first wife after she fell down stairs. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=963.5s)]
*  Anyway. OK. No, Melania. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=975.5s)]
*  I guess she's talking about stamps, who knows, grifting, losing money for people. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXhmwkiSRE&t=981.5s)]
