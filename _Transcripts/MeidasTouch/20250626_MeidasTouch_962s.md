# SICKLY Trump has DISASTER LANDING in US after NATO FAIL
**MeidasTouch:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U)
*  Hmm, disturbing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=0.0s)]
*  A very, very sickly looking Donald Trump returned from a disastrous trip to the NATO summit [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=1.0s)]
*  in the Netherlands at The Hague. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=7.32s)]
*  He was struggling to walk down the steps of Air Force One as he returned to the United [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=9.52s)]
*  States and then began ranting and raving like a lunatic over the leaks that the military [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=14.88s)]
*  strikes against Iran were not as successful as he claimed. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=20.68s)]
*  Let's take a look at him struggling to walk down a flight of steps from Air Force One. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=24.96s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=29.68s)]
*  While on Air Force One, Donald Trump was ranting and raving like a lunatic. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=30.68s)]
*  He was begging Israeli courts not to pursue cases against Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=42.62s)]
*  I'll show you those posts in a minute. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=48.96s)]
*  He was also attacking anyone who dare criticize the United States intelligence from the Pentagon [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=51.44s)]
*  and CENTCOM, which state that these strikes on the nuclear facilities in Iran were not [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=58.12s)]
*  as successful as Donald Trump claimed and that Iran would likely be able to continue [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  to build a nuclear program if it desired and that Iran was able to move the uranium out [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=68.52s)]
*  of the facilities in advance of the strikes based on Donald Trump's erratic behavior and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=75.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's constant posts. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=80.28s)]
*  It's unclear with this Trump regime. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=84.88s)]
*  There are supposed to be some briefing with the Congress over what took place, but apparently [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  the Trump regime is no longer allowing Tulsi Gabbard to be part of that anymore, specifically [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=94.64s)]
*  excluding their director of national intelligence from issues regarding national intelligence. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  Also the Trump regime is severely curtailing any of the classified information that Congress [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  will be able to look at. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=113.3s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=115.34s)]
*  Because they are hiding a lot of stuff. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=116.34s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump posted. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=119.86s)]
*  I'm not going to read the whole thing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=121.58s)]
*  I'll just give you a flavor of what a lunatic he is. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=122.86s)]
*  He goes, Secretary of Defense, war! [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=126.74s)]
*  Pete Hegseth together with military representatives will be holding a major news conference tomorrow [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=131.3s)]
*  morning. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=136.66s)]
*  It's happening already. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=137.66s)]
*  It's happened today at the Pentagon. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=138.66s)]
*  In order to fight for the dignity of our great American pilots, these patriots were very [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=141.54s)]
*  upset. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=146.42s)]
*  After 36 hours of dangerously flying through enemy territory, they landed. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=147.42s)]
*  They knew the success was legendary. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=152.38s)]
*  He puts that in caps. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=153.98s)]
*  And then two days later, they started reading fake news by CNN and the failing New York [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=155.66s)]
*  Times. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=160.26s)]
*  They felt terribly. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=161.26s)]
*  So in Donald Trump's unhinged, deranged, lunatic, fictitious world, the fighter pilots of B-2s [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=162.78s)]
*  are calling him up to complain and cry that they think the reporting by CNN and New York [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=170.5s)]
*  Times of the actual intelligence by the United States government shows that Iran's military [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=176.66s)]
*  or Iran's nuclear facilities were not destroyed and that now our fighter pilots are crying [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=185.38s)]
*  as a result. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=191.58s)]
*  So in Donald Trump's world, he's making the fighter pilots seem like they're whining when [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=192.96s)]
*  Donald Trump who's whining and using the fighter pilots as props to insulate the fact that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=198.04s)]
*  the mission was not achieved, that the mission was not successful and that Donald Trump talk [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=204.36s)]
*  owed. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=210.16s)]
*  I didn't want to see a war to begin with there. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=211.16s)]
*  But then after not completing the successful mission, Donald Trump then entered into a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=213.8s)]
*  ceasefire, which he claimed he was never going to do before. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=218.88s)]
*  He said he would never enter a ceasefire. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=222.2s)]
*  Remember what he said? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  He said that he wanted total denuclearization and that would be the total surrender of Iran. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=225.6s)]
*  Well, that didn't happen. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=231.68s)]
*  But when Donald Trump was in the Hague, when he was at the NATO summit, all he seemed to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=232.68s)]
*  be doing was praising Iran. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=237.6s)]
*  And he was so excited about Iran doing a trade deal with China. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=241.24s)]
*  First let me show you this clip where Donald Trump talks about how brave and heroic the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=246.4s)]
*  Iranians were and how he said it was very nice that the Iranians hit the American military [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=251.08s)]
*  base in Qatar and how they planned it together and just how nice the Iranians are. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=257.40000000000003s)]
*  Here's what he says. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=262.6s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=263.6s)]
*  You saw that where 14 missiles were shot at us the other day and they were very nice. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=264.6s)]
*  They gave us warning. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=271.0s)]
*  They said we're going to shoot them. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=272.0s)]
*  Is one o'clock okay? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=273.48s)]
*  They said it's fine. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=274.48s)]
*  And everybody was emptied off the base so they couldn't get hurt except for the gunners. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=277.72s)]
*  They call them the gunners. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=282.32s)]
*  And out of 14 high-end missiles that were shot at the base in Qatar, all 14, as you [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=284.92s)]
*  know, were shot down by our equipment. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=292.24s)]
*  Amazing stuff. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=295.08s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=296.08s)]
*  That they can do. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=297.08s)]
*  It's like shooting a bullet with a bullet. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=298.08s)]
*  It's the same thing if you think about it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=300.14s)]
*  14 out of 14 and they were, they weren't even that surprised. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=302.32s)]
*  They said, you do that well often? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=306.64s)]
*  They say we pretty much do, sir. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=309.64s)]
*  Now here's the clip of Donald Trump saying that he's really happy and he really encouraged [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=311.56s)]
*  Iran to sell its oil to China. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=319.0s)]
*  This is going to be great for Iran. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=322.52s)]
*  It's going to be great for China, Donald Trump says. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=324.12s)]
*  And it's really his honor to make this deal between Iran and China. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=326.76s)]
*  And I'm watching this. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=330.56s)]
*  I'm like, what the heck? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=331.56s)]
*  You're playing this clip. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=332.56s)]
*  Yesterday, you said China can now continue to purchase oil from Iran. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=333.64s)]
*  Are you giving up on your maximum pressure campaign? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=339.24s)]
*  Because there are sanctions right now. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=342.32s)]
*  With who? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=344.48s)]
*  On Iran? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=345.48s)]
*  No, look, they just had a war. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=346.48s)]
*  The war was fought. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  They fought it bravely. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=349.92s)]
*  I'm not giving up. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=350.92s)]
*  They're in the oil business. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=352.92s)]
*  I mean, I could stop it if I wanted. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=353.92s)]
*  I could sell China the oil myself. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=356.24s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=358.2s)]
*  They're going to need money to put that country back into shape. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=359.72s)]
*  We want to see that happen. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=362.4s)]
*  No, if they're going to sell oil, they're going to sell oil. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=363.76s)]
*  We're not taking over the oil. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=367.64s)]
*  We could have, you know. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=368.96s)]
*  I used to say with Iraq, keep the oil. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=369.96s)]
*  I could say it here, too. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=371.67999999999995s)]
*  We could have kept the oil. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=372.76s)]
*  No, China is going to want to buy oil. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=374.32s)]
*  They can buy it from us. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  They can buy it from other people. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=378.76s)]
*  But you're going to have to put that country back into shape. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=381.0s)]
*  It desperately needs money. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=383.56s)]
*  So then Donald Trump posted this. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  Again, I'm not going to read the entire thing, but here's what he says about the Prime Minister [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=386.67999999999995s)]
*  of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=392.24s)]
*  He goes, Breaking news. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=393.48s)]
*  I was shocked to hear that the state of Israel, which has just had one of its greatest moments [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=395.0s)]
*  in history and is strongly led by Bibi Netanyahu, is continuing its ridiculous witch hunt against [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=399.6s)]
*  their great wartime Prime Minister Bibi. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=406.2s)]
*  And I just went through hell together fighting a very tough and brilliant long time enemy [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=409.08000000000004s)]
*  of Israel, Iran. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=413.76s)]
*  And Bibi could not have been better, sharper, or stronger in his love of the incredible [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  Holy Land. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  Anybody else would have suffered losses, embarrassment, and chaos. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=420.68s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu was a warrior like perhaps no other warrior in the history of Israel. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=424.12s)]
*  And the result was something that nobody thought was possible. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=429.32s)]
*  Then Donald Trump goes on to say, Netanyahu's trial should be canceled immediately or a [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=432.56s)]
*  pardon given to a great hero. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=438.64s)]
*  What an odd statement to give. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=443.6s)]
*  By the way, let me show you two weeks ago. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=444.88s)]
*  Just I want to come with receipts. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=447.52s)]
*  I want to give you the data. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=448.76s)]
*  Remember two weeks ago when Donald Trump was in the Oval Office, you had the Juventus football [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=450.52s)]
*  club, the soccer players for our American viewers, behind him being used as a prop to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=456.64s)]
*  promote FIFA. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=461.92s)]
*  But Donald Trump kept on talking about Iran. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=463.14s)]
*  This was before the strikes. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=465.24s)]
*  And Donald Trump said he wanted total surrender, which he said was denuclearization. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=466.84s)]
*  Here, just play the clip so you can hear it for yourself. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=471.64s)]
*  President Emmanuel Macron of France the other day, the G7. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=474.88s)]
*  He's a nice guy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  Look, he said I was going back home to make a ceasefire. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=480.16s)]
*  Not a ceasefire. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=486.6s)]
*  We'll long be on ceasefire. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=487.56s)]
*  And I said, why do you say that? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=489.8s)]
*  Why would you say ceasefire? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=492.04s)]
*  It's a bad term to use because a ceasefire means like everything's going swimmingly. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=493.2s)]
*  We'll take a little time off. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=497.52s)]
*  It's not. We're not looking for a ceasefire. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=498.64s)]
*  We're looking for a total complete victory. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=501.04s)]
*  Again, you know what the victory is? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=503.88s)]
*  No nuclear weapon. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=506.2s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=508.24s)]
*  I thought it was a very badly worded statement by him. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=509.0s)]
*  And obviously, I let him know that. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=512.2s)]
*  Our editor in chief, Ron Filipkowski, I think puts it in the proper context. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=513.72s)]
*  They, the regime, are lying about Medicaid cuts. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  They're lying about the deficit increase. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=520.2s)]
*  They're lying about what they accomplished in Iran. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=522.4s)]
*  They lie about everything. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=524.6s)]
*  It's just a nonstop torrent of lies intended to flood the zone with propaganda. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=526.0s)]
*  Let's take a look at the data right here. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=532.64s)]
*  Look at May home sales. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  US May new home sales fall 13.7% month over month, which again is another recession indicator. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=537.08s)]
*  The LA Times has done a report on, they did a good job here, on who ICE has disappeared, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=547.2s)]
*  who ICE has attacked in Los Angeles. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=553.2s)]
*  Most were taken off the streets, have no criminal convictions at all. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=557.2s)]
*  It's the data point that we have. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=561.96s)]
*  And again, I think it's important that we use accurate data right here. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=563.56s)]
*  And a lot of what we see, and I'm going to just show you a short version of this clip, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=568.1999999999999s)]
*  is you just have ICE agents masked. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=572.04s)]
*  Are they actually ICE agents? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=576.0799999999999s)]
*  Are they just deputized Gestapo? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=577.56s)]
*  Here they are in Huntington Park. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=580.0s)]
*  By the way, HP, that's where my wife grew up, just so you all know. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=582.4s)]
*  That's where my wife's family lives. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=586.6s)]
*  I've been to this Home Depot before. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=588.76s)]
*  Huntington Park, hardworking Latino community that's being terrorized by ICE agents who are doing this. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=591.32s)]
*  Here, let's play this clip. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=599.32s)]
*  Horrific, horrific stuff right there. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=621.32s)]
*  And then I'll show you a short clip over here. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  This is people in wheelchairs getting arrested at the Russell Senate Office Building in DC yesterday. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=631.0s)]
*  They showed up to tell Republicans in Congress not to cut their Medicaid because they can't [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=637.96s)]
*  afford health care without it, and they will die. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=643.0400000000001s)]
*  And you'll see these individuals in wheelchairs being zip-tied and being pushed out in a line. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=646.8s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=655.56s)]
*  Finally, one of Donald Trump's disastrous moments in NATO as well. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=676.8s)]
*  He was asked by a reporter, look, you said that you would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=685.7199999999999s)]
*  but you didn't do it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=690.9599999999999s)]
*  Can you explain what's happening? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=692.4399999999999s)]
*  Can you explain why? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=693.74s)]
*  Then Donald Trump said, I never really meant that seriously. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=695.3599999999999s)]
*  I meant it sarcastically. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=699.24s)]
*  I never truly meant I could end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=700.8399999999999s)]
*  He said, but I have given peace deals between India and Pakistan, which by the way, I've [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=706.1s)]
*  showed you videos. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=713.86s)]
*  The India Prime Minister said Trump had nothing to do with the ceasefire between India and [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=714.94s)]
*  Pakistan. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=719.4200000000001s)]
*  Also, it was Donald Trump's weakness, I think, that led to the conflagration in that region [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=720.4200000000001s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=725.9s)]
*  Trump is taking place for peace in Serbia. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=727.34s)]
*  Donald Trump is taking credit for peace in Rwanda. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=729.94s)]
*  Donald Trump is taking credit for peace through, he goes, all deals in the past 30 years, he [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=733.18s)]
*  claims that he did it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=741.62s)]
*  Let me just show you what he said. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=742.8599999999999s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=743.8599999999999s)]
*  Mr. President Johannes Petra from Austrian National Television. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=744.8599999999999s)]
*  How are you? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=747.5799999999999s)]
*  You once said that you would end the Ukraine war in 24 hours. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=748.5799999999999s)]
*  You later said, you said that sarcastically. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=752.5799999999999s)]
*  Of course it was sarcastic. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=754.38s)]
*  But you've now been in office for five months and five days. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=756.5799999999999s)]
*  Why have you not been able to end the Ukraine war? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=760.42s)]
*  Because it's more difficult than people would have any idea. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=763.86s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has been more difficult. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=768.74s)]
*  Frankly, I had some problems with Zelensky. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=770.9799999999999s)]
*  You may have read about him. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=773.42s)]
*  And it's been more difficult than other wars. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=775.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, we just ended a war in 12 days that was simmering for 30 years, frankly. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=777.38s)]
*  We ended Rwanda and the Congo. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=783.42s)]
*  It's coming to sign the documents. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=786.9399999999999s)]
*  We've already signed basic documents, but they're coming, I think, to the White House [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=788.7s)]
*  on Friday. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=791.98s)]
*  We ended Serbia was going to go at it. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=794.5200000000001s)]
*  But maybe the most important of all, India and Pakistan. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=797.98s)]
*  And that wasn't whether or not they may someday have nukes like we're talking about in the [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=803.34s)]
*  Middle East, like we're talking about with Israel and Iran. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=809.0200000000001s)]
*  This is the half nuclear weapons. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=813.5200000000001s)]
*  I ended that with a series of phone calls on trade. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=815.9000000000001s)]
*  I said, Look, if you're going to go fighting each other, it's going to it was getting very [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=819.1400000000001s)]
*  bad. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=823.82s)]
*  You know how bad that last attack was. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=824.82s)]
*  It was really bad. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=825.98s)]
*  If you're going to go fighting each other, we're not doing any trade deal. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=826.98s)]
*  No, no, no, you have to do a trade deal. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=829.94s)]
*  I said, We're not doing any trade deal. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=831.82s)]
*  And in fact, I had the general was really was very impressive. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=834.6600000000001s)]
*  The general from Pakistan was in my office last week. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=839.62s)]
*  You know, Prime Minister Modi is a great friend of mine. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=845.54s)]
*  He's a great gentleman. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=848.1s)]
*  He's a great man. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=849.1s)]
*  And I got them to reason. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=850.9s)]
*  I said, We're not doing a trade deal if you're going to fight. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=851.9s)]
*  And if you're going to fight each other, we're not doing a trade deal. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=854.1s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=856.22s)]
*  He said, No, I want to do the trade deal. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=857.22s)]
*  We stopped the nuclear war. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=859.18s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=860.3s)]
*  Now, let me just share with you a clip of what Donald Trump's campaign promise was. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=861.3s)]
*  So you can judge for yourself. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=865.94s)]
*  Is Donald Trump being sarcastic or is this what he actually promised the American people [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=867.62s)]
*  about stopping the war in Ukraine in 24 hours? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=871.78s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=874.46s)]
*  End the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=875.46s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=877.22s)]
*  How would you do that? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=878.22s)]
*  I know Zelensky very well. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=879.22s)]
*  I'll end that war between those two countries in 24 hours. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=881.66s)]
*  It won't even take that long. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=886.82s)]
*  I will get the war ended. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vppx-_93H0U&t=889.18s)]
