# Trump holds DISASTER Presser in Oval as DECLINE CONTINUES
**MeidasTouch:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w)
*  Donald Trump just wrapped up a disastrous press conference in the Oval Office with the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=0.0s)]
*  Prime Minister of Italy. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=4.7s)]
*  Of course, Donald Trump mostly made it about himself, his grievances, his retribution. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump spent the time attacking the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=12.42s)]
*  who Donald Trump himself appointed in 2017. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=19.1s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=22.66s)]
*  Mr. President, on Jerome Powell, on Jerome Powell, you said that the termination of Jerome [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=23.66s)]
*  Powell cannot come fast enough. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=27.94s)]
*  He says he won't leave even if you ask him to. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=29.86s)]
*  Do you believe you have the power to remove him? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=32.26s)]
*  And are you trying to do that? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=37.26s)]
*  I don't think he's doing the job. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=38.26s)]
*  He's too late, always too late, a little slow, and I'm not happy with him. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=40.34s)]
*  I let him know it and if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump continued to attack Chairman Powell because Chairman Powell accurately [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=55.58s)]
*  described that our economy is having big problems now created by the Trump regime. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=60.66s)]
*  Donald Trump in this Oval Office press conference says he doesn't know what Congo even is the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=67.34s)]
*  country. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=73.58s)]
*  He doesn't know what it is, but he says they're doing bad things. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=74.58s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=78.38s)]
*  All over the world, the Congo and Africa, many, many people come from the Congo. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=79.38s)]
*  I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo and all over the world they [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=84.18s)]
*  came in hoping that... [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=89.06s)]
*  Donald Trump next addresses the school shooting that took place at the FSU Student Union, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=90.46000000000001s)]
*  or I should say he mentions it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=95.86000000000001s)]
*  He doesn't really address it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=98.14000000000001s)]
*  His statement is, quote, things like this take place, is his response to the horrific [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=100.14000000000001s)]
*  tragedy that took place today. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=106.98s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=108.98s)]
*  I've been briefed on this Florida State University, Tallahassee, active shooter. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=109.98s)]
*  I guess it's an active shooter. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=116.78s)]
*  A fully brief as to where we are right now, it's a shame. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=118.78s)]
*  Horrible thing, horrible that things like this take place. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=123.78s)]
*  We'll have more to say about it later. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=127.78s)]
*  Donald Trump then said that Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is going [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=131.78s)]
*  to face a lot of political pressure. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=137.18s)]
*  He goes, you know, these are political guys and so you're going to face a lot of pressure. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=139.78s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=144.78s)]
*  I just come down quite a bit and I would say the Fed really owes it to the American people [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=145.78s)]
*  to get interest rates down. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=153.38s)]
*  That's the only thing he's good for and he would have an effect on that if he lowered [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=154.78s)]
*  them. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=159.78s)]
*  And I think at some point he will. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=160.78s)]
*  He's going to have a lot of political pressure. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=162.98s)]
*  You know, they are political also and I think there's a lot of political pressure for him [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=164.58s)]
*  to lower interest rates. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=169.98000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=171.78s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=172.78s)]
*  Please. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=176.78s)]
*  Once again, let me repeat. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=177.78s)]
*  Donald Trump appointed Chairman Powell in 2017. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=179.78s)]
*  Okay, so now Donald Trump is attacking his own person because his own person is saying [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=183.78s)]
*  accurately that the economy is struggling right now because of Trump's failed trade [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=189.98s)]
*  war with the world. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=194.78s)]
*  Donald Trump then says that Jimmy Carter, late president, is actually a happy man. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=196.78s)]
*  He died happy because he was better than Biden. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=203.18s)]
*  This is again the deranged demented mind of a freaking lunatic. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=206.18s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=210.18s)]
*  We're useless. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=211.18s)]
*  They were incompetent. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=211.78s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=212.78s)]
*  Worst than Jimmy Carter. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=216.18s)]
*  Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=217.18s)]
*  You know why? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=219.38s)]
*  Because he wasn't the worst president. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=220.38s)]
*  Joe Biden was. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=223.38s)]
*  So I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers where this all happens. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=225.38s)]
*  It's happening now. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=230.38s)]
*  I mean, everybody wants to make a deal. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=231.38s)]
*  A reporter then asks Donald Trump to clarify his views about Chairman Powell and about [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=233.38s)]
*  what he intends to do to Chairman Powell. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=239.98s)]
*  Chairman Powell does not reduce interest rates. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=242.38s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=245.78s)]
*  Can you clarify on rate cuts? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=247.38s)]
*  Do you intend to see Powell's firing if he doesn't change his stance on rate cuts? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=249.38s)]
*  Or is that on the table? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=255.38s)]
*  Well, I think he should do the rate cuts because I think if Europe has done it, he puts us [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=257.38s)]
*  at a disadvantage to Europe. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=262.38s)]
*  I mean, he plays right into their hands. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=264.38s)]
*  So I think he should do the rate cuts. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=267.38s)]
*  We don't have really inflation now. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=268.38s)]
*  I just said the major things are going down. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=270.38s)]
*  Oil is great. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=273.38s)]
*  Oil is way ahead of schedule. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=275.38s)]
*  And that's because of our policies. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=277.38s)]
*  But oil is down into the $60, $65 range now per barrel. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=279.38s)]
*  And I told you, in certain states, we have less than $2 for gasoline and food is down. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=285.38s)]
*  Groceries, as we call it, are down. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=293.38s)]
*  Other than interest rates, everything's down. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=296.38s)]
*  Interest rates are pretty flat. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=300.38s)]
*  It's not that they're up. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=302.38s)]
*  But we should be better than flat. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=303.38s)]
*  If he would lower the interest rate, I think would have a good impact on that too. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=305.38s)]
*  But the costs are down. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=309.38s)]
*  We have very little inflation. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=311.38s)]
*  I would say we have essentially no inflation. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=313.38s)]
*  Hard to have inflation when oil goes down. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=315.38s)]
*  And it's just interesting that Donald Trump continues to cite Europe's central bank as a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=317.38s)]
*  reason the United States should be doing interest rate cuts. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=323.38s)]
*  You know, Donald, we were doing interest rate cuts in the United States. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=327.38s)]
*  You know when? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=331.38s)]
*  Under former President Biden. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=332.38s)]
*  You know why? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=334.38s)]
*  Because inflation was hitting its Fed target rate of 2% based on things like the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=335.38s)]
*  Former President Biden had to clean up the mess left by you, the arsonist. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=343.38s)]
*  The arsonist then claimed that the person putting out the fire was actually the arsonist. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=348.38s)]
*  You came back into power and now, once again, voila, you are the arsonist again, screwing up the economy. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=353.38s)]
*  Causing inflation to rise such that interest rates can't be taken down. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=360.38s)]
*  Now, one of the expressions that I've heard and Carl Quintanilla has said it before, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=366.38s)]
*  what Trump wants to do is try to burn down the house in order to cook a steak. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=370.38s)]
*  So you're trying to destroy the entire economy, blow it all up to what? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=376.38s)]
*  To lower the interest rates when the economy is going to be literally the worst since the Great Depression. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=382.38s)]
*  Like that's the game plan. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=389.38s)]
*  Donald Trump then says that there are lots of countries calling them up, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=391.38s)]
*  so many countries calling them up to make deals that he maybe doesn't even want to do deals with them. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=394.38s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=399.38s)]
*  Very well with negotiations, I think with all countries. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=400.38s)]
*  Scott could tell you a little bit, but we are doing very well. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=404.38s)]
*  We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=409.38s)]
*  Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=412.38s)]
*  Go ahead, Scott. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=414.38s)]
*  You're smart enough to know when something's not working. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=415.38s)]
*  Like when you can't focus at work or when you're dragging by 2 p.m. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=418.38s)]
*  or when your stomach feels like it's fighting you after every meal. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=421.38s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=425.38s)]
*  These aren't random symptoms. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=426.38s)]
*  Your gut impacts everything from your digestion to your brain function to your energy levels. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=428.38s)]
*  That's why we love Just Thrive probiotic. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=433.38s)]
*  Unlike other brands that make big promises but fall apart in your stomach, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=437.38s)]
*  Just Thrive is the only probiotic clinically proven to arrive in your gut 100 percent alive. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=441.38s)]

*  We heard this earlier today in the White House when Donald Trump was asked about Xi Jinping now meeting with allies of the United States [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=482.38s)]
*  and China cutting deals as Donald Trump has turned America into basically the manifestation of a Trump dollar sign, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=490.38s)]
*  meme coin, or a dollar sign, Smellania meme coin. Play this clip. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=500.38s)]
*  On China, Mr. President, you said you have allies. You have said in the past that you aren't worried about allies. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=505.38s)]
*  You've grown closer to China as a result of the tariffs. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=512.38s)]
*  And this week we saw Chinese President Xi Jinping say that three of our allies, should you be worried that they're growing closer? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=515.38s)]
*  No. No. Nobody can compete with us. Nobody. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=522.38s)]
*  Going back to the disastrous Oval Office press conference, Donald Trump is asked again about, you know, these, you know, what about these trade deals? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=529.38s)]
*  Americans are suffering, to which Donald Trump says, Americans aren't suffering. We're doing great. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=538.38s)]
*  He goes, everything's down. Prices are down. Things are great. Americans are thriving. They're great again right now. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=543.38s)]
*  He goes, the only thing that's bad is interest rates. Play this clip. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=549.38s)]
*  You did say that you are confident these deals will be done, but you also said that you're in no rush. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=552.38s)]
*  Americans are seeing prices rise. They're seeing it on their bills. How long can they expect that pain to last? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=557.38s)]
*  So they've already seen it get much better because if you were truthful, which you're not, you know, I know you very well. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=563.38s)]
*  You have gasoline. And down in 98 yesterday in a couple of states, you have gasoline's way down. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=572.38s)]
*  The price of oil has dropped substantially. I'm going to bring the data at the end of this video. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=580.38s)]
*  Don't worry where I'm going to fact check everything that he's saying because it's all 100 percent false. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=585.38s)]
*  But what else is new? How do you know Donald Trump and MAG is lying? They open up their mouth here. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=590.38s)]
*  Donald Trump then talks about the only thing that's going up. Our interest rates. Play this clip. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=595.38s)]
*  So prices have gone up. The only thing that's gone up actually is interest rates because we have a Federal Reserve Chairman that is playing politics. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=602.38s)]
*  Somebody that I've never been very fond of, actually. But he's playing politics. Interest rates should be down now. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=611.38s)]
*  They should be coming down in Europe. As you know, they reduced them, I guess, seven times. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=619.38s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again and again and again. But our guy wants to play cute. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=625.38s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. Maybe they went up just a slight bit, but that's the only thing. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=630.38s)]
*  But that's because of the Federal Reserve and because they're not very smart people. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=637.38s)]
*  Trump is then asked, what's going to happen, Donald, if a federal judge holds you in contempt? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=642.38s)]
*  And Trump throws his DOJ under the bus. He's like, oh, it's not going to be me. Ask the lawyers. Ask the DOJ lawyers. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=649.38s)]
*  You hear that, DOJ lawyers? Here, play this clip. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=656.38s)]
*  Well, I'm not involved in it. I'm going to respond by saying you'll have to speak to the lawyers, the DOJ. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=670.38s)]
*  I've heard many things about him and we'll have to find out what the truth is. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=676.38s)]
*  Again, just take a look at some charts. I like charts. I like data. I'm a data guy. I'm a chart guy. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=683.38s)]
*  Federal spending up right now, more federal spending now than under former President Biden for everything that Doge said it was going to do. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=689.38s)]
*  Didn't do it. The US dollars having the worst start to a year since 1995. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=697.38s)]
*  Consumer confidence right now is at its lowest point since 1981, its second lowest point since 1951 or 52 when University of Michigan really started doing its consumer confidence survey. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=704.38s)]
*  We've now heard from the Atlanta Fed, which believes negative 2.2 percent GDP contraction in quarter one. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=718.38s)]
*  We've heard from the New York and Philly feds, which show manufacturing declining at a rapid pace. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=725.38s)]
*  American Express put out guidance assuming in their guidance that there will be an average unemployment of around 5.7 percent. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=732.38s)]
*  But they think that their business will be largely immune from any great recession because they have wealthy people as clientele. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=740.38s)]
*  This just in, mortgage rates see the largest one week hike in nearly a year, reaching their highest level in two months. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=748.38s)]
*  I've seen some mortgage rates as high as 7, 7.5 percent, some slightly lower, but housing is not more affordable. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=755.38s)]
*  Prices are going up. The price of eggs. Remember the price of eggs are higher. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=762.38s)]
*  Donald Trump is a complete liar and a complete failure in everything that he does. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=767.38s)]
*  But he goes there in the Oval Office and lies like living people breathe. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=772.38s)]
*  That's kind of how Donald Trump exists. As I said in my substack on MidasPlus.com today, go check it out MidasPlus.com and spell it right. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88hSniFmf7w&t=776.38s)]
