# All HELL BREAKS LOOSE as Trump turns LA into WAR ZONE
**MeidasTouch:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw)
*  That was filmed in downtown Los Angeles where all hell was breaking loose on Friday as ICE and ATF [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=0.0s)]
*  and others were conducting raids against the immigrant community in Los Angeles. And the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=18.8s)]
*  Los Angeles people were not having it. They were pissed off and they were letting ICE and ATF [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=26.08s)]
*  and LAPD and others at DHS know how angry they were. So here's where ICE raided. They went to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  the courthouse, Roy Ball it's called, which is in downtown Los Angeles. And they were waiting for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=42.4s)]
*  people in the bushes, waiting for people inside the courtroom. And when immigrants showed up [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=48.4s)]
*  for their court proceedings, they were immediately detained, basically regardless of their status, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=53.919999999999995s)]
*  and thrown into the basement. And then they were kind of one by one interrogated. And then the ICE [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=60.72s)]
*  agents would determine who they were going to deport after detaining them all in the basement. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=67.92s)]
*  These were people who were just going through the lawful process as part of their court proceedings [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=73.68s)]
*  and showing up. Then you had ICE agents target home depots in downtown Los Angeles, just immigrants [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=79.2s)]
*  who were there who just wanted to work, who would normally kind of hang out in the parking lot area. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=89.04s)]
*  You had ICE ready to kind of raid the parking lots where people were just waiting, immigrants were [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=94.8s)]
*  just waiting and hoping to get work for the day. And then the other area that ICE was raiding is [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=100.64s)]
*  multiple locations of something called Ambience, which was these factories, Ambience factories, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=107.04s)]
*  which is like apparel and clothing. And so you had the ICE agents raiding Ambience apparel locations [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  in downtown Los Angeles. And people were pissed. It looked like a war zone in Los Angeles. Let [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=122.56s)]
*  me show you what went down. Here's another video of, and you can see the kind of militarized ICE [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=129.68s)]
*  agents and DHS and ATF. I mean, they turned downtown Los Angeles into a total war zone. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  I want you to watch this. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=144.08s)]
*  Also, again, these ICE agents were getting very violent with people who were just there observing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=159.68s)]
*  and others who were there just to kind of protest their presence and others who were there [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=175.52s)]
*  to just let immigrants know their rights. The president of the California chapter of the SEIU, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=179.84s)]
*  someone named David Huerta was assaulted and arrested by ICE agents during an ICE raid in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=188.88s)]
*  the warehouse district of downtown Los Angeles. Let me show you the video of what went down there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=195.68s)]
*  Really sick stuff. Here, play this clip. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  We just got a statement from SEIU California president David Huerta. This comes from SEIU. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=218.88s)]
*  David Huerta, president of SEIU California and SEIU United Service Workers West, was injured [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=241.84s)]
*  and detained at an ICE raid in Los Angeles today while exercising his First Amendment [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=248.0s)]
*  right to observe and document law enforcement activity. Tia Orr, executive director of SEIU [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=252.8s)]
*  California, made the following statement. SEIU California members call for the immediate release [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=258.32s)]
*  of our president, David Huerta, who was injured and detained at the site of one of today's ICE [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=263.84s)]
*  raids in Los Angeles. He is now receiving medical attention while in custody. We are proud of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=268.88s)]
*  President Huerta's righteous participation as a community observer and keeping with his long [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=274.08s)]
*  history of advocating for immigrant workers and with the highest values of our movement, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  standing up to injustice regardless of personal risk or the power of those perpetrating it. We [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=284.56s)]
*  call for an end to the cruel, destructive and indiscriminate ICE raids that are tearing apart [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=290.64s)]
*  our communities, disrupting our economy and hurting all working people. Immigrant workers [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=295.44s)]
*  are essential to our society, feeding our nation, caring for our elders, cleaning our workplaces [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=300.72s)]
*  and building our homes. California Senator Alex Padilla, who I've had here on the Midas Touch [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=306.64000000000004s)]
*  Network, issued the following statement. The ICE raids across Los Angeles are a continuation of a [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=312.32000000000005s)]
*  disturbing pattern of extreme and cruel immigration enforcement operations across the country. These [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=319.20000000000005s)]
*  indiscriminate raids prove once again that the Trump administration cares about nothing but [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=325.44s)]
*  instilling harm and fear in our communities to drive immigrants into the shadows. It will not [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=331.84s)]
*  work. This fear mongering is not going to change the fact that immigrants are valued members of our [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=337.52s)]
*  communities who contribute to our society and economy, and my office will demand accountability [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=341.92s)]
*  for today's actions. I want to share with you some additional video. This comes from the Citizen App [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=348.4s)]
*  right here, and you can see ICE raiding the warehouses over here. I'm only going to show [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=354.08s)]
*  about 24 seconds of it, but it goes on and on and on where immigrants were hard at work contributing [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=359.68s)]
*  to Los Angeles and to our economy. Here, play this clip. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=365.84s)]
*  Basically, I'm right outside the hotel. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=384.08s)]
*  Now, one of the things they were saying on ABC 7 while they had their helicopter, their chopper, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=394.24s)]
*  observing the response to the ICE agents, because the people in Los Angeles, especially in downtown [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=400.88s)]
*  LA, were letting these ICE agents know that they were not okay with what was going on, that this [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=407.52s)]
*  was not acceptable. And here's how it was described on ABC. These ICE agents know they will be met with [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=412.4s)]
*  resistance, but not quite sure they knew it would be at this level today. Here, play this clip. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=419.12s)]
*  Everyone has left that area. Right. And I do believe that these agents, the FBI, the ICE agents, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=424.23999999999995s)]
*  they know they are going to be met with resistance. I'm not quite sure if they thought it was going to [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  be to this level today, the way they saw people surrounding these vehicles leaving, trying to keep [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=436.64s)]
*  inside the area. And then once more reinforcements came. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=442.64s)]
*  My kids want video calls with grandma and grandpa, but my in-laws get confused trying to join on their [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  phone. I want seeing their grandkids to be easy and fun. This podcast is sponsored by Jubilee TV. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=450.64s)]
*  Now, did you know over 37 million U.S. adults provide unpaid care for an elderly loved one? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=456.72s)]
*  Being a caregiver for seniors is challenging. Support their independence and your peace of mind [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=461.76s)]
*  with Jubilee TV. Jubilee TV connects your loved one's TV to your phone so you can fix tech issues [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=466.32s)]

*  adults to learn. They just use their TV. It's familiar and accessible and they can even keep [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=482.96s)]
*  their old remote. Now I got Jubilee TV for my in-laws last month. Absolute game changer. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=488.56s)]
*  Virtual drop-ins are a great option and they love using the TV for video calls. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=493.68s)]
*  Once I learned about Jubilee TV, I had to sign up. So perfect for people with aging parents. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=498.32s)]

*  taking important medications, or going to an appointment to support their routine. Jubilee TV [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=517.6s)]
*  lets me respect my in-laws independence. Now I keep an eye on their health and safety through the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=523.52s)]
*  TV without being intrusive. I use Jubilee TV to virtually put on my mother-in-law's favorite shows. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=527.52s)]
*  Now she loves the help and now she never misses her beloved Wheel of Fortune. My in-laws love [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=533.52s)]
*  Jubilee TV and the fact that I can lend a helping hand at the drop of a dime is perfect. Head to [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=538.16s)]
*  getjubileeTV.com and use code MIDAS for $25 off your order. Once again, that's getjubileeTV.com [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=544.56s)]
*  and use code MIDAS for $25 off so they know that I sent you. Thank you. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=554.64s)]
*  Why are you collaborating with us? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=615.6s)]
*  You're taking place when you had dozens of FBI, ATF, and DHS agents in camo fatigues with guns out here. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=648.24s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=654.0s)]
*  So you said you had a lot of ATF agents, but you also said Homeland Security, we saw ICE agents. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=678.32s)]
*  You said, but they have mostly focused on just the one building ambiance, correct? And now as they [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=686.0s)]
*  leave, we're starting to see more tear gas and it looks like fireworks. So the crowd is continuing [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=692.48s)]
*  to engage with the officers who are very methodically starting to leave the area. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=698.5600000000001s)]
*  Communicating with Carlos. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to point out to here our screen [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=707.6s)]
*  there on the right and Carlos's shot are both live. But what we want to point out here is how [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=712.4000000000001s)]
*  these officers are now leaving the ATF officers are very slowly moving. And you'll notice that [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=717.6s)]
*  some on the ground are trying to get the people to move out of the way. We have a piece of video [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=723.44s)]
*  that showed the vans as they were departing with some of the people that had been detained [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=729.7600000000001s)]
*  in those vans. And it was a very different scene. You can see that they've gotten the people and [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=736.4s)]
*  they put them in these vans. And as these officers, these authorities started to leave, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=741.36s)]
*  it was a very strange sight to see because they started to leave and there were people who were [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=749.2s)]
*  protesting trying to keep these vans from getting out. And the video seen here is deeply troubling [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=755.52s)]
*  because these officers look, there's that person in front and the officers. This was [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=762.72s)]
*  another disturbing incident where an agent actually pulled his gun out here. Let me show you this. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=767.9200000000001s)]
*  Multiple simultaneous federal raids happening involving Homeland Security leading to clashes [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  in downtown LA. Stu Mendele live up in Sky Fox to tell us all about it. Stu? Hey Sandra, this is [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=798.88s)]
*  going to be one of two locations or actually three locations that Sky Fox has been over this [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=806.72s)]
*  afternoon. This one seems to be the most active. Now this is going to be in the downtown Los Angeles [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=811.12s)]
*  area near the corner 15th and Santa Fe. This is the ambient headquarters. And that is one of the [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=816.24s)]
*  other places that they were targeting in downtown. The showroom actually in the downtown area off of [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=822.4s)]
*  15th and town. But they've also been hitting up the home depots, at least two of them in the Los [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=827.76s)]
*  Angeles area as well. I can tell you since Sky Fox has been here, they've been put at least five [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=833.12s)]
*  people inside that van that you see right there. Now it has definitely gotten a lot more tense out [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=838.0s)]
*  here in the last couple of minutes and LAPD has arrived as well. Usually LAPD stays away from any [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=843.92s)]
*  of these types of raids. But in this case, it is crowd control is why they're here and what's going [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=850.8s)]
*  on. Moments before we went live, there was a large crowd in front of this gate right here. They opened [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=855.76s)]
*  that gate up to allow a van that looks like the one that's in there in as to take them possibly to [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=860.4799999999999s)]
*  take away some other people or even maybe some of their own FBI and other agents that are in that [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=866.0799999999999s)]

*  While that was going on, a large scuffle took place. People were trying to block the van. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=878.24s)]
*  Agents came out and were actually physically fighting with some of those protesters and one of [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=882.64s)]

*  the reason why the fire department is here. The fire department showed up basically for medical use [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=898.64s)]
*  or to check out the injuries to that person they took into custody. Take a look at what's going on. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=903.68s)]
*  LAPD, they've been arriving. They've been setting up a skirmish line out here trying to keep the [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=908.7199999999999s)]

*  conducting raids throughout the greater LA proper area like in Torrance, for example. This has been [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=920.0s)]
*  a story getting a lot of attention here in LA. A Torrance boy, nine years old, was detained by ICE [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=926.4s)]
*  with plans to deport him to Honduras. The community is outraged. Earlier this week, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=933.36s)]

*  out that that's actually what went down when he was basically taken into detention by these ICE [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=958.16s)]
*  agents. Really, really sick stuff going on here right now and across the country. You'll recall [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9nxdZJbOZw&t=965.68s)]
