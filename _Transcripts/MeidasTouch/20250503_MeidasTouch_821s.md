# Fox News has MELTDOWN as Trump WRECKS IT ALL
**MeidasTouch:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc)
*  Fox News is in meltdown mode as MAGA Republican senators are basically saying this budget bill [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=0.0s)]
*  that Donald Trump is calling a big beautiful bill is an utter, utter disaster. Let me show you what [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=7.84s)]
*  went down when you had MAGA Republican Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin on Fox Business Yesterday [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=15.52s)]
*  play this clip. But the the tax bill, will we get it before Memorial Day? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=23.92s)]
*  No, no there's no way because again unfortunately President Trump chose the one big beautiful bill [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=30.24s)]
*  what he should have done is the multiple step process. I suggest three steps, get the border [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=35.84s)]
*  funding, second step just extend current tax law so we take an automatic tax increase off the table. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=40.64s)]
*  Will we get it before the end of the year quickly? Not if we don't come down with a reasonable [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=45.36s)]
*  pre-pandemic level spending. There's enough of us in the Senate that will not agree to that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=50.96s)]
*  Boy that's bad news. Senator thank you for that, appreciate it, have a good weekend, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=54.24s)]
*  appreciate you coming on. You too. You have one job in Congress, it would be nice if you actually [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=58.48s)]
*  passed legislation that held people but you can't do that. You pass a budget not these ridiculous [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=65.2s)]
*  continuing resolutions that carry out the budget of Nancy Pelosi while you have Doge [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=70.96s)]
*  violate the Constitution. You heard Ron Johnson there in his own words basically saying the entire [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=77.6s)]
*  budget process has been utterly utterly destroyed but when you live in MAGA fake fantasy lie world [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=83.12s)]
*  all the time the truth doesn't even matter. All that matters is you continue your Ponzi scheme, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=90.64s)]
*  your rug pull until catastrophe strikes. So you remember how when the GDP numbers this past week [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  came out and our economy was contracting it was negative point three percent GDP. Remember all of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=104.72s)]
*  Trump and JD and everybody in Fox were saying this is the Biden economy. Biden is destroying [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=112.56s)]
*  everything right now even though former president Biden had record job growth GDP increasing [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=119.6s)]
*  16.2 million jobs record low unemployment. I can go on and on and on. There was a decent jobs [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=126.16s)]
*  report not like a didn't blow it out of the water but the jobs report was fine 177,000 jobs. Good, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=132.64s)]
*  good. We want there to be jobs. Now what do you think the response was on on on Friday? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=139.2s)]
*  This is the Trump economy. This shows everything we said. Things are great here playing this clip. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=146.16s)]
*  This is a very important report with all of the hysteria over tariffs. We know the jobs are being [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  created and it is much better than expected at 177,000 jobs added to the economy in April. This [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=157.04s)]
*  proves Donald Trump's point that the economy is doing well. You know like literally at the exact [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  same time you're doing that your messaging is mixed right. You have JD Vance interviewing with [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  Brett Baer saying oh the economy is bad because of Biden while they have other people on Fox saying [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=178.39999999999998s)]
*  the economy is doing great now because of Trump. Can you even all they do is they lie about [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=186.4s)]
*  everything. They just flood the zone with lies. Watch this. So the first thing is when you talk [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=192.08s)]
*  about the economy this is Joe Biden's economy and we inherited two trillion dollars of debt. The [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  highest peacetime deficits in American history a 1.2 trillion dollar trade deficit which fundamentally [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=203.6s)]
*  means we're not making enough of our own stuff. Then speaking about flooding the zones with lies [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=209.28s)]
*  you then have Janine Pirro who I guess used to be a judge but thinking about being in front of her [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=215.04s)]
*  court with her lack of ethics and her despicable behavior is a frightening concept in and of itself [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=222.88s)]
*  and so she's like of course Abrangos MS-13 look at his knuckles. It has marijuana, skull, cross, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=229.44s)]
*  smiley face, smiley face, smiley face. As one commentator noted got to avoid those dangerous [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  neighborhoods where everyone has smiley face tattoos. Here play this clip. And he's got all [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=248.0s)]
*  the chats and don't tell me he's not MS-13. I had a gang unit in my office. I had gang investigators. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=254.0s)]
*  You've got marijuana. You've got the skull. You've got the plus and I think you've got the I forget [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  the smiley face that he's telling the world he's MS-13 and you know what I'm not sure if you saw [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=266.96s)]
*  this going viral. It says someone who was a tattoo artist for 30 years commented on YouTube that he's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=272.23999999999995s)]
*  seen this tattoo many times and it means smoke weed to get high love God till you die. See this [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=278.79999999999995s)]
*  is why due process is so important. Look I don't know what the tattoos mean. It doesn't say the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=285.12s)]
*  letters MS and the numbers 13 on it but you're entitled to due process even if he wasn't MS-13 [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  member you know at one point in time in his life the Trump first administration gave the guy a work [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=296.96s)]
*  permit in 2019. So clearly the Trump administration thought that the guy wasn't a gang leader. Why [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  else would you give the guy a work permit and have him show up once a year? He checks into ICE. He [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=311.76s)]
*  was a member of a union. He's married to an American woman. He has three American children. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=316.24s)]
*  You give the person due process. If it turns out that they're affiliated with the gang you have [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=321.28s)]
*  to determine if there's a crime that is committed and then ultimately if we're dealing with a [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=326.56s)]
*  migrant yes you could deport but then also deporting to concentration camps is not the remedy [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=331.84s)]
*  especially where there's a withholding order saying you can't do that. We're just a nation of due [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=339.6s)]
*  process okay. You know even by people in the Taliban if they were here the supreme court [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  ruled in the United States you got to give them due process because you can't just jump to the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=350.64s)]
*  conclusion oh this person must be a felon this person's definitely a criminal because taken to [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=355.36s)]
*  the logical conclusion you point at anybody you're a felon you're a gang member you're this you go [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=360.64s)]
*  to concentration camps you go to a court you put forward the evidence that's our system if you [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=365.36s)]
*  think it's slow if you think it's messy too bad so sad we have a United States constitution and we [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  have still a supreme court that says you have to have due process that's just it it's not a debate [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  it's not a discussion you know there's no some legal scholars say no there's due process in [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=382.72s)]
*  America you don't like it move to Russia okay. You ever been stuck in a checkout line that felt like [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=388.16s)]

*  card reader went down then they told me it was cash only and guess who didn't have any cash? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=397.44000000000005s)]
*  Yep me. Had to sprint to an ATM across the street pay those ATM fees it was total chaos. That's why [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=402.32000000000005s)]

*  couldn't be more honored to serve under the president with these jobs numbers and now as [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=511.04s)]

*  in years energy is down substantially I am told that in parts of Florida gasoline is a dollar 93 [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=545.76s)]
*  and that's an automatic tax cut for the American people so we're probably going to see a lot more [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=554.88s)]
*  car travel this summer and you know so I think things are in good shape and you know I saw some [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=561.2s)]
*  people speculate how Donald Trump even got to this number of a dollar and 89 cents and it's [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=568.0s)]
*  possible that like people in his administration were just showing him data that talks about [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=573.84s)]

*  of wholesale unfinished gasoline which does not include the cost of oxygenates ethanol and all the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=594.0799999999999s)]
*  distribution marketing costs and telling him this is the price of gasoline you're paying at a pump [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=601.76s)]
*  it's like when he tariffs the penguins right it's like when he tariffs you know he comes up with [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=606.7199999999999s)]

*  the equation after all of that and do you hope that the president is successful in creating [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=635.76s)]
*  a strong economy at the end of this once the deals are worked out with a lot of major countries [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=642.72s)]

*  seeing as a president who along with Howard Lutnick he is self-dealing on crypto and by the way Howard [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  Lutnick owns his own crypto business on the side instead of worrying about the strength of the US [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVjz-XgqVc&t=669.36s)]
