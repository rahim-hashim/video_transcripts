# FURIOUS World Leaders CHECKMATE Trump AT NATO
**MeidasTouch:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg)
*  World leaders, and in particular NATO leaders, are absolutely furious at Donald Trump, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=0.0s)]
*  they're taking action, forming joint defense pacts with each other, making deals with each [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=6.36s)]
*  other, and cutting little old Donald Trump and the United States out of their deals because [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=12.92s)]
*  Donald Trump's threats to their sovereignty. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=19.28s)]
*  One of the most obvious examples of this in the past 48 hours, Canada and EU entered into [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  a joint defense pact and a broader economic relationship. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=29.12s)]
*  Yep, they entered into an actual deal. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=34.2s)]
*  So while Donald Trump is threatening the sovereignty of Canada and calling it the 51st state, the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  Prime Minister of Canada, Mark Carney, flew to Europe a day before the NATO summit at [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=43.6s)]
*  The Hague in Netherlands was set to take place, met with the leaders of the European Union [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=49.72s)]
*  and EU Commission, and announced a major defense deal with the European Union. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=54.88s)]
*  And Prime Minister Carney said, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=61.72s)]
*  In other words, goodbye, Donald. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=71.12s)]
*  Goodbye, United States of America. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=73.84s)]
*  And one of the things that I've noticed already at this NATO summit is how small and weak [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  Trump and the United States look. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=82.08s)]
*  It's an unfortunate thing for me to say this as an American, but it is just the reality. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=84.0s)]
*  Take a look at this photo right here of just Donald Trump. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=89.44s)]
*  Look how uncomfortable he looks, how isolated he looks, just how bizarre and strange he [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=92.08s)]
*  looks when he's actually with world leaders. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  When he's in his safe space like Air Force One or Mar-a-Lago in the White House, and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  he can yell at reporters, he sings a different tune. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=106.84s)]
*  Before he flew to the NATO summit in The Hague or while he was flying, he spoke to reporters [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=110.8s)]
*  and they asked him, are you committed to Article 5 of NATO? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  And Donald Trump says, I don't know. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=122.12s)]
*  It depends on your definition. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  There's lots of definitions. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=125.88s)]
*  No, Donald, there were not a lot of definitions of Article 5's mutual defense pact, which [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=127.16s)]
*  when it was invoked in the past was done to help the United States after 9-11. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=133.6s)]
*  But here's what Donald Trump said. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=139.04s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  Are you committed to Article 5 of NATO? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  Depends on your definition. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  There's numerous definitions of Article 5, you know that, right? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  But I'm committed to being their friend. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=149.76s)]
*  You know, I've become friends with many of those leaders and I'm committed to helping them. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=152.88s)]
*  And it just seems that all Donald Trump wanted to do was talk about Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=157.44s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=162.28s)]
*  Putin called me. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=163.28s)]
*  Putin called me. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=164.28s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=165.28s)]
*  I'd like to see a deal with Russia. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=166.28s)]
*  As you know, Vladimir called me up. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=169.28s)]
*  He said, can I help you with the rent? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=170.76s)]
*  I said, no, I don't need help with the rent. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=172.48s)]
*  I need help with you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=173.88s)]
*  And I hope we're going to be getting a deal done with Russia. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=174.88s)]
*  And then Trump has asked if he will meet with Zelensky. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=179.84s)]
*  And here's what he had to say. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=182.2s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=183.48s)]
*  Do you think you'll meet with Zelensky when you're there? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=184.48s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=186.48s)]
*  I'll see him. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=187.48s)]
*  What would you say to him? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=188.48s)]
*  Say, how you doing? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=189.48s)]
*  He's in a tough situation. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=190.48s)]
*  Should have never been there. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=191.48s)]
*  So now talking about this joint defense pact between Canada and the European Union. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=192.67999999999998s)]
*  Here's the headline. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=202.56s)]
*  Canada signs defense pact with EU. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  The partnership will help both Ottawa and Brussels deliver NATO's new capability requirements. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=206.6s)]
*  But let's dig deeper. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=212.0s)]
*  Can I show you what the defense pact actually looks like? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=213.0s)]
*  Not a fake deal, but a real deal. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=217.26s)]
*  Here's the defense pact. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=219.92s)]
*  You'll see it right here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  Security and defense partnership between the European Union and Canada. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=223.36s)]
*  Let's just take a look at the preface of it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=226.8s)]
*  Here, let's take a look. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=229.36s)]
*  The European Union and Canada face a deteriorating security environment and must tackle common [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  threats and challenges together. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=237.52s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  What do you think they're talking about here? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  Our security is interconnected and interdependent. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  It is not limited to traditional military and defense related issues, but is increasingly [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=246.44s)]
*  multi-dimensional ranging from the rapidly evolving cyber, emerging tech and hybrid [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=251.12s)]
*  threats to maritime and outer space, including the protection of critical infrastructure [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=256.24s)]
*  and societal resilience and economic security. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=261.24s)]
*  The EU and Canada are closely aligned in their adherence to international law and are united [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  to uphold and strengthen the rules based international order based on the purposes and principles [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=271.12s)]
*  of the United States Charter. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  Again, that's a reference to Trump if you haven't realized. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=281.11999999999995s)]
*  Respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=285.28s)]
*  underpin the cooperation between the EU and Canada. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=290.88s)]
*  The EU and Canada are also key and strategic partners in security and defense. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  As highlighted in the EU strategic compass for security and defense, the EU, Canada have [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  longstanding cooperation in security and defense demonstrates a joint commitment to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=307.7s)]
*  peace and security. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=312.46s)]
*  It goes on to talk about how in this current security environment, mutually reinforcing [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=315.0s)]
*  EU NATO strategic partnerships is essential for Euro Atlantic security. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=321.86s)]
*  This partnership is implemented in line and with the agreed principles of mutual openness [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=329.5s)]
*  and transparency, inclusiveness, reciprocity in full respect of the decision making autonomy [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=335.5s)]
*  and procedures of both organizations. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=342.26s)]
*  And it goes on to talk about in light of the shared foreign security policy challenges, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=345.9s)]
*  including Russia's unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine, the EU [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=351.22s)]
*  and Canada are also closely aligned in their firm and enduring support of Ukraine. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=356.18s)]
*  The EU and Canada wish to intensify their cooperation to better meet shared security [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=361.5s)]
*  challenges. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=366.94s)]
*  So let's take a look over here what Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada said at this [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=368.66s)]
*  special summit that took place before the NATO summit. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=374.0s)]
*  Here this was the EU Canada portion where they just met together and Prime Minister [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=379.16s)]
*  Carney is like, we are moving beyond the past. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=385.3s)]
*  We're not clinging to that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=389.5s)]
*  We're moving to the future. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=390.9s)]
*  The future is Canada and the European Union. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=392.53999999999996s)]
*  The message cannot be clear, clearer. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=395.4s)]
*  Goodbye, Trump. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=397.62s)]
*  Goodbye, USA. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=399.17999999999995s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=400.65999999999997s)]
*  So we're meeting now in that context in, as you just said, in hard times. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=401.65999999999997s)]
*  We might say even a hinge moment of history, a world that's more dangerous and divided, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=407.29999999999995s)]
*  a time where the rules-based international, the global order, rules-based global order [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=413.46s)]
*  is under threat in a time when technological change is accelerating. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=418.78000000000003s)]
*  And we really have two choices. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=423.54s)]
*  This is a jurisdiction as a country in this circumstance. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=426.62s)]
*  We can nostalgically look back and long for the old order to somehow return or we can [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=429.54s)]
*  build a new one with purpose and partnership. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=436.06s)]
*  And as the most European of the non-European countries, Canada looks first to the European [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=440.6s)]
*  Union to build a better world. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=446.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's what today is about. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=449.8s)]
*  It's about building on our triple alignment of values of interests and of trust, trust [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=451.68s)]
*  built over the years. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=457.04s)]
*  And so today, this is a new era of cooperation. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=459.02000000000004s)]
*  Our strategic Canada-EU or EU-Canada Strategic Partnership for the Future will build a new [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=463.72s)]
*  and deeper relationship that brings us closer together from defense to digital, from supply [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  chains to security. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=475.8s)]
*  We're launching comprehensive negotiations across multiple areas of cooperation, connection, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=478.6s)]
*  trade, security, digital, climate. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=485.6s)]
*  And this will make us both more resilient and more prosperous. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=488.84000000000003s)]
*  In many respects, what we're committing to from our perspective, Canada's perspective, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=494.40000000000003s)]
*  is an ongoing process to an ever closer partnership that will bring our people closer together. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=497.96000000000004s)]
*  And you have more from Prime Minister Carney here talking about shared values. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=505.8s)]
*  And you'll see this entire thing is Trump-coded about the United States disrespecting sovereignty [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=510.8s)]
*  and all of that here playing this clip. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=517.8000000000001s)]
*  We also in this more dangerous and divided world must be prepared to defend our people [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=519.32s)]
*  and our values, to secure our sovereignty and protect our allies. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=524.88s)]
*  And to these ends, we will be in The Hague tomorrow with new commitments, significant [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=528.36s)]
*  commitments to our own and our mutual defense, meeting our NATO targets, further accelerating [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=536.64s)]
*  investments in coming years. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=542.76s)]
*  But doing so, the EU and Canada, with this new security and defense partnership, which [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=545.52s)]
*  provides for this increased cooperation across the full spectrum of security, it will help [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=553.52s)]
*  us deliver on our new requirements for capabilities more rapidly and more effectively. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=559.84s)]
*  We'll help build our industries, secure our jurisdictions. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=568.68s)]
*  So we are very pleased to be taking this important step towards participation in SAFE as part [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=574.54s)]
*  of Rearm Readiness Europe, bringing shared expertise, joint research and innovation. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=581.74s)]
*  At its core, final word, Europe was born as a project of peace. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=592.3s)]
*  And Canada over the years, over the decades, has served alongside European allies in pursuit [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=600.18s)]
*  of that peace. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=606.9s)]
*  It's that in those circumstances, from Vimy to Juneau, that the world came to know the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=608.66s)]
*  value of our strength. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=615.38s)]
*  But now we're working alongside the European Union to combat climate change, to achieve [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=617.98s)]
*  the sustainable development goals, and to protect, amongst other things, academic and [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=625.06s)]
*  scientific freedoms. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=630.62s)]
*  In these ways, the world knows the strength of our values. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=633.28s)]
*  And this partnership, which is defense and security and economics, really builds the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=638.18s)]
*  strength, builds those strengths in both our jurisdictions and lives up to our values. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=645.18s)]
*  So with that, thank you for the partnership. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=652.18s)]
*  It's not over. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=654.66s)]
*  As you say, we have dinner. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=655.66s)]
*  And I know in Europe dinners are long and involve a lot of work, at least when they're [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=656.66s)]
*  in this building. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=663.0799999999999s)]
*  Other dinners in Europe are long and involve very little work, but this one will involve [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=664.94s)]
*  a lot of work, but so be it because we have a lot of work to do. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=668.22s)]
*  So with that, I'll hand back for questions. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=671.1800000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=673.1400000000001s)]
*  Then you had European Council President Antonio Costa. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=674.1400000000001s)]
*  He spoke and here's what he had to say. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=677.74s)]
*  And again, this is clearly directed at Trump. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=680.94s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=682.98s)]
*  Together, we continue to uphold the values that unite us at the time when the rules-based [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=683.98s)]
*  international order is under pressure. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=690.7800000000001s)]
*  When multilateralism is under attack, the European Union and Canada stand out as responsible, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=694.42s)]
*  predictable and reliable partners. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=702.5s)]
*  Here's a longer portion of that speech. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=705.26s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=707.14s)]
*  Our 20th summit is much more than a symbolic milestone. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=708.14s)]
*  It is a powerful political statement. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=714.62s)]
*  The European Union and Canada are among the closest allies in the transatlantic space. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=717.86s)]
*  We see the world through the similar lens and we stand for the same values. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=725.02s)]
*  We have always stood by each other and we will continue to do so. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=732.74s)]
*  Building upon these very solid foundations, we have agreed to forge even stronger bonds [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=739.24s)]
*  With the support of the 27 member states, we will take our strategic relationship to [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=746.9s)]
*  an unprecedented level of closeness. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=753.4599999999999s)]
*  That's why today marks a turning point in our history. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=757.78s)]
*  First on defense, we have just signed the European Union-Canada Security Defense Partnership. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=763.1s)]
*  It is a reflection of our mutual commitment to peace, transatlantic security and deeper [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=769.4599999999999s)]
*  cooperation in building defense capabilities. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=776.1s)]
*  It opens new opportunities for companies on both sides of that landing. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=779.34s)]
*  While NATO remains the cornerstone of our collective defense, this partnership will [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=784.98s)]
*  allow us to strengthen our preparedness faster and better, to invest more and to invest smarter. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=791.46s)]
*  On the economic front, we agreed to expand our trade flows and promote our economic security. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=802.18s)]
*  Thanks to the comprehensive economic and trade agreement, since 2017, bilateral trades in [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=809.8599999999999s)]
*  goods and services has charged by 71%, demonstrating the tangible benefits of our free trade agreement [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=818.0999999999999s)]
*  for citizens and businesses alike. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=828.38s)]
*  NATO belongs to a new generation of trade deals. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=832.74s)]
*  It protects workers, preserves the environment and safeguards our trade marks. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=836.3s)]
*  Now we are working on expanding this relationship and broadening our cooperation. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=843.3s)]
*  Our new joint agenda will allow us to work more closely in the fields of digital trade, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=850.26s)]
*  energy security, labor mobility and the supply of critical raw materials. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=857.62s)]
*  We will join forces in the global race for artificial intelligence and other breakthrough [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=864.06s)]
*  technologies. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=870.9s)]
*  And we will also foster people-to-people ties and promote exchanges in education and innovation [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=872.4s)]
*  while firmly defending academic freedom. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=879.38s)]
*  Together, we will fight climate change. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=883.3399999999999s)]
*  Global problems require global collaboration. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=888.0999999999999s)]
*  And the European Union and Canada can rely on each other. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=892.06s)]
*  Our prosperity is underlinked and together we are stronger. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=898.14s)]
*  Let me tell you, if there's a surefire way to wake up feeling fresh after drinks with [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=903.14s)]
*  friends, it's with pre-alcohol. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=907.14s)]
*  Z-Biotics pre-alcohol probiotic drink is the world's first genetically engineered probiotic. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=908.98s)]
*  It was invented by PhD scientists to tackle rough mornings after drinking. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=914.6999999999999s)]
*  Here's how it works. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=918.78s)]
*  When you drink, alcohol gets converted into a toxic byproduct in the gut. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=920.22s)]
*  It's a buildup of this byproduct, not dehydration, that's to blame for rough days after drinking. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=924.58s)]
*  Pre-alcohol produces an enzyme to break this byproduct down. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=931.66s)]
*  Just remember to make pre-alcohol your first drink of the night, drink responsibly, and [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=936.1s)]
*  you'll feel your best tomorrow. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=940.58s)]
*  Every time I've had pre-alcohol before drinks, I notice a difference the next day. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=943.38s)]
*  Even after a night out, I can confidently plan on just waking up and feeling my best [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=947.78s)]
*  the next day without worrying. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=951.62s)]
*  Look I won't lie, I was a bit on the fence about pre-alcohol initially, but then while [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=953.62s)]
*  hanging out with some friends at our bar, I gave it a shot and believe me, it's the [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=957.5s)]
*  real deal. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=961.38s)]
*  So I first gave pre-alcohol a try when I was at a wedding, I drank it before my first espresso [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=962.6999999999999s)]
*  martini and you wouldn't believe how on top of my game I felt the next morning. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=967.54s)]
*  Summer's here, which means more opportunities to celebrate the warm weather. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=972.3399999999999s)]
*  Before that backyard barbecue brew, or your glass of pino watching the sunset at a beach [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=976.78s)]
*  or a cocktail by the campfire, don't forget your Z-biotics pre-alcohol. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=982.26s)]
*  Drink one before drinking and wake up feeling great and ready to take on the next day and [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=987.9s)]
*  all that summer has to offer. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=992.86s)]

*  Sit down with Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen play this clip. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1025.74s)]
*  Thanks and congratulations for your posting of the G7. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1033.34s)]
*  Here's another clip from that meeting right here. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1038.34s)]
*  We discussed at the G7 what we have worked on over the years into practice with the Security [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1069.3s)]
*  and Defense Partnership. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1074.62s)]
*  Ursula, dear Ursula, it's crucial. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1076.1s)]
*  It's crucial for Canada, but I think it also shows a way forward to the world. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1078.5s)]
*  And the breadth of the ambition, but also the practical implementation of our partnership [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1084.34s)]
*  for the future is fundamental to the future of Canada. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1092.3799999999999s)]
*  And if I may, if I might put it in one direction, of course, the Union is under your leadership, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1097.82s)]
*  it has been moving to an ever closer Union. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1104.26s)]
*  We look forward to moving to an ever closer partnership with the European Union. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1107.34s)]
*  Here's what Ursula van der Leyen had to say during her portion of the speech. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1111.86s)]
*  And again, this is all anti-Trump coded right now, play this clip. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1116.22s)]
*  You have indeed a vast country and I'm happy to see more of it. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1121.1s)]
*  Same goes for you, Antonio. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1126.0s)]
*  So we'll be back and we're very curious to see where you will lead us to perhaps to the [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1127.42s)]
*  Arctic, which is so important to both of us and where we have been so clear about the [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1131.4s)]
*  EU support to our Greenlandic partners. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1138.0s)]
*  Dear Mark, you took the helm of the G7 presidency in challenging times and you delivered. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1140.84s)]
*  You brought countries together at a moment when unity is more vital than ever. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1149.28s)]
*  You helped bring focus to pressing issues and courage, frank exchange. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1155.32s)]
*  And you said at this moment, we have to turn the many challenges into change. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1161.48s)]
*  That is what we are doing today as we meet here in Brussels. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1168.1799999999998s)]
*  As the saying goes, hard times reveal true friends. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1173.1599999999999s)]
*  In these challenging times, we're taking huge steps forward to deepen our strategic partnership. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1178.32s)]
*  Let me start with defense. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1184.3999999999999s)]
*  Canada and the European Union have been working closely on this for years, both bilaterally [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1186.9199999999998s)]
*  and in NATO. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1192.78s)]
*  Canada has been leading NATO's enhanced forward presence in Latvia since 2014. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1195.12s)]
*  You're making Europe's Eastern flank stronger and safer. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1202.12s)]
*  And today we're stepping up our cooperation. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1206.7199999999998s)]
*  As you said, we signed a security and defense partnership. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1211.2s)]
*  It will strengthen Canada's role in Europe's rapidly evolving defense architecture. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1214.8s)]
*  And it's just the beginning. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1221.16s)]
*  We will now swiftly launch talks on Canada's access to a joint military procurement instrument [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1223.0s)]
*  we call it SAFE. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1230.68s)]
*  It's 150 billion euros. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1231.68s)]
*  Together we will define where our cooperation can have the most value added and where we [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1236.32s)]
*  should channel joint investments. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1242.52s)]
*  It will be good for our industries. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1244.08s)]
*  It will be good for our people. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1246.3999999999999s)]
*  And it will be good for the transatlantic security too. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1248.08s)]
*  And of course, it will be good for our continued support to Ukraine because the more we invest [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1251.84s)]
*  in the highly innovative Ukrainian industry, the more the industry will be capable and [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1258.5s)]
*  the better Ukraine can defend itself. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1265.84s)]
*  Dear Mark, Canada has shown incredible generosity to Ukraine, training almost 45,000 troops, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1268.84s)]
*  welcoming the refugees. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1279.84s)]
*  Today Ukraine needs our support more than ever. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1282.08s)]
*  And you made it clear in Kananaskis last week, we are determined to explore further sanctions [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1285.48s)]
*  to maximize pressure on Russia to come to the negotiation table. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1292.16s)]
*  So far the European Union and its member states have mobilized almost 150 billion euros. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1297.78s)]
*  The friends of Ukraine, all of us, we must now plan for more support for 2026 and beyond. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1303.94s)]
*  And of course, our focus is turned to the Ukrainian Recovery Conference in Rome in July. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1311.02s)]
*  And as a key member of our donor platform, Canada is contributing significant financial [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1318.18s)]
*  support to Ukraine, crucial assistance for reconstruction projects, as well as invaluable [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1323.8600000000001s)]
*  technical assistance. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1331.54s)]
*  In Kananaskis, we also discussed the importance of open, stable and free trade among partners. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1334.74s)]
*  It's a powerful foundation of our prosperity. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1341.8600000000001s)]
*  CETA is our shared success story that illustrates this perfectly. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1345.54s)]
*  And indeed, Antonio, you mentioned the 17% increase in trade since 2017 in numbers. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1351.78s)]
*  It is in 2023 alone, total trade reached an impressive 123 billion euros. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1362.18s)]
*  And thanks to CETA, the EU's GDP grow by 3.2 billion, while Canada sees a 1.3 billion euro [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1370.2600000000002s)]
*  boost each year. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1376.98s)]
*  So CETA stands as strong symbol of the power of free and fair trade. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1379.42s)]
*  I must say 98% of our tariffs line are zero. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1386.3400000000001s)]
*  I repeated zero. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1391.2600000000002s)]
*  We know that the ratification process is still ongoing, but we are committed to get this [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1394.46s)]
*  done. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1399.5s)]
*  And then finally, I have to share with you my friend, Charlie Angus. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1400.5s)]
*  Maple Midas through and through. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1405.02s)]
*  Charlie Angus has become one of my best friends in the fight for democracy. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1406.8200000000002s)]
*  You've seen him here. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1414.18s)]
*  I always hear you saying, show more Charlie Angus. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1415.18s)]
*  Here was Charlie Angus' take on the US striking Iran. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1418.8200000000002s)]
*  And he gave this take before Trump's fake ceasefire and before we found out that Donald Trump [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1423.8200000000002s)]
*  basically lied about all of the, that lied that the nuclear facilities were destroyed. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1430.6200000000001s)]
*  You'll see how Charlie Angus addressed this issue here. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1438.0200000000002s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1441.3000000000002s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu looks like he's sitting on top of the world. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1442.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, actually, he's sitting on top of a pile of bones, bombed out hospitals, thousands [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1444.46s)]
*  of dead Palestinian children and a Middle East that is now on fire. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1449.46s)]
*  Netanyahu has used the forever war as a means of staying ahead of the corruption courts, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1454.5s)]
*  and he's just managed to sucker the United States into providing him cover. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1460.3000000000002s)]
*  So no doubt he's feeling pretty good right now. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1464.54s)]
*  There was no Iranian nuclear threat. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1467.54s)]
*  American Intel told the president there was no Iranian threat. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1470.42s)]
*  Yes, that Telsie Gabbard, the queen of mega misinformation, testified there was no Iranian [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1475.82s)]
*  threat. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1482.06s)]
*  And just recently in a very telling statement at Hiroshima, Ms. Gabbard stated, quote, political [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1483.06s)]
*  elites and warmongers are carelessly fomenting fear and tension between the nuclear powers. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1488.9799999999998s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump didn't like that. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1494.3799999999999s)]
*  But just this past March, it was actually thought that Donald Trump might be the guy [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1496.9799999999998s)]
*  to bring the Iranian regime in from the cold. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1501.54s)]
*  That was when there was negotiations and diplomatic means between Tehran and Saudi [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1504.92s)]
*  Arabia as an American proxy, where they were talking about lifting the sanctions on Iran [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1510.28s)]
*  as an act of goodwill to deescalate the nuclear program and bring Iran to the table. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1515.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump was thought he could be the guy to do it because, hey, he really wanted. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1520.64s)]
*  Well, he wanted then the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1524.6000000000001s)]
*  But he'd also said he never supported foreign wars. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1527.64s)]
*  So maybe Donald Trump was the guy to make that happen. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1530.4s)]
*  But Benjamin Netanyahu was going to make sure that Trump was not going to deliver. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1533.68s)]
*  Netanyahu stated immediately that the terms of conditions for Iran coming to the table [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1539.52s)]
*  would be regime change. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1545.88s)]
*  Now, think about this. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1547.6000000000001s)]
*  Iran is not just a country. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1549.72s)]
*  It's one of the world's oldest civilizations. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1551.0800000000002s)]
*  It's a country of 90 million people sitting on the third largest oil reserves in the world, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1553.1200000000001s)]
*  the second largest natural gas reserves in the world. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1559.3600000000001s)]
*  The idea that Tehran could be forced into regime change because Israel dropped some [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1562.08s)]
*  bombs on the city was just ridiculous. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1566.92s)]
*  So what Netanyahu had to do is he had to sucker in the gangster from Mar-a-Lago. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1569.92s)]
*  And hey, that's not all that hard. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1575.28s)]
*  Like let's face it, Trump hasn't been doing very well recently. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1578.2s)]
*  People are accusing him of tacoing every time he has to deal with something. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1582.12s)]
*  So why not start a war in the Middle East, change the channel again? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1586.28s)]
*  But the real danger here is that now Trump has gone all in. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1590.68s)]
*  He's been using escalating language like demanding unconditional surrender. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1594.2s)]
*  That's very particular kind of military term. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1598.88s)]
*  It was used against Japan in the Second World War, which resulted in the dropping of the [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1601.04s)]
*  atom bomb. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1605.2s)]
*  We're in very dangerous times, my friend. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1607.4s)]
*  So where do we stand right now? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1610.68s)]
*  Well, let's look at Donald Trump. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1612.6000000000001s)]
*  As president, the chump got totally played. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1615.3200000000002s)]
*  He has damaged his credibility with his base. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1618.84s)]
*  He has damaged his credibility on the world stage. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1621.48s)]
*  Does he back up or does he go further? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1624.44s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1627.0s)]
*  Now what about Israel? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1628.76s)]
*  Well, Israel has become more and more isolated on the world stage. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1630.56s)]
*  Netanyahu is an indicted war criminal. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1635.96s)]
*  They are being investigated rightly for crimes of mass genocide against the Palestinian people. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1639.76s)]
*  So right now Netanyahu thinks he's got all the cards in his hand, but what he's done [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1646.64s)]
*  is he's left Israel and a dangerously isolated outlier. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1650.3200000000002s)]
*  And the long term implications for Israel and Israeli people, I don't think are all [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1656.2s)]
*  that good. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1660.3600000000001s)]
*  Now what about the West? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1661.44s)]
*  Well, it can be said that the credibility of Western moral superiority died in the death [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1662.8400000000001s)]
*  camp that is Gaza. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1670.0s)]
*  We all watched the starving children. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1672.3200000000002s)]
*  We watched the targeting of the hospitals. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1674.92s)]
*  We watched the targeting of aid workers. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1677.1200000000001s)]
*  And we saw our Western leaders say nothing or tiptoe around it. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1679.24s)]
*  And what that did was that gave Netanyahu the green light to go further. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1684.4s)]
*  So are we going to see the Western allies standing up and rallying the world at this [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1690.4s)]
*  time to try and de-escalate? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1695.4s)]
*  They just don't seem to have the credibility. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1697.8000000000002s)]
*  I really hope our Prime Minister, Mark Carney, who's demanded and called for people coming [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1700.3999999999999s)]
*  back to the table, I wish him well, but I think the West has really damaged itself at [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1705.24s)]
*  this moment. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1710.24s)]
*  And then there's Iran. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1712.08s)]
*  I don't know what the regime in Iran is going to do, but I think the one lesson is, is it [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1715.12s)]
*  giving up a nuclear option when you're facing these kind of threats of regime change is [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1720.6s)]
*  not something they're going to do. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1724.8999999999999s)]
*  So if they weren't going to go nuclear before, they're probably going to go nuclear now. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1726.82s)]
*  And that's the world we're in right now. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1731.3s)]
*  The world is on fire. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1733.78s)]
*  And we have the dangerous president, the gangster from Mar-a-Lago, pouring gasoline all over [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqNnRu6JIg&t=1736.1s)]
