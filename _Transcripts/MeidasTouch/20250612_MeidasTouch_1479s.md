# FURIOUS Asia STRIKES BACK at Trump when HE LEAST EXPECTED
**MeidasTouch:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU)
*  Asia as a whole is furious at the United States and kind of mocking the US as well. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=0.0s)]
*  And I think they're just really pissed at what the United States has become under Donald [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=8.56s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=11.76s)]
*  Let's just take a look, for example, in Japan, where Prime Minister Ashiba is saying that, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=12.76s)]
*  look, I know that Donald Trump's saying all these things out here, but we're not going [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  to forgo Japan's interests just to do some quick trade deal that Donald Trump can make [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=22.54s)]
*  social media posts about. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=28.46s)]
*  He goes, look, if there's progress before I meet, that's good. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=30.060000000000002s)]
*  But what's important is to achieve an agreement that's beneficial to both Japan and the US. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=34.42s)]
*  We're not going to compromise Japan's interest just because the US wants to make a quick [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=39.34s)]
*  deal. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=46.14s)]
*  So you have that going on there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=47.14s)]
*  Then you have in China, Donald Trump is claiming that he's now done another deal, but it's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=48.82s)]
*  not a deal. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=56.1s)]
*  It's actually a framework regarding a consensus that was reached on May 12th, which was really [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=57.86s)]
*  just the United States caving and moving the tariffs from 145% against China to 35%. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=63.38s)]
*  But it's really 55%. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=70.34s)]
*  And then China set a deadline on the United States. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=73.02s)]
*  Just think about this as part of this consensus. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  China sets the deadline, a six-month limit on its ease of rare earth export licenses [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=79.98s)]
*  for rare earth minerals. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=86.66000000000001s)]
*  So Trump's idea of a good deal is that we were getting rare earth minerals from China [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=88.14s)]
*  and we were having a trade relationship with them before Donald Trump declared a trade [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=92.18s)]
*  war against the world. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=96.54s)]
*  And now Donald Trump's taxing Americans 55% in the forms of tariffs against China. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=97.78s)]
*  China's tariffing its own people only 10%. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=102.54s)]
*  And now we have a six-month time limitation on rare earth minerals coming into the US [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=105.42s)]
*  that was coming in before. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=110.5s)]
*  So it's not a shocker that the US image is declining in many nations, especially in Asia. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=112.22s)]
*  If you look at the latest Pew Research poll, for example, in Japan, low to zero confidence [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=117.98s)]
*  of the United States, 61% of the population with Donald Trump leading the US have a low [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=123.46s)]
*  to no confidence of the US. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=129.3s)]
*  In South Korea, it's even higher. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=131.1s)]
*  67% have low to zero confidence. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=133.62s)]
*  You have op-eds like this in Politico. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=137.9s)]
*  When I saw one in the Wall Street Journal as well. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  In Wall Street Journal, it was Trump has no China strategy. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=142.78s)]
*  In Politico, it was Trump's latest trade deal with China underscores key US disadvantage. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=146.94s)]
*  Then meanwhile, you have Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick going on and bragging [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=152.82s)]
*  about having KFC with the Chinese. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=157.18s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=160.14000000000001s)]
*  But I want you to know, for lunch, for lunch, we had British pizza and they ordered Kentucky [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=161.14000000000001s)]
*  Fried Chicken. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=167.46s)]
*  So, Mr. Secretary, you after spending. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=169.57999999999998s)]
*  Let's bring in Rahm Emanuel, former ambassador to Japan, former chief of staff to former [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=172.06s)]
*  President Obama. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=177.34s)]
*  As the former ambassador to Japan, you must have a lot of thoughts about this. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=180.22s)]
*  I want to pick your brain on that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  Then I want to go talk about the larger trade war situation that's taken place in your views. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=185.06s)]
*  You and I spoke about two months ago on this topic, so it's a good time for an update. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=190.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=195.18s)]
*  Let's do economics Asia and let's do national security Asia because I think there's something [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=196.5s)]
*  important and they because I can just tell you from my time in Japan, those two weave [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=202.18s)]
*  in and out of each other through the process. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=207.86s)]
*  Three things that have caught my attention, four things caught my attention on the national [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=211.62s)]
*  security front. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=215.22s)]
*  A couple of months ago, China did an exercise live, ammunition exercise off of Sydney for [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=216.22s)]
*  the first time ever and that close to Sydney to the point that it impacted civil aviation [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=224.94s)]
*  and that was a message sent. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=231.34s)]
*  Second, just the other day near Japan, they came within I think 300 feet in aviation with [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=233.3s)]
*  their jet versus a C-130 that Japan was flying in a way that Japan had not seen and had done [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=241.54s)]
*  certain things around the Senkaku Islands, both countries claim, but also had something [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=247.66s)]
*  that had not been seen before. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=253.9s)]
*  Also in the South China Sea, the Philippines and the Spratly Islands, China had a much [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=258.7s)]
*  more aggressive posture and Secretary of Defense Hegseth was in Singapore at the Shangri-La [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=263.9s)]
*  Defense and Security Conference and he gives an entire speech in which he doesn't really [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=272.9s)]
*  mention Korea. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=280.42s)]
*  China reminds you of Dean Acheson's absence of mentioning Korea and there is some open [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=282.42s)]
*  discussion in that area about America pulling some troops out of Korea. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=290.22s)]
*  And then lastly, the United States is reviewing the agreement we have between Great Britain, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=296.02000000000004s)]
*  Australia and the United States on submarine production. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=300.22s)]
*  It's called AUKUS and you look at all of these events, call it in a 60-day period, you have [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=305.46s)]
*  a much more aggressive China and a much more retreating, unsure America which is destabilizing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=316.29999999999995s)]
*  the confidence of an Australia, a South Korea, a Japan or a Philippines or traditional allies [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=324.21999999999997s)]
*  and not just allies, how America projects deterrence in the region. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=330.7s)]
*  Split screen, that's on the left side, on the right side of the screen, economics. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=336.7s)]
*  One word caught me in what the Japanese, who are the largest buyers of American bonds by [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=341.9s)]
*  a foreign government, the largest investor in the United States, four consecutive years [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=346.7s)]
*  of which nearly half of their investments are in manufacturing and in industrial, they [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=354.7s)]
*  said we're not going to do a quick deal. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=360.22s)]
*  And the key word, not deal, the key word there is quick. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=363.02000000000004s)]
*  Every foreign government now, Japan and China also, know that the president is desperate [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=367.62s)]
*  for quick deal, just a press release, don't care what the substance is, it's an announcement, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=374.98s)]
*  just as the president just showed with China. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=380.66s)]
*  Everybody understands now on the quote unquote tariffs, all you have to do is be patient [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=384.1s)]
*  because the president is impulsive and all he cares about is a press release, doesn't [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=391.1s)]
*  really care what's in the press release, doesn't care whether America wins or loses just as [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=396.3s)]
*  long as he looks like a winner. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=400.22s)]
*  And so they have his number and they know how to use his desire for a quick hit to their [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=402.22s)]
*  advantage and our disadvantage. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=410.9s)]
*  And that's going to be a problem on a whole host of fronts and already is and I think [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=413.61999999999995s)]
*  you saw this as you said in the tariff discussion with China, we don't really have a trade deal, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=419.41999999999996s)]
*  this idea that there's a deal. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=427.65999999999997s)]
*  We have a problem economically with China. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=431.58s)]
*  They always practice economic coercion and they're doing it on critical minerals now [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=434.65999999999997s)]
*  against the United States just like they did in 2010 against Japan. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=438.62s)]
*  Two they're aggressively involved in intellectual property theft and stealing of ideas as you [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=443.26s)]
*  saw with Google on around AI about a year ago. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=448.9s)]
*  They involve themselves with economic espionage and they're aggressive mercantilists using [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=453.02s)]
*  their very little domestic demand, massive manufacturing, underwriting cheap exports [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=458.22s)]
*  so they could destroy another country's steel or another country's autos or another country's [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=467.94s)]
*  tech, you know, toy business, garment industry, etc. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=472.46000000000004s)]
*  And all that is in place. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=477.78000000000003s)]
*  President's done nothing. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=480.82s)]
*  And he because of his impulsiveness and he said it in his own little tweet, this will [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=483.54s)]
*  be decided between Xi and I, we're going to agree to it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=488.22s)]
*  He wanted to look like a strong man in his desire to curry favor with Xi and they're [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=490.98s)]
*  laughing all the way in Beijing. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=496.02000000000004s)]
*  We didn't get we didn't get anything on economic coercion. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=498.90000000000003s)]
*  We're going to be continue to be a victim of it because China said, oh, we're not giving [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=502.1s)]
*  you critical minerals. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=506.94s)]
*  We're going to do it every six months. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=507.94s)]
*  Magnets to we've had no impact on their intellectual property theft, no impact on their mercantilism, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=510.06s)]
*  no impact on their economic espionage. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=517.34s)]
*  And all our allies are watching how China, in my view, cleaned our clock. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=519.86s)]
*  And there was a story today and I'll just stop here where everybody who's applying to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=524.6999999999999s)]
*  get these now magnets out of China are saying they're asking incredibly detailed reports [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=530.3399999999999s)]
*  as you submit your application about who the end user is, how you're using them, what do [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=537.8199999999999s)]
*  you want. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=542.3399999999999s)]
*  And that's another form of economic espionage. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=543.3399999999999s)]
*  And it's all left in place. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=545.9399999999999s)]
*  These guys are the worst negotiators because all they wanted to produce was a press release [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=549.54s)]
*  not an economic plan. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=554.9s)]
*  To your point, also, because he wants to project being a strong man while actually also being [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=556.8199999999999s)]
*  very weak and damaging to this country here on the domestic front. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=564.66s)]
*  And we've seen over the past week, what many thought was unthinkable. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=569.14s)]
*  And I want to get your thoughts on it with Trump federalizing the National Guard, calling [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=572.5s)]
*  the Marines as well. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=577.9s)]
*  By the way, not paying the National Guard, not activating their health care, because [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=580.26s)]
*  once again, he did it in such a mess. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=585.26s)]
*  We learned that from military.com. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=586.86s)]
*  They're sleeping on the floor. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=589.1800000000001s)]
*  They're guarding a federal building. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=591.1800000000001s)]
*  The chief of L.A. or the LAPD chief and the L.A. sheriff's department are saying, we don't [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=592.62s)]
*  even know why they're here or really what they're even doing. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=597.94s)]
*  We have to shift our resources basically to watch them now. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=601.7s)]
*  So you have that taking place. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=606.38s)]
*  By the way, more troops now in Los Angeles than in Iraq and Syria and probably a lot [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=607.74s)]
*  of other countries abroad. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=612.22s)]
*  And then you have this dictator parade that Donald Trump is holding for himself this weekend [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=614.58s)]
*  on the 250th anniversary of the army, making it about himself. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=620.5s)]
*  I know you must have strong thoughts about all of that. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=625.1s)]
*  So let me start on the back end. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=628.22s)]
*  I think it's very telling and really wrong on so many levels. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=631.38s)]
*  Here you have the 250 year anniversary of the United States Army. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=637.58s)]
*  General Washington, General Grant, General Eisenhower, just to name three who became [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=643.7800000000001s)]
*  presidents, Omar Bradley, Patton. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=650.62s)]
*  And I'm leaving many, many others out that with. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=653.82s)]
*  But you get the point. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=658.26s)]
*  And rather making it about those individuals and everybody who makes up that 250 year family. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=659.62s)]
*  Of service to the country, to the Constitution and to the ideals of the United States. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=667.7s)]
*  Donald Trump's decided to make it about the most important person in his view, Donald Trump. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=673.98s)]
*  He's literally sabotaged this anniversary where America could remember what the army [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=678.9s)]
*  has served, not only about serving your country, but serving its ideals. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=688.02s)]
*  And I think it's telling on also the anniversary, although it's a different branch of the armed [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=694.62s)]
*  forces with the Marines, that he is also breaking precedent by using the armed forces on American soil. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=700.5s)]
*  And so I think it's that last point is incredibly telling that Donald Trump's ego, rather than [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=711.3000000000001s)]
*  being selfless as the president of the United States and the commander in chief, holding [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=722.42s)]
*  up the army and what it has done through generation to generation to generation, chapter after [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=727.8199999999999s)]
*  chapter of American history in service of something bigger. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=734.42s)]
*  He's made it about himself. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=740.62s)]
*  And to me, that tells you the story of Donald Trump. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=742.02s)]
*  But it doesn't tell you the story of America. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=745.86s)]
*  And that story still has to be told and reminded. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=747.98s)]
*  Second, I think what's going on, I have like a hundred things about LA. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=750.9s)]
*  You know, you're not, I'll just start in the back end. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=756.9s)]
*  You're not going to solve the issue or the challenge of immigration on the streets of [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=763.38s)]
*  Los Angeles, Chicago, Spokane, Washington, or Seattle or New York. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=768.4599999999999s)]
*  We're going to solve it in the halls of Congress. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=773.14s)]
*  And the one thing the president has refused to do is engage Congress on how to resolve [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=776.26s)]
*  this. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=780.42s)]
*  Now, 1988, Ronald Reagan signs immigration. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=781.42s)]
*  By the time Bill Clinton comes along, also a little Bush 41, but every president since [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=785.9399999999999s)]
*  Bill Clinton has tried to figure out because immigration has changed how to handle both [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=793.54s)]
*  being true to the fact that America is a nation of laws and America is a nation of [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=801.06s)]
*  immigrants. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=806.54s)]
*  Those are the guiding principles. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=807.54s)]
*  Bill Clinton deported criminal immigrants or immigrants with criminal records. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=809.78s)]
*  We as somebody is a point person, we had Operation Gatekeeper in San Diego, Operation Safeguard [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=816.54s)]
*  in Nogales, Arizona of how to strengthen the border. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=821.8599999999999s)]
*  George Bush had his own manifestations. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=827.38s)]
*  President Obama created DACA for dreamers, but he also was protested when he was seen [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=830.5s)]
*  as the deporter in chief at public events. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=835.58s)]
*  He was protested. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=838.42s)]
*  So he was tough also about illegal immigrants, et cetera. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=839.66s)]
*  And everybody's tried to figure out how to manage through the fact that we don't have [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=843.78s)]
*  an immigration process around illegal and around legal. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=848.58s)]
*  And the irony of this to me is as a student of the politics around immigration reform, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=853.38s)]
*  somebody through my mayoral tenure, chief of staff, Congress, and down to President [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=860.42s)]
*  Clinton's senior advisor. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=867.18s)]
*  Today Democrats are much closer to Republicans on how to confront illegal immigration and [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=869.26s)]
*  the border than they have been in the last 15 years since Ted Kennedy and John McCain [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=875.9s)]
*  had a bipartisan bill in the Senate. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=883.74s)]
*  Truth be told, you can see it because Steve Bannon attacked Elon Musk about this, et cetera. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=887.9s)]
*  There are strong elements and even the president says this, we need to update our legal immigration. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=892.9799999999999s)]
*  So they, the Republicans, if you may say, have moved closer to where I think there's [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=898.18s)]
*  a consensus on how to modernize our legal immigration. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=904.42s)]
*  And leadership would be the president calling everybody down and say, okay, here's the principles. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=908.5s)]
*  Let's go deal with this and answer this. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=914.26s)]
*  What does the president do? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=916.54s)]
*  They were in search of a confrontation. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=917.8199999999999s)]
*  They wanted this confrontation in LA. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=921.6999999999999s)]
*  And that's not an immigration policy for the United States. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=925.0999999999999s)]
*  Both one that honors the fact that we're a nation of laws and we're a nation of immigrants [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=932.78s)]
*  is going to be found in the halls of Congress. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=937.26s)]
*  Presidents have contorted themselves trying to figure this out and never really getting [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=940.14s)]
*  legislation. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=944.66s)]
*  Governors are doing it. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=946.02s)]
*  You can see with Governor Abbott, you can see with Governor Newsom, you can see it with [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=947.02s)]
*  Governor here, Pritzker. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=949.62s)]
*  Cities have contorted themselves with welcoming sanctuary facilities type of that. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=951.6999999999999s)]
*  Everybody's trying to work around a broken system. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=956.02s)]
*  Fix it. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=958.78s)]
*  Businesses, today I saw a story, the president said that he wants to take kind of the foot [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=959.78s)]
*  off the gas because businesses are complaining that they can't find immigrants to do the [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=966.1s)]
*  work that they need them for. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=970.42s)]
*  They have a labor problem. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=971.74s)]
*  Well, that was known before we did this in Los Angeles. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=973.78s)]
*  And you know, and I'll just say in Los Angeles, you have a protesting in America history is [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=977.4200000000001s)]
*  patriotic. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=983.1800000000001s)]
*  Provocation, violence is not. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=984.1800000000001s)]
*  You should be arrested and the law will find you and prosecute for that. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=987.74s)]
*  But a government also has a responsibility. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=992.6600000000001s)]
*  And that is to protect speech and not to provoke the idea that we're calling out Marines and [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=998.22s)]
*  the National Guard in ways that not only unprecedented, the court will decide at least as a National [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1005.1s)]
*  Guard whether it's illegal is insane when it's not about ruling. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1010.3000000000001s)]
*  Engage Congress and it's about governing something he's never done. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1017.62s)]
*  This can't be done by executive order. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1021.74s)]
*  We've talked about the foreign. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1023.78s)]
*  We've talked about the domestic in the present. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1025.5s)]
*  Now let's talk about where we go. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1029.14s)]
*  What's what's your plan? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1031.98s)]
*  How do you see we address this? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1033.8600000000001s)]
*  How do you see is this a vision for the future? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1036.74s)]
*  When you say this, you mean immigration or in large where America is and etc. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1041.9s)]
*  Oh, in large part where we are today, you know, both foreign policy, domestic and where [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1046.26s)]
*  we go more broadly. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1050.74s)]
*  Well, let me just start on a kind of a look in the take away from this moment, but step [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1053.78s)]
*  back and take a wider lens view. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1063.94s)]
*  Our politics becomes unstable at exactly around the same moment. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1067.54s)]
*  The American American dream becomes unaffordable. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1073.5s)]
*  They're interlocked. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1078.3799999999999s)]
*  And when exactly when the public both not only loses confidence that they can accept [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1079.7s)]
*  and have access to the American dream, but that the system is rigged. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1085.7800000000002s)]
*  All they want is a shot at the American dream. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1090.98s)]
*  They want their children to have a shot at the American dream, owning a home, saving [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1093.46s)]
*  for your retirement, your kids education and the ability to afford your health care. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1097.5s)]
*  The system and the public's right about this is rigged. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1103.18s)]
*  My kids are going to be fine. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1108.46s)]
*  But that's not how you score this. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1110.74s)]
*  That's not how we keep score. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1112.14s)]
*  Whether your kids or my kids are going to be fine. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1113.66s)]
*  That's whether the American dream is open to the American people, not open to a segment [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1115.66s)]
*  of the American people. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1119.3400000000001s)]
*  And it's crazy. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1121.3000000000002s)]
*  The ability to get a home first time home buyers. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1123.98s)]
*  You have people that were at the president's inaugural. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1126.5400000000002s)]
*  I would put myself. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1128.6200000000001s)]
*  I was at the inaugural. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1129.9s)]
*  I have Amy and I have more than one home, but we have people in America that can't get [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1131.5400000000002s)]
*  access and afford a single home. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1135.3000000000002s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1137.34s)]
*  The system is not written like that. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1138.34s)]
*  I grew up in a home. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1140.22s)]
*  My dad was a doctor. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1141.4199999999998s)]
*  My mother was a nurse. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1142.58s)]
*  When you said a second medical opinion, it was another health care professional was a [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1145.1799999999998s)]
*  summer insurance bureaucrat that tell you you can't have that procedure. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1148.6599999999999s)]
*  You can't have that medication that you have to go to bankruptcy for that. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1152.3799999999999s)]
*  This is it. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1156.4199999999998s)]
*  And people are using their 401k to backstop their paycheck rather than say for their retirement. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1157.4199999999998s)]
*  And this is crazy. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1163.98s)]
*  So to me, the American dream is unaffordable. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1165.1s)]
*  It's inaccessible to the American people. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1167.98s)]
*  And that's unacceptable to me. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1170.14s)]
*  And you're going to work like a dog to solve that. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1172.66s)]
*  And that means if you work for a living, you're going to finally have a government that works [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1175.34s)]
*  for you. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1179.38s)]
*  That's our pledge. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1181.38s)]
*  Second, I'm passionate about this. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1182.38s)]
*  But that education and I've kind of laid out, you know, you can't if you I don't mean to [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1187.02s)]
*  get theoretical or historical. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1191.94s)]
*  Every great period of American growth is anchored by education. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1194.46s)]
*  Every period making high school universal. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1199.98s)]
*  You see the growth in American economy, the GI bill growth in their economy. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1203.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean, land grant colleges under Lincoln growth. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1210.06s)]
*  Every great period of economic expansion in American history is anchored by making education [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1213.8200000000002s)]
*  more universal, more acceptable. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1221.18s)]
*  We have a crisis in this country. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1225.22s)]
*  We have a 30 year low in reading scores, 30 year low in math scores. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1227.38s)]
*  Covid was devastating, horrible what was happened and permitted to happen by adults. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1231.18s)]
*  I've laid out what I think what I call art attendance for a we have what used to be single [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1236.98s)]
*  digits three, four or five percent absentees over a year. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1246.38s)]
*  Kids are now running 18, 19 to 20 percent. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1251.5800000000002s)]
*  We should have a national standard. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1253.98s)]
*  If your if your absence is greater than five percent, you can't go to the next grade. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1255.66s)]
*  We need to reestablish the standard. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1261.1000000000001s)]
*  Be in school. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1263.3000000000002s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1264.7800000000002s)]
*  That's a R reading Mississippi. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1266.3400000000001s)]
*  This thing called the Mississippi miracle. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1271.5800000000002s)]
*  They just went back to the basics. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1273.22s)]
*  They spent more time on reading back to the basics of how to do it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1275.02s)]
*  None of this new kind of stuff that got got everybody sidetracked. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1277.8600000000001s)]
*  And Mississippi's showing incredible gains in reading starting in 2010 and among the [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1283.06s)]
*  most difficult communities. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1289.58s)]
*  Poor kids, black males, they're showing incredible growth, surpassing national numbers. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1294.06s)]
*  And then T for truth, which is B, go back to testing and letting parents and schools [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1300.74s)]
*  know how those kids are doing a reading math, etc. against national standards, not educating [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1310.06s)]
*  to the test, but having data so you know where you are and what you have to do to improve [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1315.82s)]
*  art. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1321.46s)]
*  Attendance, reading, truth. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1323.46s)]
*  And that to me would recalibrate now education back to the fundamentals. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1329.18s)]
*  And then third, I would say overseas, the United States needs to modernize its relationship [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1333.9s)]
*  with its allies and friends. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1344.5s)]
*  You're not going to confront Russia, China, Iran without allies. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1346.9s)]
*  And more importantly, just allies, allies picking their weight with a clear path to [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1354.38s)]
*  the strategy and the relationship between both security, defense spending and diplomacy. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1358.14s)]
*  And America, I still believe is an essential country that others want to follow, be partnered [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1366.26s)]
*  with, etc. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1376.66s)]
*  And then when I think both about my experience in both the Middle East, but also in Asia, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1377.98s)]
*  you're not going to deter China from California. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1384.94s)]
*  You're going to deter it because not only our resources in Japan, which is the largest [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1389.1000000000001s)]
*  military footprint the United States has overseas or Korea or Australia, you're going to deter [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1396.14s)]
*  it because of our forces anchored with other countries forces that want to be a part of [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1401.42s)]
*  it. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1405.98s)]
*  And that has a deterrent level as does the diplomatic efforts we do in the economic coordination. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1407.42s)]
*  And to me, that's kind of how I view it. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1413.42s)]
*  And if we strengthen ourselves at home, we will be incredibly strong abroad. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1416.98s)]
*  That's one of the things I say from my time in Japan. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1425.1000000000001s)]
*  I learned a lot about Japan, learned a lot about the Indo-Pacific. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1428.42s)]
*  But being away from America, I learned a lot about what's special about our country and [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1431.8200000000002s)]
*  how many other countries and publics see America as their benchmark and want to be associated [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1435.98s)]
*  with it. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1442.58s)]
*  And that is an incredible resource to draw. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1443.78s)]
*  I think that's what makes this time also very challenging when you see America, which used [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1446.86s)]
*  to be the benchmark being viewed differently. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1451.8999999999999s)]
*  But Ram, I want you to come back. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1454.82s)]
*  I want to talk about sure there's going to be a lot of developments coming up every single [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1456.22s)]
*  day. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1461.3799999999999s)]
*  We love having you on. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1462.3799999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much once again. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1463.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEu3GAUnUAU&t=1464.3799999999999s)]
