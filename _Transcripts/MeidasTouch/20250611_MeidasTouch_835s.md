# Trump LOSES CONTROL in AM after TERRIBLE NEWS
**MeidasTouch:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg)
*  As Donald Trump continues to look like a complete and utter fool, it's yet another morning of ranting and raving like a lunatic in all caps posts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=0.0s)]
*  And he's now saying that this consensus framework, whatever the heck you want to call it with China, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=11.32s)]
*  actually the United States is imposing 55% tariffs against China, and they are imposing only 10% tariffs against the US. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=18.28s)]
*  Donald Trump acts like that's a victory. Yay! We're taxing the American people 55%, basically making Chinese goods unaffordable to bring into the United States, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=29.48s)]
*  while China is smartly not taxing its own people. And didn't they say yesterday that it was going to be the same 30%? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=40.72s)]
*  Who even knows what the hell Trump is doing with these tariffs? Here's Trump's post, all caps. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  Our deal with China is done, subject to final approval with President Xi and me. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=55.56s)]
*  Pause there. It actually should be subject to final approval of Congress, who has the tariff power. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=61.080000000000005s)]
*  But let's be clear, Donald Trump is an idiotic dictator, and so this is what you'd expect him to say. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=67.8s)]
*  Full magnets and any necessary rare earths will be supplied upfront by China. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=74.08s)]
*  Pause there. That's what was taking place before you tariff the world. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=79.92s)]
*  I like that he goes, this is a victory. We're going to get what we were getting before the trade war against the world. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=85.16000000000001s)]
*  And then I caved because China withheld rare earth minerals, and then all of our technology companies were about to go bankrupt. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=92.2s)]
*  So we immediately had Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jameson Greer cave because Trump always chickens out. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=100.36s)]
*  Dude, you're claiming a victory for the status quo before your trade war. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  I mean, again, the international community is laughing in this idiot's face right now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  He goes on to say, Likewise, we will provide to China what was agreed to, including Chinese students using our colleges and universities, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  which has always been good with me! We've always been good with you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=129.88s)]
*  You were the one who tried to put an end to that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=134.6s)]
*  So again, the status quo, exactly what existed before the arsonists lit the world on fire and created chaos that is lingering and has jeopardized, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=136.72s)]
*  not even jeopardized, crushed the United States power in the world. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=146.56s)]
*  Then Trump goes, we are getting a total of 55 percent tariffs. China is getting 10 percent. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=150.44s)]
*  Relationship is excellent! Exclamation point. Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=155.56s)]
*  Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=160.6s)]
*  So the deal was reached in London was that our consumers and businesses now get to pay 55 percent taxes instead of 30 percent. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=163.6s)]
*  Then Donald Trump goes, Adding to the China readout, President Xi and I are going to work closely together to open up China to American trade. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=171.56s)]
*  This would be a great win for both countries. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=180.16s)]
*  Dude, China is open to American trade. What freaking world is this idiot living in? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=183.04s)]
*  China is open to American trade. Europe is open to American trade. We have free trade with the world. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=189.48s)]
*  I don't even know what era you are living in and your cognitively addled, malignant, narcissistic, idiotic lack of a brain of yours. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=195.12s)]
*  Then he posts this CPI talking about inflation CPI just out great numbers. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=203.88s)]
*  Fed should lower one full point, would pay much less interest on debt coming due. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=210.32s)]
*  So important! Exclamation point. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=215.24s)]
*  I like how he's celebrating the fact that inflation rose 2.4 percent in May on an annual basis. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  So it rose less than expected. The report was not as bad as people expected. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  So I guess baby Trump deserves a round of applause. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  Yay, it's not quite as bad as it expected. As we expected, it was going to be a big win for Donald. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=236.68s)]
*  Not as bad as expected. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  Let's take a look at what the Wall Street Journal previously said about this data. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=243.6s)]
*  So just so you know, this is what the Wall Street Journal said. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=247.0s)]
*  Economists raise questions about the quality of U.S. inflation data. Article June 4th. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=249.96s)]
*  Labor Department says staffing shortages reduced its ability to conduct its massive monthly survey. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=256.04s)]
*  OK, well, that's a data point. How about what JP Morgan says right here? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=262.16s)]
*  We still think it may be early to see signs of sizable pass through of tariffs into consumer prices [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=266.6s)]
*  and look for firmer readings by the summer months. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=273.96s)]
*  In other words, even though inflation is still rising, it's not rising as much as people expected. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=277.4s)]
*  We're going to be waiting for the summer months to really get a handle on what's going on. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=283.04s)]
*  And if you want to take a look at what another bank, Citigroup, is doing, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=287.8s)]
*  Citigroup is set to put aside hundreds of millions of dollars more than it did last quarter [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=291.56s)]
*  to account for potential losses on loans, an early sign that the biggest U.S. banks may be bracing [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=296.64s)]
*  for deteriorating economic health. Given the macro environment, et cetera, cost of credit compared to last quarter, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=303.32s)]
*  we expect to be up a few hundred million, says Citigroup's head of banking. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=310.68s)]
*  Now, what does Howard Lutnick, Donald Trump's scammy, they're all scammy, commerce secretary have to say? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  So when are you going to do these deals, Lutnick? You said there were going to be 90 deals in 90 days. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=326.44s)]
*  We're almost in July. The 90 days is up. You've done zero deals in 90 days. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=332.16s)]
*  So Nutlick, tell us Nutlick, what's the update? Play the clip. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=337.48s)]
*  You guys have set the deadline for early July to have more trade deals. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=342.68s)]
*  We're expecting more to come. What can you tell us about the progress of any of the ones you're working on? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=347.8s)]
*  We thought Japan, India were close. We got this framework from the UK. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=352.52s)]
*  But what else is in what else is coming there? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=356.68s)]
*  Oh, there was so many coming. But when you've got Scott Jameson and I spending, you know, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=359.2s)]
*  25 hours locked in a room with the Chinese, we're not really doing the other deals. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=364.2s)]
*  Yes, our teams are moving them forward. But, you know, now we're going to be focused starting today. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=369.2s)]
*  We're going to be focused on other deals. We're going to get them done. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=374.59999999999997s)]
*  We're in good shape with lots of countries, but good shape isn't good enough for the United States of America. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=378.47999999999996s)]
*  We want great deals that are fundamental for America. We can get them. We can get them done. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=384.52s)]
*  Dude, looks like the if I asked chat GPT, draw me a snake oil salesman and animate it, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=389.64s)]
*  it would be what I literally just showed you. We're doing so much deals. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=398.16s)]
*  The biggest beautiful deals you ever seen, the biggest beautiful deals ever. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=402.0s)]
*  There's going to be a deal today, a deal yesterday. You know how hard I worked. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=405.8s)]
*  I was negotiating with China. What did you negotiate with China? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=409.20000000000005s)]
*  Somewhat of the status quo regarding rare earth minerals before your trade war against the world. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  What a victory by Howard Ludnick. Yay for Donald Trump. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=419.64000000000004s)]
*  55% tax on Americans importing Chinese. What in the world are you even talking about? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=423.64s)]
*  By the way, Donald Trump was asked by this interviewer, this dropped earlier. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=430.08s)]
*  Are you going to arrest Gavin Newsom? Play this clip. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=435.08s)]
*  Are you going to arrest Gavin Newsom? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=438.88s)]
*  Well, he's not doing a good job. You know, arrest. What does that mean? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  He's not doing a good job. Charge him. Well, in theory, you could, I guess. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, it's almost like a dissipation of duty. Nobody's ever seen anything like that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=450.84s)]
*  As you know, I'm a dad and well, I've just been having the greatest time ever. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=455.67999999999995s)]
*  Here's the thing. I never knew just how important it was, what we give our children. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=459.56s)]
*  Typical children's vitamins are basically candy in disguise. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=463.76s)]
*  They're filled with two teaspoons of sugar, unhealthy chemicals and other gummy junk that growing kids should never eat. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=466.96s)]
*  That's why HIO was created. The pediatrician approved super power chewable vitamin. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=472.79999999999995s)]
*  Now, while most children's vitamins are filled with five grams of sugar and can contribute to a variety of health issues, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=478.24s)]
*  HIA is made with zero sugar and zero gummy junk. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=484.47999999999996s)]
*  Yet it tastes great and is perfect for picky eaters. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  HIA fills in the most important common gaps in modern children's diets to provide the full body nourishment that our kids need with a yummy taste that they love. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=491.48s)]
*  Formulated with the help of nutritional experts, HIA is pressed with a blend of 12 organic fruits and veggies, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=500.4s)]
*  then supercharged with 15 essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamin D, B12, C, zinc, folate and many others to help support immunity, energy, brain function, mood concentration, teeth, bones and more. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=507.20000000000005s)]
*  It's non GMO, vegan, dairy free, allergy free, gelatin free, nut free and everything else you can imagine. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=521.12s)]
*  HIA is designed for kids of all ages and sent straight to your door. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=528.0400000000001s)]
*  So parents have one less thing to worry about. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=531.64s)]
*  Like I said, I'm a dad and I want to make sure that I give my child the best possible vitamins. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=534.04s)]
*  And that's why I'm so happy to have come across HIA Health. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=539.04s)]
*  The ingredients are amazing and I don't have to worry about sugar or gummy junk because HIA Health is made without that stuff and it's able to keep the great taste. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=541.68s)]
*  Now, we've worked out a special deal with HIA for their best selling children's vitamin. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=550.96s)]

*  Now, to claim this deal, you must go to HIAhealth.com. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=558.6s)]
*  Slash Midas. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=563.0s)]
*  Now, this deal is not available on their regular website. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=564.44s)]
*  Go to H I Y A H E A L T H dot com slash Midas and get your kids the full body nourishment they need to grow into healthy adults. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=567.96s)]
*  And by the way, shout out to California Governor Gavin Newsom, who's been standing up to Donald Trump. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=578.84s)]
*  Midas Touch Network had the exclusive on YouTube of Governor Newsom's incredible address to the state and the nation. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=584.36s)]
*  Looked incredibly presidential last night. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=592.6800000000001s)]
*  But hey, Donald, before you start all of your bloviating blabbering, I'm going to arrest you, I'm going to arrest you. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=595.28s)]
*  You may want to, I don't know, get the National Guard's pillow and a bed when you send them to basically be at war with Americans. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=601.44s)]
*  When you federalize the National Guard, in my view, very unlawfully, as the San Francisco Chronicle, page one reports, we talked about this yesterday as well when they broke the news. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=611.76s)]
*  Deployed troops unprepared soldiers sent to L.A. lack the basic necessities. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=623.16s)]
*  They were only able to operationalize also a few hundred of these National Guard troops. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=630.4399999999999s)]
*  And they basically put him to guard buildings and the LAPD basically had to guard them. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=635.68s)]
*  The whole thing was so bizarre. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=645.28s)]
*  Oh, have you have you heard this as well? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=647.2399999999999s)]
*  This is Trump's America. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=648.9599999999999s)]
*  So ICE and Customs and Border Protection, they're now hired as the security for the Club World Cup games. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=650.64s)]
*  The FIFA Club World Cup kicks off Saturday at the Hard Rock Stadium with Inter Miami playing a team from Egypt. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=662.4399999999999s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security announced that ICE and CBP personnel would be at the game providing security, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=670.0799999999999s)]
*  which raised questions among some who are wondering if the federal agents are just going to be part of the overall security team, which is normal for a big event. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=677.0s)]
*  I don't actually think that's normal at all. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=685.68s)]
*  Or will they be checking papers and detaining fans arriving for the game? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=687.64s)]
*  I just want to fact check this article by Six South Florida right there, because I think it's helpful that they're shining a light on this. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=691.76s)]
*  I've never gone to a sporting event and had the security be ICE agents and Customs and Border Protection. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=699.2s)]
*  OK, you know what the security is usually like at a sporting event? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=708.28s)]
*  Private security that works at the stadium. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=712.2s)]
*  And that's about it. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=714.4s)]
*  I understand in sometimes higher profile games you may have additional enhancements, but I've never seen ICE agents running security. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=715.16s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security, though, wants you to know that Kristi Noem, the dog killer cosplayer, she's very, very busy. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=725.1999999999999s)]
*  Here she is. This is a video they released today, and it's just like minutes of her signing papers. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=732.3199999999999s)]
*  Like that's that's what the video is. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=738.48s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=740.0799999999999s)]
*  And finally, we take you to State Regime Media Fox. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=746.16s)]
*  And this is what they're telling their viewers today. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=750.56s)]
*  They're promoting the Trump dictator parade. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=753.52s)]
*  It's going to be so patriotic. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=756.76s)]
*  Everybody come out and be there. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=758.56s)]
*  It's going to be the most patriotic event. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=760.12s)]
*  Donald Trump, the dictator, is going to look like Kim Jong-un or Vladimir Putin as tanks roll through Washington, D.C. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=762.12s)]
*  And we lie that it's only going to cost forty five million dollars. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=769.04s)]
*  It's going to be quite the spectacle here in the United States. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=772.4s)]
*  President Trump will host a parade this weekend to mark the 250th anniversary of the Army. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=775.12s)]
*  And those are your headlines, guys. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=781.12s)]
*  Back over to you. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  Also, it was not President Trump's idea with the parade for his birthday. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=783.32s)]
*  It was put up last time by General Joe Biden. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=787.32s)]
*  I'm so glad you brought it up to that. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=790.32s)]
*  And the Army was the one that suggested having this parade. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=791.76s)]
*  They're trying to say because his birthday is on Saturday and the parade is on Saturday. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=794.92s)]
*  He's doing this for his birthday. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=797.76s)]
*  It's going to be patriotic. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=799.0s)]
*  It's going to be patriotic and wonderful. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=800.1999999999999s)]
*  It's also like a military period. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=801.16s)]
*  It's also Flag Day. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HXLk3mTGg&t=802.16s)]
