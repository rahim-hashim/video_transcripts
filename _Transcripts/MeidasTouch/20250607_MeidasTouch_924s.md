*  international community friend and foe alike and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=7.58s)]
*  Donald Trump is just too dense to even know that he's being mocked or what's actually taking place [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=10.6s)]
*  So I want to share with you what went down this past week where you had [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=17.56s)]
*  Germany's new Chancellor Frederick Mares go to the Oval Office and Mares brought with him a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=22.52s)]
*  birth certificate of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=29.28s)]
*  Donald Trump's German grandfather [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=31.12s)]
*  Frederick Trump now the message here from Friedrich Mares is to tell Donald Trump dude [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=34.68s)]
*  you are an immigrant stop treating people like crap and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=42.08s)]
*  Letting him know also that you left Germany [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=47.2s)]
*  Essentially, so I want you to watch this moment where Friedrich Mares presents Donald Trump with the birth certificate [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=51.72s)]
*  This was this past week of Friedrich Trump here. Watch this [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=58.08s)]
*  I [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=88.08s)]
*  Was a good moment there, you know, and then I've previously showed you that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=96.08s)]
*  Vladimir Putin's been mocking Donald Trump by showing in lots of ways but particularly by showing [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=101.24s)]
*  Nudes of Melania all through Russian state regime TV [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=108.72s)]
*  They keep on playing Melania nude and then they mock her and they say what kind of low like low [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=113.02s)]
*  Clashy and Donald Trump are and the hosts just mock him relentlessly [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=119.5s)]
*  So when Putin spoke to Donald Trump two phone calls ago [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=123.74s)]
*  Putin's told Donald Trump how's how's your wife doing? Everybody here thinks she's so great every she's such a well [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=128.18s)]
*  You have such a well-respected wife. He's mocking her because they're showing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=134.22s)]
*  Melania nudes on Russian TV [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=138.78s)]
*  But then Donald Trump goes out and he's like Putin told me that they respect my wife Melania a lot [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=140.66s)]
*  They everybody loves Melania here play this clip compassionate first lady. I would tell she is very dedicated [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=146.9s)]
*  in fact [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=153.1s)]
*  If you look at just what I heard Putin just said they respect your wife a lot I said what about me [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=155.62s)]
*  You know, they will they like they like Melania better. That wasn't good. I don't know if that was good [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=161.22s)]
*  Okay, you know and then when Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada visited [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=167.9s)]
*  the Oval Office about a month ago or so I [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=174.78s)]
*  Think it's May 6th [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=178.78s)]
*  Prime Minister Carney [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=180.66s)]
*  Framed it this way to Donald Trump like I know you're a real estate guy [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=182.9s)]
*  So as a real estate guy, you know some things Donald are not for sale [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=186.9s)]
*  Canada's not for sale and then Carney in a very underhanded way that Donald Trump couldn't pick up said I [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=192.3s)]
*  Do want to give you credit though you forced Canada and a lot of people in Europe to to step up our [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=199.18s)]
*  security and to build up our defenses and Trump thinks that that's a compliment but what Carney's actually saying is to defend ourselves [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=206.26000000000002s)]
*  Against you being idiotic and destabilizing the world you moron [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  That's what Carney meant although he didn't say it here play this clip. It's two places they get along very well [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=219.34s)]
*  They like each other a lot [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=225.84s)]
*  Well, if I may [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  As you know from real estate there are some places that are never for sale. It's true. We're sitting in one right now [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=230.78s)]
*  You know Buckingham Palace you visited as well [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=236.7s)]
*  And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign last several months [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=239.94s)]
*  It's not for sale won't be for sale ever [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  But the opportunity is in the partnership and and what we can build together [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=249.7s)]
*  We have done that in the past and part of that as the president just said is with respect to our own security [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=254.82s)]
*  And my government is committed for a step change in our investment in Canadian security and our partnership [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=261.58s)]
*  And I'll say this as well that the president has [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=268.94s)]
*  revitalized [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=273.26s)]
*  Revitalized and us playing our full weight in NATO and that will be part. Okay. So now going back to the Friedrich Mars [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=275.5s)]
*  appearance so Friedrich Mars [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=283.7s)]
*  After being in the Oval Office then goes on Fox [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=286.58s)]
*  why because he knows that Donald Trump's going to be watching it on Fox and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=289.74s)]
*  here [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=295.06s)]
*  Friedrich Mars basically says [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=296.3s)]
*  You know what? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=298.74s)]
*  I don't like to think about whether if Donald Trump was in office whether or not Putin would have or would have done anything [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=299.62s)]
*  He goes that that's an irrelevant discussion [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=306.38s)]
*  He knows what we have to focus on is what's happening right now and we need to help Ukraine [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=308.5s)]
*  Watch how Friedrich Mars goes on Fox to basically not just troll Donald Trump [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=314.74s)]
*  But you know also deliver a powerful message play this clip [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=320.66s)]
*  President often likes to say that this war would have never happened had he been in the White House [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=324.26s)]
*  Do you agree with that? Well, this is this is [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=329.09999999999997s)]
*  Theory or speculation which could be right or wrong? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=333.38s)]
*  But this war is now happening and we have to tackle that and we have to resolve it now [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=336.65999999999997s)]
*  it makes no sense to to to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=342.62s)]
*  Discuss the past this has happened if we had [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=345.82s)]
*  Ukraine as member in NATO which was applied in 2008 and the Americans gave [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  Support to that the French and the German government were against it [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=356.26000000000005s)]
*  You can again speculate what this war had happened Ukraine was then a big nuclear power [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=359.70000000000005s)]
*  They were the third biggest nuclear power in the world and they agreed to get rid of all the nickel nuclear weapons and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=367.62s)]
*  There after Russia attacked [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=375.18s)]
*  Ukraine would this have happened had happened with nuclear weapons on the ground you can [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=377.90000000000003s)]
*  Ask the same question again. No this war is now happening and we have to stop it now [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=383.86s)]
*  This is our task, okay, because then you compare what you know [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=389.46s)]
*  Friedrich Mars is saying to what Trump was saying this is how Donald Trump greeted Friedrich Mars in the Oval Office [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEnu_j6558&t=392.76s)]
