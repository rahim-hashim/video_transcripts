# PISSED OFF University Prez PUTS THE DAGGER into Trump
**MeidasTouch:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA)
*  We shouldn't be asking when full-fledged authoritarianism is going to be coming to the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, it is here right now. Just look at what the Trump regime has done over the past few weeks. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=4.8s)]
*  The DOJ is investigating ActBlue. The FTC is investigating Media Matters. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=9.3s)]
*  The DHS is targeting Harvard. The executive office is going after Democratic allied law firms. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=13.9s)]
*  The U.S. attorney charging a Democratic lawmaker with the crime. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=20.2s)]
*  FBI is arresting a liberal judge and threatening to arrest others. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=24.0s)]
*  The real question is, who's fighting back in this moment? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=28.3s)]
*  And I do give a hat tip to Harvard, where other universities have capitulated. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  And we could criticize Harvard and other areas, but they are certainly fighting back when it comes to the Trump regime [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=36.2s)]
*  trying to shut them down and trying to gain access to student records and student files. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=41.8s)]
*  And I think one of the Trump regime's requests was basically to have a full audit of all of the political views [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=46.5s)]
*  and the faculty, among other things, and to prevent Harvard from implementing anything having to do with diversity. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=53.6s)]
*  So by now you may know the headline that the Trump regime is stopping or is preventing Harvard from having international students. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=59.7s)]
*  27% of the Harvard student body is international students. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=67.7s)]
*  The Trump regime says that all of them will now basically be deemed to be here unlawfully and they will be deported immediately. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=71.9s)]
*  And then the question then becomes, is, you know, deported where? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=78.5s)]
*  We see the Trump regime's tactics, both in terms of sending people to El Salvador, South Sudan. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=82.5s)]
*  They've been having talks with Libya, back to their home countries, wherever. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=88.2s)]
*  It's not a pleasant process to say the least. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=92.6s)]
*  And in some cases, it's outright torturous. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=96.3s)]
*  Harvard has responded with a powerful letter to its international students, as well as immediately filed the lawsuit, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=99.2s)]
*  the letter to the Harvard community is as follows. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  Yesterday, the federal government announced that it has revoked Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=109.7s)]
*  and stripped the University of its authority to sponsor F&J visas for international students and scholars for the 2025-2026 academic year. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=116.5s)]
*  The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=125.5s)]
*  and submit to the federal government's illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty and our student body. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=132.5s)]
*  We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=139.8s)]
*  It imperils the future of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=142.8s)]
*  throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=151.1s)]
*  We have just filed a complaint and a motion for a temporary restraining order. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=157.6s)]
*  And then it says the Harvard International Office will continue to provide updates for those international students and scholars affected by yesterday's actions. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=162.4s)]
*  You need to know you are a vital members of our community. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=170.9s)]
*  You are classmates and friends, our colleagues and mentors, our partners in the work of this great institution. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  Thanks to you, we know more and understand more in our country and our world are more enlightened. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=180.0s)]
*  ...most to ensure that Harvard remains open to the world. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=188.0s)]
*  And then in their lawsuit that was filed, Harvard has sued the Trump regime, saying it has made 7,000 foreign students pawns in an unconstitutional bid to bludgeon the university over its first amendment protected viewpoints. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=191.6s)]
*  Kyle Cheney was one of the first to post that lawsuit. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=206.0s)]
*  The thing to note also is that the Trump regime is not alleging that Harvard actually violated any specific law. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=209.4s)]
*  There's no like you violated this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=216.4s)]
*  You engaged in this conduct. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=218.4s)]
*  Also, we should note that I think there was a stat that it was like 40 percent of a lot of the startups that have gotten over a billion dollars in the United States have CEOs who came from foreign countries and who studied at places like Harvard. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=219.8s)]
*  Let's bring in David Weigel, reporter at Semaphore. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=235.3s)]
*  You've been covering a lot of the creep to authoritarianism and in my view, the authoritarianism that's here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=238.2s)]
*  I mean, you can speak to the scapegoating of immigrants. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=248.0s)]
*  Your newsletter has been focused on that a lot recently, how the Trump regime is going to be trying to sell the fact that it's taking so many Americans off of Medicaid by targeting immigrants. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=250.5s)]
*  And we see this angle here with Harvard as well. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=262.2s)]
*  It's attacking the international students to then kind of implement the overall authoritarian agenda. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=265.1s)]
*  The immigrants, the migrants are the pawns in this broader authoritarian scheme. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=271.8s)]
*  Dave, you've been covering this for a long time. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  Alumnum of Washington Post before coming to Semaphore, where you're leading their political coverage. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=278.5s)]
*  Talk to us about this. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=283.6s)]
*  Certainly, I read the complaint from Harvard's attorneys, which include Robert Herr, who you might remember from last season. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=285.90000000000003s)]
*  And it's pretty convincing. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=293.3s)]
*  I don't think your listeners need to be convinced by this, but they point out the administration has been spamming them basically with requests, demanding information, has made asks that it can't answer. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=296.0s)]
*  For example, any protest activity on campus in the last five years. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=308.5s)]
*  And not just protest activity includes lots of things with video, not just something that went out out of hand or somebody was scuffling, etc. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=313.1s)]
*  Any protest. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=320.7s)]
*  So they point out this violates the First Amendment, this violates, or they argue, I should say, but it's convincing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  First Amendment due process clause, administrative procedure act. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=328.5s)]
*  And if you're again, probably not one of your listeners, if you're out there saying, haha, I love seeing the government stick it to these guys, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=331.3s)]
*  they ask for all their legal fees to be paid as part of the settlement. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=338.09999999999997s)]
*  So taxpayers may end up paying Harvard's legal team. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=341.4s)]
*  I'm not sure if it's a great blow against the elites. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=345.0s)]
*  But backing up, what is the political strategy here? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=347.2s)]
*  It is it everything does run through America First nationalism and portraying their opponents from the Democratic Party to elite institutions as tools of the global elite who want who care about immigrants, not about you. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=350.4s)]
*  It's it's Stephen Miller mindset. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=363.9s)]
*  It permeates everything that they do in this case. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=366.0s)]
*  I would have a critical is the wrong word. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=370.7s)]
*  In this case, it does go back on something Trump hinted during the campaign because he likes to say he keeps his promises. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=372.4s)]
*  He delivers on his campaign promises. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=378.4s)]
*  You might remember when he went on the All In podcast and hosts in Silicon Valley who wanted him to win and wanted to agree with them. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=381.2s)]
*  He said, well, any talented foreign student, we should staple a diploma to start a green card to their diploma when they get out. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=388.79999999999995s)]
*  And the host said, that's great. And the campaign quickly said, actually, he didn't mean that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=396.29999999999995s)]
*  And this is this is obviously the opposite of that. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=401.3s)]
*  The implications are thousands of people who let's say the definition of elite we can all agree on the elite of the world who come to this who come to this campus are now in flux. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  They're being told go apply for something else which they can't do. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=417.9s)]
*  Change your travel arrangements. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=420.9s)]
*  They weren't budgeted for the. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=422.5s)]
*  This is the opposite of attracting talent because again, privilege the conservative argument here. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=425.3s)]
*  You don't like the Ivy League. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=431.0s)]
*  You think that they're cruel to that Israel. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=432.3s)]
*  You don't like that. They're woke. You don't like DEI, whatever. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=436.1s)]
*  The kind of students that are being attracted by this are the ones doing high level research. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=440.6s)]
*  There are some students who are undergrads and maybe they're coming from around the world. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=445.5s)]
*  Their parents are rich. Whatever. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=451.2s)]
*  There are also people coming to do high level research. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=452.6s)]
*  Exactly the people who whose grants are being canceled right now. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=455.1s)]
*  There's this this impact that's going to happen on the research capacity that we just take it for granted for 70 years, 70 years. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=458.6s)]
*  How long this foreign student program has been going on and it's being blown up because politically it's very safe. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=467.1s)]
*  The Republicans think to say the other side cares about immigrants. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=473.8s)]
*  We care about you. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=477.1s)]
*  Vance isn't even I want to go. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=478.5s)]
*  I want to put words his mouth. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=481.0s)]
*  But but but the Vance side of the party that Miller side of the party and very comfortable saying let's take these spaces away and give them to Americans without any concern for are they going to have the same skills, the same talents? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=482.3s)]
*  Are we going to benefit because they they stay in the country because it's part of the year is let's pull let's pull talented immigrants into the country and keep them here and make sure if they found a company they do it in America. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=495.2s)]
*  This is what some Republicans, including Trump, said they wanted last year. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=508.2s)]
*  They contrasted let's say asylum seekers who don't have super marketable skills or research abilities crossing the border getting asylum. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=512.1s)]
*  They said, well, we don't want those people. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=521.1s)]
*  Maybe we want the talented people coming to elite universities. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=522.9s)]
*  And now they're saying, no, we don't any anyone in these schools care more about immigrants. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=525.7s)]
*  They care about you. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=529.0s)]
*  So it's politically consistent, but it's all it is. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=530.5s)]
*  It is use the word authoritarian. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=533.1s)]
*  That's a fine word to use. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=534.5s)]
*  If we were watching Canada do this or watching France do this right now and say we're not letting any Americans into the school for political reasons, we probably would use that word. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=535.7s)]
*  So I don't know why the word would be anathema to something happening here. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=545.5s)]
*  You know, sometimes saying it in ways like that, I've never said it the way you just said it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=550.0s)]
*  But you're right. If we were to see Canada, France, the United Kingdom, you name the country doing the things and say, you know, French President Emmanuel Macron. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=554.2s)]
*  Did X, Y, Z. I could guarantee you that we would be saying France is an authoritarian state. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=565.5s)]
*  And yet the language here, you know, is still outside of, you know, you know, a few others not really capturing. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=572.3s)]
*  I think, you know what you just said very directly. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=582.9s)]
*  But, you know, it doesn't seem to follow a pattern right here, which is I think this is inextricably intertwined with what happened with this budget. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=585.7s)]
*  Budget bill, which is going to be very harmful for Trump's base. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=595.0s)]
*  I mean, it's literally the large redistribution of wealth and it's going to impact red states and particularly Trump voters who are have higher amounts of percentage wise of people on Medicaid states that are taker states versus donor states that rely on the federal government. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=599.6999999999999s)]
*  More more people on snap and more people that rely on the Department of Education. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=617.6s)]
*  So the pattern is you do a move like this. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=622.3s)]
*  You kind of screw over your base. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=625.1999999999999s)]
*  You pickpocket them. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=627.4s)]
*  You then you then do the smoke screen. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=628.9s)]
*  You know, you do something that's unconstitutional, but you attack foreigners and you just you just shove it, you know, in the American people's face. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=632.1999999999999s)]
*  Ha ha. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=641.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, I think literally the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, you know, did a post yesterday. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=641.9s)]
*  Suck it like she literally wrote. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=646.9s)]
*  Right. Suck it like suck it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=648.5999999999999s)]
*  And then and then Donald Trump goes and golfs and then he goes and golfs for the weekend does a mean coin thing. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=650.3s)]
*  See you later. So to me and as you as a as a writer who covers this like does it now kind of follow, you know, the pattern, you know, is this going to be the week where he does more tariff threats and then he's going to the markets going to go down and then he's going to have to be like, okay, you know, I'm going to have to make a deal now, which isn't really a deal. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=656.0999999999999s)]
*  It just fixing the mess. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=676.4s)]
*  It just feels okay. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=677.5999999999999s)]
*  Here we go again. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=679.1s)]
*  It's this storyline. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=680.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=683.2s)]
*  And I'd say my first principle covering this administration is never be surprised or never say this is unprecedented, even if it's unprecedented, because what's the point? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=684.0s)]
*  This administration was very clear. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=694.7s)]
*  I should say the Trump campaign is very clear about what it would do if it became another administration. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=696.8s)]
*  Claremont Institute. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=702.5s)]
*  There was a lot of good reporting on what conservatives wanted from a future Republic administration and how it would use the levers of power. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=703.9s)]
*  So I start by not being surprised by things and say, okay, how would this work? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=713.3s)]
*  And the only downside there is sometimes a reader thinks that you're being a little too glib about it, which which guilty you should be clear about the implications of this. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=718.0s)]
*  But they've been throughout these hundred and forty days or so ready to use executive power that they will probably get reversed. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=727.7s)]
*  The best case scenario for them is they get a good judgment at the Supreme Court or at least the Supreme Court upholding a Fifth Circuit ruling, which happened this week with with the ability to suspend independent agency heads. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=737.4000000000001s)]
*  We're going to pay everybody. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=752.8s)]
*  We're throwing out a 90 year old precedent in a memo because we think we can. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=754.4s)]
*  They win some of these, but generally they have the DOJ. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=759.0999999999999s)]
*  They have our you and me and everyone paying taxes. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=763.3s)]
*  They have the power of the federal government with all of the guns of the security state behind it, endless resources. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=766.1999999999999s)]
*  And the self justification for this for a lot of conservatives is well, when Democrats had this, they did this to us. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=775.0s)]
*  They'll say this is vengeance. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=780.3s)]
*  Now, if they say this out loud, it shows up in a in a legal brief and it hurts them. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=783.3s)]
*  This is vengeance for what Letitia James did to Donald Trump. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=788.8s)]
*  This is vengeance for what House Democrats did to Donald Trump. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=791.9s)]
*  They they this is vengeance for the DOJ investigating pro-life groups. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=796.1999999999999s)]
*  They did that to us and we're going to do it to them. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=800.5999999999999s)]
*  It's tit for tat. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=802.4s)]
*  But and they're very they're very blatant about that. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=803.4s)]
*  I want to repeat myself too much, but when there were investigations led by the DOJ, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=806.2s)]
*  they made justice or US attorneys that Republicans didn't like the immigrants and an attorney did not say we're doing this to screw you over. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=812.4s)]
*  You don't say it out loud. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=820.7s)]
*  They're very blatant about this. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=821.9s)]
*  Ed Martin, who was moved from DC US attorney to justice, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=823.3000000000001s)]
*  to the pardon attorney with a couple other titles, had this press conference when he was being pulled out of the US attorney's office [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=828.6s)]
*  because he couldn't be confirmed and said, well, I'm not going and I'm paraphrasing a little bit and pull the video up that we're going to try to make cases, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=835.7s)]
*  but we can at least draw attention to cases that maybe we can't bring, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=845.5s)]
*  but we think but we think there's been wrongdoing. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=849.5s)]
*  You're not supposed to do that because the that is basically the basis of law of law in England, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=852.1s)]
*  America, our legal tradition. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=862.9000000000001s)]
*  You can't just have the government out there saying, hey, we're going to damage your reputation. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=865.1s)]
*  You end up having to pay a settlement for that at least if you're using the tools of the state to just damage somebody's reputation when you can't bring a case. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=868.9s)]
*  But this administration you mentioned, Christine Noem, I'm not saying every administration doesn't know what hobbyist Corpus is. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=877.2s)]
*  I know that she doesn't because she got asked about it and couldn't and couldn't define it. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=883.3000000000001s)]
*  And they're being very blase with these powers in a way that's pretty risky. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=887.0s)]
*  They might get reversed. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=891.5s)]
*  Is there going to be a political backlash? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=893.1s)]
*  That's actually the least certain part of this. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=895.1s)]
*  Is there a legal backlash? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=897.0s)]
*  Yes, because the judges read the transcript to show up one of these hearings. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=897.9s)]
*  Judges are furious at how slapdash and stuff is. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=902.0s)]
*  Is it popular? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=905.4s)]
*  Well, that gets you to where their political thinking is. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=906.3000000000001s)]
*  Yes, there are things you can do that are legally Ed Martins kind of crusade against Schumer that went nowhere. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=908.9s)]
*  Republicans loved it. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=915.5s)]
*  The base loved it. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=916.8000000000001s)]
*  You can go on Newsmax and defend it. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=917.8000000000001s)]
*  They think it's amazing. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=919.3000000000001s)]
*  And if they're maintaining their base and trying to demolish the left, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=921.2s)]
*  yes, they can get very far with that because the other part of this, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=925.3000000000001s)]
*  and I don't want to talk too much about it, is you can win. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=927.9000000000001s)]
*  If the DOJ brings a terrible case against you, you can get it dismissed. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=931.1s)]
*  You in the meantime, maybe have to spend money on attorneys. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=935.0s)]
*  Maybe you're lucky and you're pro bono or you're an attorney and defend yourself. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=938.3000000000001s)]
*  But that's hours, months, years of your life defending this. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=941.4000000000001s)]
*  And even if you get restitution, your life can be badly affected by the federal government's power to prosecute you. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=947.4s)]
*  Republicans say we're doing this because, and I'm speaking universally about Republicans, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=956.1999999999999s)]
*  but it's not hard to find a Trump person or House of Republicans saying this. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=960.5s)]
*  Well, they did this to the J-6ers. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=965.4s)]
*  And it's a very tit for tat style of politics that they are pursuing. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=967.0s)]
*  Again, if we saw it elsewhere, I think we'd be able to identify what it is. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=972.4s)]
*  Separate this from the policy that they're trying to implement. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=976.3000000000001s)]
*  Just the legal strategy here on things that probably will be reversed is really radical. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=979.4000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's getting all the attention deserves. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=986.5s)]
*  You know, look, it sounds very Trumpy, right? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=989.2s)]
*  When he would not be in office, what would he do? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=992.0s)]
*  File the lawsuit, get the headline, pump the headline, either quietly resolve the case or dismiss it [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=995.3000000000001s)]
*  and hope that nobody actually talks about that. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=1003.4s)]
*  And you get the headline, you push it. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=1006.4s)]
*  But I think it's important that we continue to cover these things. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=1008.9s)]
*  And as you said, read the dang newsletter. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=1013.8s)]
*  And you've got the newsletter on Semaphore. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=1016.5999999999999s)]

*  Republicans Preparing to Cut Medicaid for U.S. Citizens, Would Prefer to Talk About Immigrants. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=1024.1s)]
*  Tell everybody to check out your writing on Semaphore, Dave, and come back and join us again. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMGhXbqzvFA&t=1029.3s)]
