# Trump’s AWFUL Past SECRETS Resurface FINALLY!!!
**MeidasTouch:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI)
*  Donald Trump can't hide his dark past from coming to light yet again, but he [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=0.0s)]
*  sure is trying right after Elon Musk was making post after post about Trump, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=5.24s)]
*  including saying time to drop the really big bomb at real Donald Trump is in the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=11.72s)]
*  Epstein files. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=17.36s)]
*  That is the real reason why they have not been made public. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=18.2s)]
*  Have a nice day, DJT. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=21.8s)]
*  Mark this post for the future. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=24.96s)]
*  The truth will come out. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  It was just notable that Trump was pretty silent. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=28.56s)]
*  I mean, Elon Musk accusing Donald Trump of covering up sex trafficking by using [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=31.2s)]
*  the Department of Justice to deep six the files. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=38.0s)]
*  Y'all recall that Democratic Congress member Dan Goldman had been calling out [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=44.04s)]
*  the Department of Justice in a scathing letter about a month back saying, we [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  have deep concerns that you're covering this up. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  And Elon Musk, who was right there with Donald Trump every step of the way, was [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=55.64s)]
*  like, yeah, he's covering this up. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  That's what he's doing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=61.84s)]
*  And, and all Donald Trump has offered. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  I mean, isn't this telling all Donald Trump has said is, you know, I'm not [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=65.48s)]
*  even thinking about it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=68.84s)]
*  Elon's got a problem. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=70.28s)]
*  The poor guy's got a problem. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=72.0s)]
*  And that says Elon Musk is posting this video. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=74.56s)]
*  This is a video that Elon Musk posted here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=77.08s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=79.16s)]
*  I'm going to get great ratings on your show. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=80.32s)]
*  Trump is surrounded by women as music flares in the background. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=82.2s)]
*  After a while, Trump goes to greet three new guests, among them, the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=86.48s)]
*  financier, Jeffrey Epstein, more than a decade before his guilty plea on state [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  prostitution charges. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  Later in the footage, Trump is seen talking to Epstein and another man as [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=99.56s)]
*  women are dancing in front of them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=103.88s)]
*  Trump alternates between dancing and pointing out women to Epstein and the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=105.92s)]
*  other man and telling Epstein about the cameras. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=110.0s)]
*  Though exactly what they say is difficult to understand as they discuss the women [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=114.92s)]
*  and their appearances. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=119.6s)]
*  Trump gestures to one and appears to say to Epstein, look at her back there. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=121.36s)]
*  She's hot. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  And then Trump says something else into Epstein's ear that makes him double [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=130.36s)]
*  over with laughter. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=135.64s)]
*  But as the president says now, he never liked Epstein. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=137.6s)]
*  So Elon Musk posted that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=143.56s)]
*  Let me just give you all some facts as well. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=145.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is in Jeffrey Epstein's flight log at least seven times from the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=147.44s)]
*  flight log portions that had been released in prior court proceedings. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=154.12s)]
*  Trump's name all over the deposition transcripts in court cases that had been [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=157.44s)]
*  relieved victims of Epstein saying things like Jeffrey said, great, let's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=163.16s)]
*  call up Trump. We'll go to Trump's casino. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=167.52s)]
*  And the Ghislaine Maxwell case, a woman who was 14 years old at the time said [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=169.96s)]
*  that Epstein and Ghislaine introduced her to Donald Trump. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=174.92s)]
*  Donald Trump's been spotted in Epstein's personal address book that's been [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=180.04s)]
*  released in another court case. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=184.16s)]
*  Trump was identified as Doe 174. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=185.88s)]
*  And, you know, wasn't it what three months ago when Pam Bondi said she had the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=189.84s)]
*  files on her desk and that she was going to release them? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=194.88s)]
*  Here's what she said three months ago. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=198.64s)]
*  The DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=199.64s)]
*  Will that really happen? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  It's sitting on my desk right now to review. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=205.56s)]
*  That's been a directive by President Trump. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=208.64s)]
*  I'm reviewing that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=211.12s)]
*  I'm reviewing JFK files, MLK files. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=211.92s)]
*  That's all in the process of being reviewed because that was done at the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=215.12s)]
*  directive of the president. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=218.08s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  I was briefed on that yesterday. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  I can't talk about that publicly, but, you know, President Trump has given a [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=223.08s)]
*  very strong directive and that's going to be followed. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=227.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=229.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=230.08s)]
*  So a lot of documents. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=230.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=232.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=232.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  So people can expect actual movement on this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=233.28s)]
*  It's not just empty promises. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=235.12s)]
*  Oh, Donald Trump doesn't make empty promises. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=236.4s)]
*  I think promises made, promises kept. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=238.96s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't make empty promises. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=243.12s)]
*  The guy's the biggest liar about everything. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=244.72000000000003s)]
*  And then finally, I'll show you this one, May 28th, 2025. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=246.08s)]
*  This is what Cash Patel said on Fox when he was asked, where are the files? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=249.28s)]
*  It's three months have passed here. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=253.08s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  The other thing on the internet is the Epstein files. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=255.44s)]
*  What's the answer to that? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=258.52000000000004s)]
*  The answer to that is the same as everything else. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=260.72s)]
*  I'm not going to withhold information from the American public ever, but I'm [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  also not going to rush to get it out there in a format in which they can't rely on it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=269.16s)]
*  So on the Epstein matter, any other matters, we are diligently working on that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=274.24s)]
*  And it takes time to go through years of investigations, years of political [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=278.2s)]
*  maneuvering and years of cover-up to get the American people what they deserve. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=284.64s)]
*  And that's what I'm going to give them on everything. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=288.28s)]
*  You know, when Cash Patel was in his prior job as a right wing, uh, podcaster, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=291.4s)]
*  he said that it could be released within a day. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=296.52s)]
*  And he was also one of the individuals who constantly talked about Epstein, Epstein, Epstein. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  The FBI is covering up. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  We'll release it in a day. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=304.52s)]
*  Let's bring in democratic Congress member, Dan Goldman, who about a month ago we had [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  John, you sent that letter calling out Pam Bondi. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=309.44s)]
*  What are you seeing? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=312.0s)]
*  What's your response to all of this? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=312.88s)]
*  Well, the suspicions seem to be confirmed by someone who should know. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=315.0s)]
*  Elon Musk has been right by Donald Trump's side for the last almost year now, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=320.52s)]
*  including on the campaign. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=326.79999999999995s)]
*  And, uh, like, you know, a bad breakup or from my former life as a prosecutor, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=328.72s)]
*  uh, when close associates cooperate against each other, it gets really nasty and they [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=336.32s)]
*  have deep dark secrets. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=342.12s)]
*  And that's clearly, uh, what Elon Musk was doing as he was, uh, blowing up yesterday. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=344.64s)]
*  Um, and it can, he confirmed exactly what my letter, uh, suspected, which is that there [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=351.84s)]
*  was this mad rush. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=358.56s)]
*  You played some great clips of, uh, Pam Bondi and Cash Patel and everyone, you know, on [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=359.64s)]
*  the Mago, right desperate to have those files released. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=365.88s)]
*  They were on track to be released. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=369.47999999999996s)]
*  And then there was radio silence. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=371.0s)]
*  Uh, and the question was always, well, what happened? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=373.08s)]
*  You were so gung ho about releasing them. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  You said you were going to do it, uh, within a matter of days back in February. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=377.64000000000004s)]
*  I, we had, we knew that, uh, FBI agents had been tasked to review, uh, the, all of the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=382.72s)]
*  files to make sure no victims are identities or names are revealed. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=389.6s)]
*  And then now we get confirmation from Elon Musk, uh, that yes, the suspicion was [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=394.88s)]
*  accurate. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=401.36s)]
*  Uh, the suspicion is confirmed that the reason why Pam Bondi is not releasing the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=401.96000000000004s)]
*  Epstein files is because Donald Trump is in them and forget about what Donald Trump [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=407.56s)]
*  says. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=413.16s)]
*  We can follow up on what his actions are. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=413.96s)]
*  That's where we have to pay attention. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=416.6s)]
*  And the fact that these have been concealed for so long, um, it gave a rise to the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=418.4s)]
*  suspicion that has now been confirmed. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=424.56s)]
*  No, now that Elon is no longer a special advisor to Donald Trump, um, you know, the, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=427.24s)]
*  the same types of arguments they were trying to make, I think, to shield him from [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=433.8s)]
*  subpoenas and things like that, executive privileges and things like that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=437.92s)]
*  Does that go away? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=441.64s)]
*  So ostensibly, if the, the Republicans, unfortunately are still in control of the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=442.88s)]
*  house and they hold subpoena power, but they can't hide behind the executive [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  privilege anymore. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=452.2s)]
*  I don't think, I mean, that Elon's now a private citizen and Elon's posting these [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=453.03999999999996s)]
*  things, which if anything to me would be some sort of waiver. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  If the Republicans wanted to get to the bottom of this, I know you want to get to [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=461.52s)]
*  the bottom of it, but they, they control the subpoena power. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=465.35999999999996s)]
*  Could they right now? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=468.4s)]
*  Oh, they absolutely could. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=470.28s)]
*  Of course they could get to the bottom of everything and they have very [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=471.44s)]
*  intentionally and willfully avoided any kind of oversight over the incredible [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=475.08s)]
*  lawlessness in this administration. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=480.67999999999995s)]
*  But what is interesting is that there are a number of congressional Republicans who [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=482.91999999999996s)]
*  have been very aggressively pushing for the Epstein files to be released. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=487.04s)]
*  And think about this just for a second, Ben, you, you outlined a lot of public [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=491.84s)]
*  information that is out there already about Donald Trump's interactions, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=497.16s)]
*  associations with Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=502.64s)]
*  So it's not as if this, it would be a surprise that Donald Trump had some [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=505.96s)]
*  relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=511.84s)]
*  And it probably wouldn't be worth concealing that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=514.12s)]
*  So to me, you know, my Spidey ears go up a little bit because it's, I wonder [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=518.32s)]
*  what is in there that would make Donald Trump so intent on keeping it covered up [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=523.44s)]
*  that is different from everything that's already out there. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=531.84s)]
*  And so it really raises the question as to whether Donald Trump had some [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=536.0400000000001s)]
*  involvement in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking conspiracy, whether it be [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=541.36s)]
*  either some sort of criminal involvement or some involvement with the underage [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=546.96s)]
*  women. And those are questions that I think the American people really should [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=551.68s)]
*  know about the president of the United States. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=556.32s)]
*  And if he is directing his attorney general to conceal information from the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=558.96s)]
*  American people because it's politically harmful to him, that is an abuse of [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=564.52s)]
*  power and it is completely improper. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=569.92s)]
*  And so I expect that those Republicans who've been so gung-ho about getting the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=572.4s)]
*  Epstein files should still want them. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=576.92s)]
*  I just want to pivot for a moment and just talk about, I saw this video that you [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=580.12s)]
*  and Congressmember Swalwell did together where Congressmember Swalwell asked you, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=583.56s)]
*  you know, what's your take on reading the bills? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=588.5999999999999s)]
*  It was funny, but it's a serious issue because these MAGA Republicans, whether [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=591.4799999999999s)]
*  it's Marjorie Taylor Greene or who else did I see? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=595.92s)]
*  I saw that Republican Congressmember from Nebraska, like whether they're holding [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=599.16s)]
*  town halls or they're going in front of their speaking on the House floor, you [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=604.28s)]
*  know, they're saying, here's a lesson. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=609.64s)]
*  We should have read the bill because I didn't realize there's a provision that [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=611.36s)]
*  says that states can control their A.I. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=614.68s)]
*  rights for 10 years. Or the guy in Nebraska I'm thinking about was like, and now [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=617.56s)]
*  I found out that there was a provision in here that divests federal courts of being [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=621.56s)]
*  able to hold people in contempt if you don't post a security. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=626.4s)]
*  I don't support that provision. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=629.52s)]
*  And it's like, well, dude, you voted. What are you doing? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=631.12s)]
*  You voted for these things. What are you talking about? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=633.16s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=637.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, look, there are a number of problems with it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=639.4s)]
*  The first is obviously you need to know what you're voting on. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=644.0s)]
*  And there are many ways, you know, that this bill was dropped at the very last [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=648.52s)]
*  minute was eleven hundred pages. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=652.52s)]
*  But there were so many ways of getting information about it that there are staff [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=654.6800000000001s)]
*  members who have summaries, the committees have summaries. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=660.6s)]
*  Certainly those of us on the other side who knew we didn't like it were still going [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=663.76s)]
*  through all of the details to make sure that we understood it. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=668.0400000000001s)]
*  The second thing is that both of those issues that Marjorie Taylor Green mentioned [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=671.6s)]
*  and the other one related to contempt proceedings were widely publicized, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=675.48s)]
*  widely debated in committee and on the House floor. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=681.0s)]
*  These were not secrets that no one was talking about. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=685.4s)]
*  These were very well known things. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=689.12s)]
*  And so this is just simply a case of buyer's remorse and trying to come up with [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=691.44s)]
*  some excuse that basically makes them look as incompetent and unqualified as they [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=698.08s)]
*  are to do the job. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=705.4s)]
*  Our basic and most fundamental obligation is to vote. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=707.04s)]
*  And our second most fundamental obligation is to know what we're voting on. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=711.3199999999999s)]
*  And if you're out there admitting that you don't know what you're voting on and you [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=716.52s)]
*  regret your vote, then you're not qualified or competent to be in Congress. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=720.64s)]
*  And then finally, there are other excuse. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=727.56s)]
*  And this is what I'm hearing a ton of these Republicans saying in the House. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=729.56s)]
*  We knew it was a bad bill. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=733.88s)]
*  This is what they're saying to that. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=735.36s)]
*  We knew it was bad, but what our plan was, we give it to the Senate. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=736.32s)]
*  So they fix our bad bill and then they hand it back to us and then we get a better one. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=741.48s)]
*  What do you say to what do you say to that excuse? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=748.32s)]
*  It's it's total BS. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=753.4s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's ridiculous. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=756.44s)]
*  You're voting on what you're voting on. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=758.16s)]
*  And the idea of playing games and by the way, Republicans are not shy about holding [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=760.2s)]
*  Democrats to things that we vote on if and regardless of whether it's binding or non [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=768.88s)]
*  binding or has any any influence on anything. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=776.12s)]
*  This is the most significant bill of this term thus far by far and away. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=780.36s)]
*  And if they don't know what they're doing and they just say, oh, we'll throw it to the [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=786.36s)]
*  Senate and we'll have them, it'll come back from them is an abdication of their own [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=790.4399999999999s)]
*  responsibility. It's passing the buck. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=795.56s)]
*  And it's shameful, but it just goes to show where this Republican Party is today. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=798.04s)]
*  And they should be embarrassed. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=804.2s)]
*  They, of course, aren't. They should be ashamed. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=806.6s)]
*  They have no shame. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=808.4399999999999s)]
*  And they'll just keep pushing forward to try to hurt the American people as much as they [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=810.2s)]
*  can to benefit themselves and their billionaire donors. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVm3QtDoxI&t=814.28s)]
