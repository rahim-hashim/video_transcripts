# Trump LOSES IT after Disaster HE CAUSED
**MeidasTouch:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4)
*  I know we have bigger problems than this to discuss, and we will, but this makeup that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is wearing right now as he walks around the White House with globs of this [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=5.2s)]
*  stuff on his face, it's just so utterly bizarre, and it almost, to me, accentuates the madness [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=10.44s)]
*  of this entire regime. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=18.14s)]
*  The cacostocracy meets fascism all wrapped up into one disgusting and despicable bow. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=20.32s)]
*  I mean, as Donald Trump is crashing our economy, as our GDP shrunk negative 0.3% for the first [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=28.0s)]
*  quarter, as freight and trucking volumes are precipitously declining, Donald Trump is creating [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  fake websites that look like it's the Drudge Report, but it's on WhiteHouse.gov where [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  Donald Trump writes headlines about himself. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=51.64s)]
*  So when it's clear our economy is heading in a disastrous direction because of Trump's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=55.76s)]
*  reckless trade wars against the world, Donald Trump made this website. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=61.36s)]
*  It looks like Drudge and it says, the most successful first 100 days in presidential [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=65.44s)]
*  history. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=71.52s)]
*  I mean, this stuff is really, really pathetic. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=72.52s)]
*  Donald Trump began yesterday by making post after post on social media like this one right [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  here saying that this is Biden's stock market, not Trump's. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=83.28s)]
*  You're in office. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=88.72s)]
*  You're literally the president. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=90.12s)]
*  You've been the president now for not like even one day or two days, 100 days. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=92.12s)]
*  The election was in November. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=97.44s)]
*  And by the way, in 2024, when the stock market was setting record highs, when our economy [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=100.0s)]
*  was booming, when Wall Street Journal and others said that our economy was the envy [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=107.48s)]
*  of the world. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=113.04s)]
*  We were leading the world in GDP and energy production. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=114.04s)]
*  We had record low unemployment, record high job growth, 16.2 million jobs created. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=117.64s)]
*  Your posts back in 2024 when you were not in office said this is Trump's stock market [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=124.2s)]
*  and the economy's doing great because people want Trump back in. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=131.16s)]
*  So now that you're in and things are crashing, you blame it on Biden. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=135.92s)]
*  It is the most pathetic lack of leadership that exists. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  But Donald Trump doesn't give a crap about you or me. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't care about the American people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=149.2s)]
*  He's a fraud. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=151.64s)]
*  He's a felon. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  He's a criminal. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=154.64s)]
*  He's a sexual abuser. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=156.12s)]
*  With all of this chaos that he's creating, what's he doing behind the scenes? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=158.2s)]
*  The Trump Organization agreed to partner on a real estate project in Qatar in the latest [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=163.64s)]
*  of a series of projects tied to foreign governments. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=170.04s)]
*  New Mideast Project is latest Trump company deal tied to a foreign government. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  New York Times just reports that matter of factly, Donald Trump cutting deals with Middle [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=179.48s)]
*  East countries, making himself billions of dollars while we the people suffer. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=184.32s)]
*  By the way, I've told you this story before, but it bears repeating again. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=189.52s)]
*  Don Jr. and Donald Trump's crypto czar, David Sachs, launching an exclusive club that they [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=193.8s)]
*  call the executive branch. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=201.4s)]
*  That's the name of their club. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=203.44s)]
*  It costs half a million dollars if you want to become a member of their executive branch [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=205.36s)]
*  club and get access to them. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  buying, you could buy access to them and it's just so open and obvious. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  Here's Donald Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick yesterday in this bizarre [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  interview with Rob Schmidt of Newsmax. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  Here Howard Lutnick says, look, just trust Donald Trump. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=231.88s)]
*  Just trust him. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=235.8s)]
*  This guy is the greatest deal maker who's ever lived. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=236.8s)]
*  Doesn't Howard Lutnick just give you the vibes of just like the biggest snake oil salesman [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=241.72s)]

*  When you don't bet on Donald Trump, you're making a mistake. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=256.52s)]
*  He understands. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  He's got great people around him. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=261.68s)]
*  Let him work through the process of getting a better deal from everybody else in the world. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=263.76s)]
*  We're going to do it smart. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=267.56s)]
*  We're going to do it thoughtfully. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=269.56s)]
*  We don't want to raise the price of these things like little toys on the shelf. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=271.0s)]
*  Why would we want to do that? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=275.68s)]
*  We love Americans. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=276.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=277.92s)]
*  But let him. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=278.92s)]
*  Folks, Donald Trump is literally the worst deal maker of all time. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=279.92s)]
*  Just go read Donald Trump's Securities and Exchange Commission filing for Trump Media. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=284.0s)]
*  Donald Trump bankrupted in the 90s, casino after casino. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=291.24s)]
*  And in the 2000s, bankrupted the reorganization of those casinos after casino. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=296.20000000000005s)]
*  He destroyed Atlantic City. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=301.12s)]
*  Donald Trump's never been a builder. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  He's a destroyer. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  He's bankrupted so many companies and he's destroyed so many companies that his name [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=305.64000000000004s)]
*  has been attached to. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  And he's doing the same scam and schemes now with the American economy. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=313.8s)]

*  Here's Jameson Greer, Donald Trump's top trade representative, being asked in this [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=320.92s)]
*  interview by Fox, have there been any talks at all with China? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=327.0s)]
*  There's a hundred and forty five percent tariffs against China. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=332.56s)]
*  The ships from the ports in China are not coming to the United States anymore. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=336.48s)]
*  We are heading towards a period of scarcity. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=341.68s)]
*  It's right around the corner where products are not going to be on shelves. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=344.20000000000005s)]
*  Here's what Jameson Greer, Trump's trade representative, says play this clip. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=348.68s)]
*  You know, for me, we're worried about the United States of America. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=378.68s)]
*  We have this giant trade deficit. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=382.52s)]
*  We have off-short manufacturing. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=384.2s)]
*  Our ag exports are way down. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=385.68s)]
*  It's affecting normal people in the country. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=387.32s)]
*  We want them to have jobs. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  We want them to have opportunities. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=391.96000000000004s)]
*  Obviously, China is a huge part of this and we want to make sure that we have fair trade [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=393.32s)]
*  with China. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=397.76s)]
*  And they're not official talks yet, right? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=398.76s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=400.92s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=401.92s)]
*  I did speak with my counterpart before April 2nd for a long time, over an hour. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=402.92s)]
*  It was a virtual meeting, but I thought it was constructive. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=407.04s)]
*  This is not a plan just to encircle China. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  It's a plan to fix the American economy, to have a greater share of manufacturing as GDP, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  to have real wages go up, to be producing things instead of having an economy that's [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=418.20000000000005s)]
*  financed by the government. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=423.44s)]
*  We want to make real stuff and sell it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=424.64000000000004s)]
*  It means we have to deal with foreign trade practices that are harmful, including in China [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=426.20000000000005s)]
*  and elsewhere. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=430.48s)]
*  Did you hear what he said? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=431.48s)]
*  This is Trump's top trade representative. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=432.92s)]
*  I want you to hear it in his own words, that there has not been a single discussion, not [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=434.76s)]
*  one since April 2nd, when Trump announced Liberation Day, which is liquidation or Great [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=440.68s)]
*  Recession Day. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=447.4s)]
*  Not one. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=448.84s)]
*  But Donald Trump says it's fine. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=450.76s)]
*  Donald Trump says suck it up. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=452.24s)]

*  Donald Trump mocks children getting toys. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=459.96s)]
*  Here's a photo of Donald Trump from what? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=465.64s)]
*  Probably 15, 20 years ago, or maybe more at this point. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=468.84s)]
*  Donald Trump, Melania, and that's Barron at the time. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=472.47999999999996s)]
*  Just look at where Donald Trump lives. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=476.64s)]
*  He literally lived in a penthouse that was, it's probably fake gold, who knows, but that's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=478.96s)]
*  made of gold. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=484.28s)]
*  He has a golden toilet bowl seat. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=485.56s)]
*  Not because he's a great businessman. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=488.8s)]
*  He inherited daddy's money. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=490.8s)]
*  His dad was uber wealthy. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=493.96s)]
*  Then Trump got into a fight with all of the family members over the inheritance. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=496.44s)]
*  I think I saw reports that if basically Donald Trump did almost nothing with the money, he'd [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=500.96s)]
*  have more money than had he done a lot of his failed endeavors. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=505.64s)]
*  But that's him over there. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=510.12s)]
*  Here's Donald Trump saying, look, who's going to really complain about the economy? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  Children who want more dolls? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=517.5600000000001s)]
*  Children who want their dolls? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=520.42s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=521.6s)]
*  Much of it we don't need. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=522.6s)]
*  You know, somebody said, oh, the shelves are going to be open. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=523.6s)]
*  Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know, and maybe the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=526.68s)]
*  two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=531.64s)]
*  But we're not talking about something that we have to go out of our way. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=534.52s)]
*  They have ships that are loaded up with stuff, much of which, not all of it, but much of [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=539.08s)]
*  which we don't need. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=544.2s)]
*  I mean, how tone deaf can you be? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=545.2s)]
*  And by the way, isn't that a literal war on Christmas that Donald Trump's saying? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=548.12s)]
*  Is it going after kids and kids wanting toys? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=553.1600000000001s)]
*  It's not just kids and toys, though, right? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=556.0s)]
*  It's going to be parts to air conditioning. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=557.6s)]
*  It's going to be lots of hardware parts. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=561.4000000000001s)]
*  And there's lots of products that we import from China. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=564.76s)]
*  It's not going to be arriving. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=568.48s)]
*  The ships are not coming. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=569.76s)]
*  And Donald Trump knows that. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=571.9599999999999s)]
*  That's why he's blaming next quarter on former President Biden. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=573.16s)]
*  All this guy does is blame, blame, blame. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=577.48s)]
*  Here was Donald Trump yesterday saying even next quarter is going to be bad because of [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=579.72s)]
*  former President Biden. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=583.0799999999999s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=584.0799999999999s)]
*  Look at the stock market in this case is it says how bad a situation we inherited. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=585.0799999999999s)]
*  I took place. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=590.6s)]
*  This is a quarter that we looked at today. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=591.68s)]
*  And I took, we took all of us together. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=594.52s)]
*  We came in on January 20th. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=598.64s)]
*  So this is Biden. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=600.2s)]
*  And you can even say the next quarter is sort of Biden because it doesn't just happen on [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=602.0400000000001s)]
*  a daily or a hourly basis. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=606.0s)]
*  What? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=608.9200000000001s)]
*  Former? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=609.9200000000001s)]
*  Next quarter? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=610.9200000000001s)]
*  I guess what? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  In 2029, it won't be Biden's fault anymore. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=612.9200000000001s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  I want to show you this as well because this video over here really hit home to me. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=616.76s)]
*  A Reuters drone captured detainees, Venezuelan detainees at the Blue Bonnet Immigrant Detention [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=624.28s)]
*  Center in Texas. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=632.0s)]
*  And you'll see these people here spelling out the message to the outside world. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=634.08s)]
*  SOS. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=638.44s)]
*  They need help. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=639.44s)]
*  No one has been able to get access to this Blue Bonnet facility. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=640.84s)]
*  That's where they go right before they get shipped to the concentration camp in El Salvador [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=644.36s)]
*  to be disappeared and never heard from again. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=648.78s)]
*  Here they are at this facility. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=652.46s)]
*  I mean, when you see this, you have to think to yourself, this is what America has become. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=654.14s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=659.98s)]
*  As Chris Hayes says, this is America now. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=682.46s)]
*  Your kids get a max of two toys, then they grow up, as Howard Lutnick said in another [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=694.5600000000001s)]
*  interview, to work in the same factory as their father and grandfather, screwing in [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=701.24s)]
*  tiny screws in an iPhone. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=706.82s)]
*  That's the American dream. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=709.6s)]
*  Take it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=711.62s)]
*  Take it. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=712.62s)]
*  I want to show you this as well. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=713.62s)]
*  Donald Trump was asked about his attacks on universities, his attacks on Harvard by Stephen [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=715.58s)]
*  A. Smith during an interview late last night. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=721.3000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump then confuses Harvard with Harlem and Donald Trump starts talking about getting [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=725.14s)]
*  black votes in Harlem. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=732.4200000000001s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=735.0s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you for your time. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=736.0s)]
*  It's interesting that you brought up Harvard because when people think about Harvard, what [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=737.92s)]
*  they're basically talking about is they're asking, what do you say to those who view [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=742.08s)]
*  your actions as an attack on academic freedom rather than a defense of fairness? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=745.8000000000001s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=751.96s)]
*  Well, I say this. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=752.96s)]
*  We had riots in Harlem and frankly, if you look at what's gone on and people from Harlem [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=755.1s)]
*  and they protested, Stephen, and they protested very strongly against Harvard. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=762.86s)]
*  They happened to be on my side. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=767.74s)]
*  You know, I got a very high black vote. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=769.1800000000001s)]
*  You know that very, very high black vote. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=772.5s)]
*  It was a very great compliment. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=774.98s)]
*  I did criminal justice reform. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=777.4200000000001s)]
*  I did opportunity zones for one of the greatest economic deals ever for the black and Hispanic [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=779.5s)]
*  community. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=787.02s)]
*  I got tremendous. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=788.02s)]
*  They agree with what I'm doing with respect to Harvard. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=789.26s)]
*  Harvard gets four or five. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=792.34s)]
*  And finally, I want to report that Mohsen Madhawi, who is a permanent resident here [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=794.84s)]
*  in the United States, was released based on the order of a federal judge. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=800.2800000000001s)]
*  He was one of the leaders in the protest of Columbia. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=805.32s)]
*  And let me just read for you what the federal judge said in this order. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=811.24s)]
*  Jeffrey Crawford, the judge in Wednesday's ruling, wrote that those who know Madhawi [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=817.1999999999999s)]
*  describe him as a peaceful figure who seeks consensus in a highly charged political environment. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=822.0999999999999s)]
*  Judge Crawford added though, even if he were a firebrand, his conduct is protected by [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=828.4599999999999s)]
*  the First Amendment. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=834.16s)]
*  The court is aware that he has offended his political opponents and apparently given rise [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=836.38s)]
*  to concerns at the State Department that he is an obstacle to American foreign policy [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=841.16s)]
*  based on his support of Palestine. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=846.68s)]
*  Such conduct is insufficient to support a finding that he is in any way a danger as [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=849.56s)]
*  we use the term in the context of detention and release. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=854.12s)]
*  Legal residents like Madhawi, not charged with crimes or misconduct, are being arrested [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=858.66s)]
*  and threatened with deportation for stating their views on political issues of the day [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=864.3199999999999s)]
*  and for Madhawi it's a free Palestine. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=870.46s)]
*  Crawford said, citing the Red Scare and McCarthy-era targeting of political people for their views, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=873.3s)]
*  the wheel of history has come around again, but as before, these times of excess will pass. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=879.02s)]
*  I think we have to make sure that we're fighting for it to pass. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=887.36s)]
*  It's not inevitable that it will pass. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=890.8199999999999s)]
*  And what we try to do here on the Midas Touch Network every day is highlight the authoritarian [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=892.8199999999999s)]
*  tactics of this Trump regime. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZCrkaT8E4&t=897.68s)]
