# Trump has DISASTER SUNDAY and LOSES IT in Public
**MeidasTouch:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno)
*  What's a matter Donald? You're having a terrible Easter. Is it because millions of people across the world and in the United States [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=0.0s)]
*  protested your regime once again this weekend? Is it because your approval is plummeting? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=8.38s)]
*  Americans think you're handling the economy [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=15.14s)]
*  disastrously. Is it because Donald, no countries want to cut a deal with you because you've extorted them over and over again? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=18.44s)]
*  Is it because little kids are going to the protests and mocking you and mocking your regime? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=27.5s)]
*  Why is it Donald? Is it because Easter is a time when people spend the day with their family and show love and empathy and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=33.74s)]
*  you don't know what that means. All you have is vile hate in your heart. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=42.7s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump is posting this morning on Easter. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=48.379999999999995s)]
*  Donald Trump posts, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=52.64s)]
*  Pause. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=72.96s)]
*  Donald, you are a felon. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=74.4s)]
*  You Donald are a criminal. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=77.44s)]
*  You are a sexual abuser. You were found liable for sexual assault. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=84.32s)]
*  Hey Donald, you are a fraud. I think if anyone needs to go to El Salvador, frankly, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=89.52s)]
*  it's you and other criminals in your regime. But I digress. Let me keep on reading. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=95.92s)]
*  Trump goes, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=101.84s)]
*  He puts that in caps. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=106.72s)]
*  Like a little baby. No offense to little petulant babies, Donald, because they have far more maturity than you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=127.84s)]
*  But yes, Donald, it's what a nine to zero Supreme Court ruling saying, you know what? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=135.2s)]
*  We are a nation of due process facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=140.96s)]
*  Is that the radical left ineffective judges you're talking about Donald or how about the fourth circuit court of appeal judge? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=146.72s)]
*  Judge Wilkinson, a Reagan appointee whose law clerks go on to work at the Supreme Court. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=155.04s)]
*  Someone who's viewed as one of the biggest conservative judges in this country said that what you are doing is so [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=161.76s)]
*  unlawful and authoritarian and wrote one of the most scathing opinions ever. Is that one of these leftist ineffective [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=169.5s)]
*  judges or maybe Donald you're a felon. You're a criminal. You're a fraud. You're a liar. Heck, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=177.68s)]
*  even Justice Alito's dissent in that emergency order blocking [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  the additional group of victims in Texas, the migrants to be sent to the concentration camp in El Salvador. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=190.0s)]
*  He was saying you need to comply with the order to provide due process to each of the migrants. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=196.88s)]
*  Justice Alito though said well, we believe that the Trump administration is going to do that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=204.16s)]
*  and he's going to follow our order while seven other justices of the Supreme Court said we don't trust you, Donald. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=209.52s)]
*  Donald Trump went on to post the following on Easter morning. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=216.56s)]
*  We are together [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=220.4s)]
*  going to make America bigger, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=222.48s)]
*  better, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=225.2s)]
*  stronger, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=226.3s)]
*  wealthier, healthier, and more religious than it has ever been before. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=227.42s)]
*  And then he puts this in caps because he's a deranged demented lunatic. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=233.44s)]
*  Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America! [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=238.0s)]
*  Exclamation point, exclamation point, exclamation point. Well, why don't we go in reverse order there, Donald? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  You want to make America more religious? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=247.36s)]
*  This is coming from, again, you, a sexual abuser, somebody who brags about [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=250.16000000000003s)]
*  sexually assaulting women and you say because you are rich, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=254.94000000000003s)]
*  they let you get away with it and then you go and speak in front of a group of young [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=258.08000000000004s)]
*  Republican teenagers and say that you heard that was one of the most courageous things you've ever done calling [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=262.38s)]
*  sexually harassing woman locker room talk and that that makes you a strong person. Okay, let's keep going healthier. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  You appoint an anti-vaxxer, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=275.28s)]
*  RFK Jr. to say the most hateful things about autism, to already spread lies, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=277.65999999999997s)]
*  and now we have measles outbreaks throughout the country as you gut the NIH, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  CDC, and as you attack people's Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security, wealthier. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=289.02s)]
*  Hey, Donald, the last time I looked at the markets, they are down [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=295.2s)]
*  significantly down off their highs under former President Biden. In terms of wealthier, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=300.14s)]
*  have people look at their 401ks and pensions and life savings. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=306.08s)]
*  I think the facts, Donald, although you don't live in facts, you live in fraud, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=309.44s)]
*  speak for themselves that you are a disaster on the economy. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=314.0s)]
*  So no wonder the new CNBC poll shows your approval on the economy dropping to the lowest [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  of even your first term as well, lower than it even was during COVID. Oh, by the way, Donald, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  your approval rating among Republicans and GOP leaning independents has fallen [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=330.56s)]
*  15% at this point. 15%, Donald. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=336.38s)]
*  America absolutely hates you. We're going to make us stronger. We're weaker by far. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=340.64s)]
*  You have China now cutting deals with Japan, South Korea, Europe, Australia. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  You have NATO looking elsewhere. America is isolated as a pariah regime [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  viewed by the world as even weirder than Kim Jong-un, Donald. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  So definitely didn't make us stronger and you're going to make us bigger and better, bigger and better, Donald. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=360.0s)]
*  In what way? By threatening to annex and conquer our allies who are now [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  boycotting the United States of America's products and tourism. Our tourism is down so significantly [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=372.06s)]
*  from Canada and Europe and elsewhere. It's going to cost our nation at least [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=379.14s)]
*  90 billion dollars and frankly, I think it's going to be more than that. But you don't care, Donald. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=384.48s)]
*  There you are with Elon Musk and your billionaire buddies [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=389.7s)]
*  writing your stupid tweets and your dumb posts on Easter like a petulant little three-year-old. No offense to petulant, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=393.46s)]
*  three-year-olds. This time of year, it's time to shake off those winter blues and get ready for a fresh start and that includes your hair. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=401.38s)]
*  I've been using the iRestore Elite and I've got to say I was skeptical at first, but this thing is legit. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=406.98s)]
*  I pop it on when I'm watching TV or answering emails completely hands-free, super comfortable, and honestly kind of relaxing. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=411.62s)]
*  Over time, I started noticing less shedding and more regrowth, especially around my temples where I noticed a little bit of thinning. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=417.94s)]
*  I've tried other LED devices before, but none of them felt this effortless or gave me these kinds of results. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=423.21999999999997s)]
*  The iRestore Elite is in a league of its own with 282 lasers and LEDs that deliver light therapy right to your scalp. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=428.26s)]
*  It's like a spa day for your hair follicles. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=434.98s)]
*  So give yourself the gift of hair confidence this spring. For a limited time only our listeners get [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=437.14s)]
*  $625 off their iRestore Elite when you use code MIDAS at iRestoreLaser.com. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=442.4s)]

*  $625 off your iRestore Elite at iRestoreLaser.com with promo code MIDAS. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=449.44s)]
*  Please support our show and tell them we sent you. Hair loss is frustrating. You don't have to fight it alone. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=457.86s)]
*  Thanks to iRestore. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=462.82s)]
*  Oh, and then you posted this this morning. You posted state regime media fox. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=465.38s)]
*  And here's the chyron from fox. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=471.14s)]
*  Experts warn [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=473.44s)]
*  China poised to interfere in Trump tariff deal with EU. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=474.98s)]
*  I want you to watch this video that Donald Trump posted. I'm only going to show you like 30 seconds of it [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=480.66s)]
*  because the fox host goes what a difference that administration makes. China is so frazzled. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=485.38s)]
*  They're so scared of the United States. They're now cutting deals with the European Union and they're blocking [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=490.9s)]
*  Donald Trump from doing deals with the European Union on tariffs. Look how good Donald Trump is doing. I'm watching this and I'm like [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=498.18s)]
*  look, North Korea is watching this and saying can we get these people to help Kim Jong-un? Here watch this. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=505.78s)]
*  Fox News contributor and author of the 100 year marathon Michael Pillsbury joins us now. Michael always great to have you on. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=511.86s)]
*  So first of all, what a difference a president makes. I've never seen China on the hot seat like this in a long time. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=519.54s)]
*  Tell us what you're seeing and what you expect with this. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=526.58s)]
*  Potentially seeing China interfere with this EU trade deal because it seems like that's the only way they can go. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=529.92s)]
*  Well, the Chinese want a much better deal with the Europeans than than they have with us. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=537.46s)]
*  But y'all see what's going on there, right? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=542.58s)]
*  The European Union's like why would we cut deals with you Donald and extortionist? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=544.6600000000001s)]
*  Okay, the European Union sent its chief negotiator to talk about the tariffs and left saying what the hell is Donald Trump even talking about? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=550.26s)]
*  Japan's chief negotiator left the White House without a deal saying what are these crazy people in the White House even talking about? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=557.84s)]
*  Trump can't even cut deals with our allies on these reciprocal tariffs, which are based on a [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=565.3000000000001s)]
*  fake and fraudulent formula. Surprise surprise, the fraud makes fraudulent formulas to attack allies [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=571.62s)]
*  more than adversaries. And by the way, that formula was not applied to Russia. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=578.34s)]
*  It was not applied to the Taliban, but it was applied to the European Union and to penguins and to our own military bases [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=582.74s)]
*  on foreign islands. Absolutely ridiculous. And speaking of absolutely ridiculous, on Easter, here's the headline from Politico. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=590.18s)]
*  Bunkers crazy pants, American diplomats shaken by reports of new State Department cuts. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=597.86s)]
*  Proported executive order by Donald Trump, which is going to be released this week, calls for slashing State Department offices and bureaus, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=604.26s)]
*  overhauling how diplomatic posts work, getting rid of like all of these diplomatic outposts that promote democracy in Africa and Europe and elsewhere. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=612.08s)]
*  One US diplomat described the draft to Politico as [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=621.06s)]
*  Bunkers crazy pants. You could give infinite monkeys, infinite typewriters, and they would come up with something better than that. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=624.5s)]
*  And this follows the State Department shutting down its foreign offices to block Russian disinformation [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=633.62s)]
*  because Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in an actual release, this is real, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=641.22s)]
*  says, protecting and championing free speech at the State Department, that Russia's [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=647.3s)]
*  disinformation campaign in the US is a form of free speech that should be promoted. That's in his release right there. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=654.0s)]
*  There you have it. Trump's Easter will keep you posted with more here on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTVxbA8Wno&t=662.3399999999999s)]
