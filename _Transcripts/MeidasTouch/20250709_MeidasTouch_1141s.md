# Trump PANICS on WEDNESDAY as he CANâ€™T STOP HIS CRASH
**MeidasTouch:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo)
*  Well, here he goes again, Donald Trump ranting and raving like a lunatic and panicking in public on his social media platform like a deranged third grader. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=0.0s)]
*  No offense to deranged third graders who are far more mature. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=11.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is posting the following, leave the great former president of Brazil alone. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=15.0s)]
*  Witch hunt exclamation point. He's talking about Jair Bolsonaro, who led an insurrection in Brazil. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=22.0s)]
*  Donald Trump then posted, I brought down costs more than any president in recorded history. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=29.0s)]
*  The crooked Democrats are using the opposite narrative, even though they know it is a total lie. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=36.0s)]
*  And lie is all in caps. Remember this when you hear their phony sound bites. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=43.0s)]
*  Maga exclamation point exclamation point exclamation point. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=48.0s)]
*  Okay, prices are up right now. We know that when we go to stores, there's a reason why online shopping right now is at a like a low for the decade. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=52.0s)]
*  It's Amazon Prime Day and Amazon Prime Day. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=66.0s)]
*  We're seeing a massive drop in sales there, and we're seeing a massive drop across online shopping in general right now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=69.0s)]
*  You can threaten your oligarch friends to remove notifications on their websites that the reason for price increases is because of tariffs. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=78.0s)]
*  But we the people understand that tariffs are taxes on the importers, which are passed to consumers. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=87.0s)]
*  We are the ones being taxed. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=93.0s)]
*  Then Donald Trump continues to attack the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, this morning. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=95.0s)]
*  He goes anybody but too late. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=102.0s)]
*  And he puts that in all caps. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=105.0s)]
*  Anybody but too late. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=107.0s)]
*  That's the nickname that he gives to the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=109.0s)]
*  He calls him too late. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=115.0s)]
*  Donald Trump appointed Jerome Powell. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=117.0s)]
*  And this is why the United States dollar is off to the worst start since 1973. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=120.0s)]
*  Because increasingly America is becoming less and less the world's reserve currency with the dollar because people see an unstable madman running the United States like a psycho-authoritarian. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=126.0s)]
*  Then Donald Trump posts, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=139.0s)]
*  The hottest country in the world. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=156.0s)]
*  Lower the rate. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=158.0s)]
*  He goes the hottest. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=159.0s)]
*  We're so hot is what he likes to always say over and over again. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=160.0s)]
*  There's a reason why the chairman of the Federal Reserve is an independent position because the interference in this case that Donald Trump is engaging in is what causes massive, massive problems in an economy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=164.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump continuing to do that is going to cause massive systemic problems that we're seeing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=180.0s)]
*  Also, Donald Trump was posting his letters all morning like a letter to the Sultan of Brunei, letting them know you are now hereby tariffed 25% Sultan of Brunei. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=187.0s)]
*  Donald Trump also tariffed the Philippines 20%, Moldova 25%, Algeria 30%, Iraq 30%, and Libya 30%. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=200.0s)]
*  And here's just so you can see Donald Trump's letter that he posted to the Sultan of Brunei. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=210.0s)]
*  It is a great honor for me to send you this letter and that it demonstrates the strength and commitment of our trading relationship and the fact that the United States of America has agreed to continue working with Brunei. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=215.0s)]
*  Despite having a significant trade deficit with your great country. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=226.0s)]
*  Nevertheless, we have decided to move forward with you, but only with a more balanced and fair trade. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=229.0s)]
*  Therefore, we invite you to participate in the extraordinary economy of the United States, the number one market in the world. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=234.0s)]
*  Sultan, by far we have had years to discuss our trading relationships with Brunei. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=240.0s)]
*  And have concluded that we must move away from these long term and very persistent trade deficits engendered by Brunei's tariffs and non-tariff policies and trade barriers. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=245.0s)]
*  Our relationship has been unfortunately far from reciprocal, Sultan. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=261.0s)]
*  Starting on August 1, 2025, we will charge Brunei only 25% on any and all Bruneian products sent into the United States. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=265.0s)]
*  Separate from all sectoral tariffs, goods transship to evade a higher tariff will be subject to the higher tariff. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=277.0s)]
*  What are we talking about here? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=284.0s)]
*  Of course there is going to be a deficit with Brunei. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=286.0s)]
*  I don't even fully know our trading relationship with Brunei. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=289.0s)]
*  But what do we expect is going to happen? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=292.0s)]
*  All of a sudden the people in Brunei are just going to start buying all of these American products. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=294.0s)]
*  It's the most ridiculous letter I've ever read. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=298.0s)]
*  As I noted earlier in this video, Amazon's Prime Day sales fell almost 14% in the first hours of the event. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=301.0s)]
*  Compared with the start of last year's sale, according to Momentum Commerce, which manages 50 brands in a variety of product categories, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=309.0s)]
*  also online shopping sees its biggest slowdown in over a decade as tariffs disrupt e-commerce. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=317.0s)]
*  Trump's trade war and tariff policies are contributing to the first widespread pullback in the online sales category growth in over a decade, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=324.0s)]
*  according to a new survey on home delivery trends from Alex Partners. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=334.0s)]
*  Most major product categories are experiencing significant declines in consumer buying, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=339.0s)]
*  with groceries one of the only exceptions. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=344.0s)]
*  Carl Quintanilla also posts that the US is having the worst year for measles spread in more than three decades. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=348.0s)]
*  One thing I want to point out as well is that if you look at all of the other data that's out there from all of these third party sources pretty much, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=358.0s)]
*  other than the White House, these are all recessionary data out there. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=368.0s)]
*  You go even to tourism sectors, you go into construction, you go into what I reported last week, the ADP private payroll data. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=373.0s)]
*  But somehow the White House data, right after they fired all the civil servants and the experts, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=384.0s)]
*  they show 147,000 jobs being created, not in the private sector, but in the government sector when they said Doge was cutting government jobs. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=390.0s)]
*  Hmm, that's quite interesting right there. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=401.0s)]
*  And the data and the people who are out there from the Trump regime spewing this nonsense are people like this, Peter Navarro. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=406.0s)]
*  So Peter Navarro, one of Donald Trump's top advisors, was on Fox this morning and he was asked, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=414.0s)]
*  so are we going to get clarity for the business community about what's going on or where countries know what the tariff rates are? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=421.0s)]
*  Are we going to get clarity? And Navarro goes, what are you talking about? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=429.0s)]
*  We have clarity. Everybody's clear what the tariffs are. Everybody knows Trump is sending letters. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=433.0s)]
*  And if there's a deficit, that's a tariff. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=440.0s)]
*  If there's a... notice what he says about trade deficits, because this is what underlies Trump's entire disastrous trade war. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=443.0s)]
*  This idea that if there is a deficit with another country, that they are somehow exploiting us and taking advantage and screwing us. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=452.0s)]
*  When the United States was the richest country in the world, it fundamentally doesn't understand the most basic economic principles. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=461.0s)]
*  But here, play this clip. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=467.0s)]
*  Do you think we are going to get clarity, say, by the end of the summer in terms of what countries are paying what price, what the tariffs look like? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=468.0s)]
*  Because the uncertainty of it, he believes, and others do as well, is what's keeping some businesses from investing today. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=476.0s)]
*  Well, if I were a market analyst, instead of working at the White House, it would be very simple for me to have clarity on all this. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=486.0s)]
*  I would simply look at all the different countries. I'd look at the size of the trade deficit that the U.S. runs with those countries. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=494.0s)]
*  And I would be able to be very easily calibrate where the optimal tariff would likely land, given President Trump's insistence that [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=502.0s)]
*  we have a level playing field and that we reduce or eliminate our trade deficit for national security. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=513.0s)]
*  So I think that there's tremendous clarity right now. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=520.0s)]
*  The president has been very clear about what the goal is and how he's going to get there. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=523.0s)]
*  There's been, we had the initial reciprocal tariffs, we rolled back to give folks time. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=528.0s)]
*  And now letters have gone out which calibrate more. So I think there's plenty of clarity. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=535.0s)]
*  Did you hear what he said right there? I mean, if you think about it, it's like we're attacking Japan right now. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=542.0s)]
*  And Trump continues to go after Japan, Japan. They're the biggest employer of any foreign country of Americans. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=548.0s)]
*  They hold the most treasury bonds of any foreign country, like by far. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=555.0s)]
*  They're the biggest investor in America from any foreign country. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=560.0s)]
*  You know, so you look at Canada. Canada is a close second in a lot of those categories as well. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=564.0s)]
*  I mean, you go to Europe. I mean, you go elsewhere. You look at who is the United States going after. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=568.0s)]
*  And it's people who help the United States get rich, not taking advantage. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=573.0s)]
*  It's a very strange. It's a very strange victimy kind of view. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=579.0s)]
*  But that's what MAGA is all about. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=583.0s)]
*  They've created smart sleep solutions that help families get the rest they desperately need, starting with SNU. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=598.0s)]
*  SNU Smart Sleeper is a responsive bassinet that uses gentle rocking and white noise to soothe babies to sleep. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=605.0s)]
*  It can add one to two hours of extra rest each night and automatically responds when babies fuss. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=612.0s)]
*  So you can stay asleep too. Very important for me. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=618.0s)]
*  It's the only bassinet that's FDA de novo authorized to keep sleeping babies safely on their backs. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=622.0s)]
*  It's trusted in over 180 hospitals. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=629.0s)]
*  And now companies like JPMorgan Chase, Google, Red Bull, Activision, Blizzard, Yeti, Barstool, Sports, Rare Beauty, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=631.0s)]
*  and others are offering free SNU rentals as a benefit for their employees to help new parents get more rest. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=638.0s)]
*  Want your company to give you a free SNU? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=645.0s)]
*  Go to happiestbaby.com slash referral to refer your employer. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=648.0s)]
*  You could also be eligible for up to $10,000 if they join the program. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=653.0s)]
*  Or head to happiestbaby.com slash mitis and use the code MITIS to get 20% off SNU and other smart sleep solutions [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=658.0s)]
*  like their award-winning Sleepia Swaddle and the Snooby Smart White Noise Machine today. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=667.0s)]
*  Every family deserves better sleep. And for me, I can tell you, it's been a lifesaver for me and my wife. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=673.0s)]
*  So go ahead there. happiestbaby.com slash mitis. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=680.0s)]
*  You know, and it's all about excuses with them. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=683.0s)]
*  And let me just show you what went down this morning as well, because it was telling. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=686.0s)]
*  So the mayor of Kerrville, which was subject to those catastrophic floods in the flash floods from the Guadalupe River. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=690.0s)]
*  So they were holding a press conference. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=698.0s)]
*  And one of the things that I note is that you would normally see here the head of FEMA right there or you would see one of, you know, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=700.0s)]
*  you know, the feds right there because on their own, you're going to see like them. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=708.0s)]
*  I'll show you what the mayor of Kerrville was doing right. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=713.0s)]
*  And as Aaron Rupert says, the Kerrville mayor seems like a real peach. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=716.0s)]
*  Like this is why you need the feds to be involved in things like this, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=721.0s)]
*  because there's a certain things that localities can't do are incapable of. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=725.0s)]
*  And this is just offensive as can be. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=730.0s)]
*  But watch the mayor of Kerrville from this morning play this clip. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=732.0s)]
*  I'm married to a retired first grade teacher. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=736.0s)]
*  And I learned a little bit about classroom management from her. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=742.0s)]
*  If you yell questions at us, we're probably going to pick someone else to answer. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=747.0s)]
*  OK, so you feel the need to yell your questions. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=752.0s)]
*  I will feel the need to not answer your question. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=757.0s)]
*  In first grade, they raised their hands. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=760.0s)]
*  That might be a good start. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=763.0s)]
*  Yesterday was a disaster and I was embarrassed. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=765.0s)]
*  Our town was embarrassed. Your viewers were embarrassed. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=770.0s)]
*  And I don't want that to happen again. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=776.0s)]
*  OK, you want to see the Kerr County Sheriff? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=778.0s)]
*  It don't get much better. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=780.0s)]
*  And this is what happened. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=782.0s)]
*  I'm not making excuses for these people. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=783.0s)]
*  I mean, this is some, you know, what I'm watching here is the height of incompetence. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=785.0s)]
*  But this is why you need the feds to come in and be helpful in situations and take a leadership role. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=790.0s)]
*  It's a major issue. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=797.0s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=799.0s)]
*  Ernie's going to give a case at 12, San Antonio. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=800.0s)]
*  Question for the sheriff. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=802.0s)]
*  The code red alert system has come under a lot of scrutiny in recent days. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=804.0s)]
*  And now there's reports of a timeline on Friday morning where an Ingram volunteer fired a pregnant commander, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=809.0s)]
*  asked a Kerr County Sheriff dispatcher for the code red to be issued. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=816.0s)]
*  The dispatcher says, I can't. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=823.0s)]
*  I have to get a supervisor's approval for that. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=825.0s)]
*  Almost six hours passes until 10 o'clock, when 1004, when the code red is issued. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=828.0s)]
*  How do you account for that lapse of time? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=835.0s)]
*  What happened and what could have happened in that time? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=837.0s)]
*  As I said earlier, with every significant event, you know, we're going with every emergency, you know, we're going to have to. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=840.0s)]
*  There's going to be an after action. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=848.0s)]
*  Please, y'all listen to those words after action. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=850.0s)]
*  OK, so that was the Kerr County Sheriff right there. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=852.0s)]
*  And then I showed you this clip in the 7 a.m. Eastern, 4 a.m. Pacific video that I did of the of the Texas Governor Abbott. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=855.0s)]
*  And he's out there basically saying, you know, you know, stop blaming people. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=864.0s)]
*  You know, in football, you don't blame people. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=869.0s)]
*  This is like football. We're winners in Texas. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=871.0s)]
*  We're winners. We don't like losers. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=874.0s)]
*  Stop criticizing our response and the feds response. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=876.0s)]
*  We're football players, football players. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=879.0s)]
*  What the hell are you talking about? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=882.0s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=883.0s)]
*  Second party question needs to be addressed. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=884.0s)]
*  You ask, I'm going to use your words. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=887.0s)]
*  Who's to blame? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=889.0s)]
*  Know this. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=891.0s)]
*  That's the word choice of losers. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=893.0s)]
*  Let me explain one thing about Texas. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=896.0s)]
*  And that is Texas. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=899.0s)]
*  Every square inch of our state cares about football. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=901.0s)]
*  You could be in Hunt, Texas, Huntsville, Texas, Houston, Texas, any size community that care about football. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=905.0s)]
*  High school, Friday night lights, college football or pro. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=911.0s)]
*  And know this. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=916.0s)]
*  Every football team makes mistakes. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=917.0s)]
*  The losing teams are the ones that try to point out who's to blame. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=920.0s)]
*  The championship teams are the ones that say, don't worry about it, man. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=924.0s)]
*  We got this. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=928.0s)]
*  We're going to make sure that we go score again that we're going to win this game. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=929.0s)]
*  The way winners talk is not to point fingers. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=933.0s)]
*  They talk about solutions. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=936.0s)]
*  You're football players. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=938.0s)]
*  What does it even mean? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=939.0s)]
*  Look, as I mentioned before, there were six major vacancies at the National Weather Service [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=940.0s)]
*  and key federal positions that would have been assigned to this Kirk County area, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=946.0s)]
*  including the main meteorologist coordinator, the local officials. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=951.0s)]
*  You heard from some of them there. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=955.0s)]
*  They claim that they didn't get the notifications from the feds. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=957.0s)]
*  The feds say that those local officials are basically the ones who should be leading everything when we know what should have happened in a situation like this is that you see the storms coming. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=960.0s)]
*  The feds have regional managers and people in place. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=971.0s)]
*  They are working together, making sure everybody gets the notifications, that resources are prepositioned, that a recovery effort is ready right away. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=974.0s)]
*  And you kick into high gear. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=984.0s)]
*  Donald Trump was golfing all weekend. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=987.0s)]
*  He was like licking ice cream cones. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=989.0s)]
*  It was really gross in a situation just in a normal situation. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=991.0s)]
*  I don't care whether you're Democrat, Republican. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=995.0s)]
*  The president would be in the situation room or a war room or something surrounded by everybody. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=997.0s)]
*  Surrounded by everybody coordinating every single aspect of this. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1002.0s)]
*  Finally, let me show you Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries calling for Pete Hegsith to resign. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1008.0s)]
*  Democratic leader Jeffries like like I, you know, are calling for Hegsith to resign. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1014.0s)]
*  According to Trump, Trump said that he was not aware that Hegsith ordered that the military weapons not be sent to Ukraine. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1019.0s)]
*  All right. So either Trump is lying and Trump knew about it, which I'm sure is probably also true. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1029.0s)]
*  But if Hegsith on his own stopped military weapons that were supposed to go to Ukraine without telling anybody, of course you fire him. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1034.0s)]
*  If you don't fire him, then you accept and you embrace and you ratify that conduct, which is patently unlawful and crazy. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1042.0s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1052.0s)]
*  What do you think? What does this say about the relationship between President Trump and the defense secretary? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1053.0s)]
*  He's Hegsith is the most unqualified defense secretary in American history. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1061.0s)]
*  He undermines the ability of the Department of Defense to keep the American people safe. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1066.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump should fire him or Pete Hegsith should tender his resignation. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1072.0s)]
*  That's been clear and apparent for months. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1077.0s)]
*  And it's shocking to me that this charade continues to go on. Ukraine is an ally. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1080.0s)]
*  Russia is a sworn enemy of the United States of America. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1087.0s)]
*  And when you limit Ukraine's ability to be successful in the war of aggression that Russia has launched against a sovereign country, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1091.0s)]
*  you undermine America's national security interests. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1100.0s)]
*  And that's highly problematic. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1104.0s)]
*  Very strong words. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1106.0s)]
*  Very strong words. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1109.0s)]
*  I should just say Trump says there you have it, folks. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1110.0s)]
*  Let me know what you think. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pAgQeZdWo&t=1113.0s)]
