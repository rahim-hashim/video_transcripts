# Fox News CRASHES ON AIR as Trump SCREWS THEM
**MeidasTouch:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY)
*  State regime media known as Fox is really struggling as Donald Trump torpedoes our economy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, they're doing their best as state regime media trying to pump up Trump's lies [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=7.26s)]
*  But it's just belied by the data. There's really nothing they can do [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=12.48s)]
*  I mean Fox is trapped right now, you know [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  They previously brought on Trump's top economic adviser Kevin Hassett who said things are great. There's 100% [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=19.26s)]
*  100% guarantee he says no recession, but we'll show you what they're now saying but here's Kevin Hassett. Let's play it real quick [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=26.42s)]
*  Are you expecting a recession this year? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=33.260000000000005s)]
*  100% not 100% not if you look at the jobs numbers, they're very very strong [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=36.14s)]
*  Would I talk anecdotally to CEOs? I say things like well, geez is the uncertainty over tariffs looking like it's gonna be a big drag [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=39.980000000000004s)]
*  And they're saying they're saying things like no in terms of production [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=46.82000000000001s)]
*  We're getting as much onshore as we can and in terms of sales of Ford goods [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=50.1s)]
*  People are buying as many as they can because they're worried about future terrorists. So everything's through the roof [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=54.42s)]
*  Well now even the guests on Fox are saying look [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=58.900000000000006s)]
*  There's a reason why Donald Trump is being viewed by the American people as being the worst on [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=62.46s)]
*  Economy the economy ever here play this clip. I will say is she's talking about health care. She's talking about Medicaid [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=69.42s)]
*  She's talking about Social Security [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=75.38s)]
*  Whether we think this is resonating or not currently President Trump is ten points underwater in the economy [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=76.94s)]
*  And she's out talking about it. Like I said not where I stand [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=83.28s)]
*  Yeah, but I think she's resonating more than we're giving her credit for Julian very quick [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=86.64s)]
*  You know [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=90.52s)]
*  So they try to pivot and they try to act like Donald Trump sending migrants to El Salvador is this incredibly [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=90.72s)]
*  Courageous thing and they just they spread all of these lies. It's it's so bizarre [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=97.8s)]
*  I mean take a look here one of the Fox hosts is saying so why are we having United States senators? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=101.88s)]
*  You know promote terrorists shouldn't he be fighting for his own constituents here watch this [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=108.22s)]
*  Especially as someone who believes in enforcing laws since when do we have elected officials like senators that are promoting and and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=113.66s)]
*  Helping this individual to be in our country and wanting to bring him back [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=120.82s)]
*  I wish that he would fight that hard for his own constituents [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=123.9s)]
*  I mean, I just it is shocking that when the it shouldn't be shot [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=126.28s)]
*  Nothing shocks me with the with Fox, but when the Supreme Court rules nine to zero [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=130.1s)]
*  Facilitate the return of a brego Garcia when the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=135.16s)]
*  Being led by a right-wing Reagan appointed judge judge Wilkinson [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  Makes it very clear that I mean this is a threat and all American citizens and Fox is doing this [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=147.12s)]
*  I mean Kim Jong-un would be like wow [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=151.72s)]
*  Here's that same Fox host saying look if I look at Bu Kelly the leader of El Salvador [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=154.12s)]
*  And he goes Bu Kelly seems to be more patriotic than the Democrats and again you have Fox [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=160.12s)]
*  Promoting the authoritarian leader of El Salvador watch this. It's night and day you think that you're in two different countries [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean I look at President Bukele, and he is not even American and he seems to be our bigger proponent than [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=173.28s)]
*  You know the senator and he's saying look we're not we're not sending him back to the United States [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  El Salvador is like we're not going to do that and Attorney General Pam Bond is like look if he's not sending him back [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=183.44s)]
*  This is really a moot point [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=188.2s)]
*  We don't need to worry [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  But it is that very stark contrast and I find it very very troubling especially as someone who believes in enforcing laws [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  You know it's interesting to see Maria Bartiroma [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  Who works so hard to help with the propaganda for the Trump regime? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  But even when she brings on these mega Republicans like Beth Van Dunn [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=203.56s)]
*  It's like come on here play this clip [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  And that's that's the state that they're willing to die on if that's the hill they want to go on god bless them [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=211.04s)]
*  So I mean look it was a mistake the administration said it was a mistake [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=215.98s)]
*  It might have been a mistake [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=220.34s)]
*  But they're picking the one straw out of an entire barn full and what we need to focus on is the 20 million that we're [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=221.89999999999998s)]
*  Allowed to enter here people on the terrorist watch list people from drug cartels [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what this administration you can pull one example out [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=232.94s)]
*  But if that is literally the person that they're gonna that they're gonna hail as as they're on you know savior for this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=236.42s)]
*  I think it's a mistake. Yeah, it's incredible actually [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=242.7s)]
*  You've got a new bill which you could tell there that even Maria Bartiroma a major propagandist is like [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  What who she knows these people are idiots Bartiroma knows the Fox business anchor Cheryl [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  Cassone then suggests brings on this mega Republican congressmember. This is the guy who took a [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=259.8s)]
*  Congressmember Moore who took the photo with his thumbs up in front of the concentration cells in El Salvador [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=267.08s)]
*  Just that they suggest there's some big conspiracy theory behind senator van Hollens meeting with Garcia play this clip [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=273.12s)]
*  I want to call for senator Chris van Hollen to meet with the family of Rachel [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=280.68s)]
*  Moran the murdered woman in Maryland the mother of five children [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=287.56s)]
*  He has not met with her at all, but he's meeting with an MS 13 gang member down in El Salvador [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=293.26s)]
*  I'm calling for senator Chris van Hollen to meet with Rachel [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=300.85999999999996s)]
*  Moran's family and give them at least the same amount of time that he is giving to an MS 13 gang member [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=305.14s)]
*  Patty Moran Rachel Warren's mother is gonna be joining our program later on this morning [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=312.17999999999995s)]
*  I just want to let our viewers know and we're gonna get her reaction to these pictures as well [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=317.05999999999995s)]
*  It looks like they're sitting outside and he's got civilian clothing on and it appears to be a restaurant [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=321.4s)]
*  So we're trying to understand was this stage [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=327.5s)]
*  Exactly. What was the point did van Hollen somehow stage the way that this appeared to be the civilian clothing? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=332.34s)]
*  I think is the biggest question mark [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=337.58s)]
*  So we'll get to the bottom of that one so then Fox brings on the State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=338.82s)]
*  And again as Michael Cohen not Trump's Michael Cohen says even Kim Jong-un thinks this is a bit much here play this clip [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=344.86s)]
*  President Trump is as we know the best dealmaker in the world everything he does is with a goal in mind [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  He is also a very pragmatic man because that's the only way you get deals done [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=360.06s)]
*  He is focused on one thing and one thing only making America safe and strong and prosperous [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=364.73999999999995s)]
*  And so every action he takes will lead us into that direction and moves us forward [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=370.65999999999997s)]
*  So the fact is China is engaging China did effectively they're not being silent [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=375.85999999999996s)]
*  They've had their own approach [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=381.78000000000003s)]
*  But the president's making it clear that he is going to and has from the start with the tariffs issue that this was a [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=383.3s)]
*  negotiation framework and our [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=390.66s)]
*  Evening the playing field with tariffs has brought virtually everyone to the table as we know and in this case [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=393.1s)]
*  Of course it appears including China. So President Trump will make decisions that are best for this country [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=400.02s)]
*  We've seen that and whether it's it is tariffs or in fact the situation with Ukraine where he remains committed to ending the carnage [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0lkmj1EiY&t=405.5s)]
