# WHOA! Trump Gets DESTROYED as Town Hall ERUPTS IN BOOS
**MeidasTouch:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs)
*  You've got MAGA Republican Congress members getting booed at town halls in Iowa now by [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=0.0s)]
*  their constituents in Ruby Red, Iowa. Watch MAGA Republican Congresswoman Hinson get booed [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  yesterday at her town hall. Play this clip. I was also proud to vote for President Trump's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=14.64s)]
*  one big beautiful bill last week. This is a generational investment. This is a general investment. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  This is your time. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=26.8s)]
*  Just the level of arrogance there as well by her. I want to bring in Kyle Kalinsky from Secular Talk. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=33.92s)]
*  We got to break this down together, Kyle, but I think there's some other data points we should [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=40.16s)]
*  look at as well. Let's not forget that on January 28th, 2025, a Democrat flipped a state Senate seat [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=45.28s)]
*  there that was a plus 21 Trump district there. The latest polls have the Democratic Senate [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=53.84s)]
*  candidate Nathan Sage leading Joni Ernst right there. And if you just listen, this is what I [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=61.6s)]
*  always tell people why I love your show, because you listen to your audience. Listen to what the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=68.64s)]
*  people are calling for in Iowa. They're asking these MAGA Republican Congress members about [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=75.04s)]
*  impeachment because of Donald Trump repeatedly violating the law. Let's watch this, then you and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=81.6s)]
*  I will chat about it. President Trump and his cabinet, in addition to being totally unqualified [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=86.64s)]
*  and inept, are breaking laws by ignoring federal judges' orders. The checks and balances of our [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  government includes Congress's responsibility to hold the executive branch accountable. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=105.04s)]
*  My question for you is when are you going to do the responsibility that you were elected for [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  by holding the executive branch accountable up to and including impeachment? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, let me start off by saying that judges need to follow the law. And I don't think this country [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=129.84s)]
*  needs another impeachment charade. That's what we saw in the last Congress, and I voted no on that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=138.32s)]
*  for a reason. Judges need to follow the law as well. And what I think is important about the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  bill we just passed is we have a number of judges who have been activist judges and going beyond the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=148.4s)]
*  scope of their district courts. And if you look at the laws that are on the books and Congress's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=153.92s)]
*  role there, judges need to be following federal civil procedure. So our bill includes a provision [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=160.0s)]
*  that would make sure that they follow things like rule number 65, which is what we've seen [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=165.92s)]
*  egregious abuses of by some of these judges recently. We have a bill called the Rogue [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=170.64s)]
*  Rulings Act, which would help to, again, reel this in. If someone is suing in a district court, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=175.44s)]
*  they should be provided relief in that district court. It's not a nationwide court decision. It [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=181.76s)]
*  is a district court decision, and that is designed on purpose within our system. And so judges need [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=186.32s)]
*  to be following that law as well. As far as the checks and balances, Congress is executing [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  its right to do that. We are using what's called the Congressional Review Act authority. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  We've used that in many cases. Already this Congress, when we don't like a rule or regulation [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  introduced by the administration, Congress can use the CRA to do that. These votes, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  many of them have been bipartisan, and we have done that several times on rules that I think take [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=211.52s)]
*  our country in the wrong direction. Many of them are from the previous administration, but I don't [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=216.72s)]
*  care who's president. I'm willing to work with anyone to, again, make sure that we're respecting [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  American citizens again. And 77 million Americans voted to make sure we are advancing these [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=225.44s)]
*  priorities. So thank you again for coming. We are out of time because I've got to get going to another [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=230.8s)]
*  stop in the district. We're out of time, Kyle. Kyle, we're out of time. Her response was to attack [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=235.28s)]
*  the judges in response to that question. What do you make of everything I just showed, Kyle? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=241.36s)]
*  Geez, where do I begin? So first of all, to that bill, it's just over $800 billion in Medicaid cuts, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=245.52s)]
*  which would absolutely destroy this country. That's health care for low income people, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=254.08s)]
*  for disabled people. It's ripping that away from them. That would be an absolute catastrophe [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=258.08s)]
*  if it actually gets through. That bill is also massive tax cuts for the wealthy, blows up the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=262.96s)]
*  debt and the deficit while they functionally raise taxes on working people in that bill. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=268.4s)]
*  So any defense of it whatsoever at this point just strikes me as flat out evil. Now to that guy's [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=273.84s)]
*  point about impeachment, the real question at this point is, which thing do we impeach him over? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  Because we have so many things to impeach him over, it's going to be hard to pick just one [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=286.56s)]
*  thing to focus on. But if I had to pick just one thing, I would have to go with the emoluments [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=291.28s)]
*  clause. The corruption is just through the roof. It's out of this world. I've never seen anything [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  like it. Saying he's going to take a $400 million jet from Qatar. Could you imagine if Joe Biden did [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  that or Barack Obama did that, what the reaction on the right would be? In his first term, he took [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  $160 million from foreign countries while he was president. The fact that the impeachment conversation [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=311.2s)]
*  is not top of mind for everybody right now is just an abysmal failure. We got to get rid of this guy. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=318.4s)]
*  We got to impeach him. He's got to be arrested. He's got to be charged criminally. This is untenable. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, Kyle, you know, the Beltway class, they're too busy talking about who's going to be the next [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=327.52s)]
*  left's Joe Rogan. They're saying, is it going to be Ben? Is it going to be Kyle? And we're out there [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=334.88s)]
*  saying, we don't want to be that. Please just listen to what the people are saying in the town [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=340.96s)]
*  halls. The people are suffering right now. Speak to those issues. And that's what you do so bravely, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  courageously at Secular Talk, your YouTube channel. So talk to us just about that, Kyle, which is [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  the biggest issues that are facing the American people are often the ones that the media is not [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=363.44s)]
*  talking about. All you have to do is show the clips that we just showed you. And you don't have to be [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=372.08s)]
*  a political savant to say, you got to help these people. They want you to fight for them, huh? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=378.0s)]
*  Yeah. People want universal health care. They want higher wages. They want to raise taxes on the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=385.52s)]
*  wealthy. They want a strong social safety net. They want to end all of Trump's insane [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=390.4s)]
*  warmongering and his threats with other countries and his trade war. To your point, you don't need [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=395.28s)]
*  a left's Joe Rogan. If anything, we should have an anti-Joe Rogan on the left. We don't need to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=400.96s)]
*  trick people into supporting us. Just fight for the things that would actually improve people's [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  lives. And then if you build it, they will come. And in this moment, there's a real opportunity [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  bubbling there where you just need some leaders to step up, speak to the voice of the people. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=417.12s)]
*  As you said, your AOCs, your Bernie Sanders, your Jasmine Crockett, your Tim Walz. There are a lot [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=422.08s)]
*  of people who are stepping up now and who are surprising me in a positive way. I mean, you had [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=427.6s)]
*  Tim Walz calling ICE the Gestapo the other day. He said, this is Trump's Gestapo. He said, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=431.2s)]
*  that's language that you wouldn't have heard previously, but it's about time that the Democrats [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=436.88s)]
*  took off the gloves and started telling the truth. Just tell the truth. And that's all we have to do. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=441.6s)]
*  It's such a bizarre thing when you cover it, I cover it. I mean, when you watch Trump's speech [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=447.6s)]
*  at West Point and you see him talking about trophy wives and how he doesn't like stealth and [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=454.64s)]
*  I mean, just anything he says in a given day, when you see the press conferences that he holds in [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=463.04s)]
*  the Oval Office where he berates a reporter because she asks him a question about him being [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=469.6s)]
*  called a taco that he always chickens out. The fact that it's YouTube channels like yours and ours [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=476.8s)]
*  and others in this zeitgeist that are the ones calling it out while corporate news is not, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  it just always shocked me because I'm like, don't you see it? Yeah, when Governor Walz calls him the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=493.04s)]
*  Gestapo, it's because these people are literally waiting in front of courts while people are showing [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=498.08000000000004s)]
*  up to their immigration hearings and they're freaking disappearing them and they're sending [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=505.04s)]
*  them to concentration camps in El Salvador, in South Sudan, in Libya. And we're supposed to be [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=509.28000000000003s)]
*  like cool with that. It's wild. Democrats need to listen to your show, talk about the things you're [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=516.08s)]
*  talking about, listen to my show, talk about the things I'm talking about because all we're doing [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=523.28s)]
*  is explaining what's actually happening in the country. On day one, Trump signed an executive [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=527.76s)]
*  order which functionally raised drug prices. He signed an executive order which allowed his cabinet [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=531.52s)]
*  to be corrupt and take money from whoever they want to take money from. I'm not doing anything [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=537.52s)]
*  novel here. You're not doing anything novel here. You are literally looking at what's happening [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  and reacting in real time and pointing at it and saying, that's bad. Am I the crazy one? Did I take [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  the crazy pills? Look at what's happening here. Why isn't everybody talking about this? This is [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  incredible. We're watching the destruction of our country right in front of our eyes and you're [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=555.04s)]
*  talking about finding a Joe Rogan of the left. Just talk about what he's actually doing and [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=559.2s)]
*  hammer him over it and build a positive agenda to counter the MAGA agenda. And then we win easy. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=563.2s)]
*  Kyle, there's a lot of intersection in our channels. When we mention you on our channel, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=570.08s)]
*  people will comment. When you mention us on the channel, people will comment. But [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=576.96s)]
*  for some of our subscribers who this may be the first time being introduced to you, although I [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=581.36s)]
*  would think that that's in the lesser group of people here. Just tell people about your channel, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=587.28s)]
*  what you started and going forward, what your overall goals are at Secular Talk. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=592.8s)]
*  I'm just a guy with a political science degree who took this up as a hobby in 2008, just giving [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=598.72s)]
*  my opinion on politics. Then in 2012, I started doing it full time, never looked back since. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=604.3199999999999s)]
*  And what I do is very similar to what you guys do. I talk about the news, I talk about politics, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=609.8399999999999s)]
*  I give my opinion. I'm trying desperately to drag this country back to sanity. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=615.04s)]
*  I'm focusing a lot these days on ending Trump's corruption, ending his warmongering, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z903CjV_cs&t=621.28s)]
