# WHOA! Michigan REPUDIATES Trump in SHOCK POLL
**MeidasTouch:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4)
*  Donald Trump is getting a rude awakening in Michigan after going to Michigan to, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=0.0s)]
*  no, no, celebrate 100 days, the most disastrous days ever in the first 100 [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=5.9s)]
*  days of a presidency. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  We're getting new polling data out of Michigan and Donald Trump's poll numbers. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=12.56s)]
*  There are crashing a recent poll at a Michigan is showing 56% of Michigan [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=16.38s)]
*  voters disapprove of Trump's performance after his first 100 days of his second [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=23.06s)]
*  term. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=29.64s)]
*  Only 17% say it's pretty good. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=30.48s)]
*  Only 24% of people say that it is excellent, but by far more people are [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=33.4s)]
*  viewing this as negative to catastrophic. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  Also, when you dig into the numbers here, Donald Trump is negative on every single [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=42.36s)]
*  issue. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=48.96s)]
*  The only issue though, where he, I guess, is, you know, basically at a baseline [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  and even is, I suppose, his main issue, immigration, for which 48% of respondents [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=54.36s)]
*  in Michigan gave him a positive rating and 48% gave him a negative rating, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=60.56s)]
*  with still 4% undecided. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=66.2s)]
*  And the pollster here says that it's clear from the data that he's beginning to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=69.6s)]
*  suffer from his own base, from the own MAGA supporters, which is interesting [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=75.36s)]
*  because he's usually able to still hold that kind of MAGA crew. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=80.16s)]
*  Of course, Michigan is a pivotal swing state, and unfortunately it went for Trump [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=83.2s)]
*  in the 2024 election. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=87.36s)]
*  Let me just show you the scene outside of that Trump rally or whatever the heck you [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=89.2s)]
*  want to call it, where he was there for his 100 days. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=93.84s)]
*  It seemed like there were more protesters and more than even people who were actually [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  at this event. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  Here was the scene outside of the event. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=102.76s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=104.28s)]
*  You know, one of the things too in Michigan that I've noticed also is that that Trumpism, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=113.2s)]
*  that just kind of cruelty and meanness, unfortunately, seeps into that Republican [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=135.24s)]
*  party there. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=140.4s)]
*  Their speaker of the House, a guy named Matt Hall, just the insults that he uses, I mean, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=141.08s)]
*  the way he refers to another state representative, Mai Zung. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=146.44s)]
*  And I'll just play it for you because they just use the Trump immature bullying. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=150.36s)]
*  And this should be nowhere, not in Michigan. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=155.6s)]
*  We should just act like adults and be professional and carry ourselves with dignity and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=158.28s)]
*  act responsibly. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=163.12s)]
*  But just watch, this is Michigan's Republican speaker of the House. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=163.96s)]
*  They all do like Trump routines now. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=166.76s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  You know, I think everybody saw yesterday and we have this very low IQ representative [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=169.56s)]
*  named Mai Zung, probably one of the dumbest ones in the legislature. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=175.88000000000002s)]
*  And I saw this video of her and she's like, the House speaker is not here today. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  We need to have session. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=186.08s)]
*  There's, you know, we need to work for the people of Michigan, Macomb County. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=188.08s)]
*  Well, where was I? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=192.96s)]
*  Let's bring in Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to talk about this all. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=194.6s)]
*  You're out with a new book, also, The Purposeful Warrior, standing up for what's right [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=199.4s)]
*  when the stakes are high. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=204.04s)]
*  You're also a candidate for governor in the state of Michigan. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=206.04s)]
*  So you're a pretty, pretty busy person right now. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=209.2s)]
*  Let's first talk about Donald Trump's poll numbers there, but less about the poll [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=211.6s)]
*  numbers. What are you seeing? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=216.24s)]
*  You know the state better than just about anybody. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=217.4s)]
*  What are you seeing, Secretary? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=219.72s)]
*  And where I go in Michigan, it's clear that these reckless tariffs and the confusing [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=221.32s)]
*  economic policies of this administration have only driven up the cost of living in the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  state and made things more uncertain for so many people. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=232.12s)]
*  I was in Saginaw speaking with some local merchants, small business owners, and they [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=235.68s)]
*  said, look, I don't know where our shipment's coming from. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=239.88s)]
*  If we're going to get any more inventory, if I can afford to make payroll, we may need [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=243.0s)]
*  to shut down. Stories like that are affecting people all across their state. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  Our farmers are wondering how they're going to ensure that they can meet their financial [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=250.84s)]
*  goals for the year. And then, of course, we have a, you know, that's not even touching [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=257.56s)]
*  the confusion and concerns around Medicaid that 2.5 million Michigan citizens rely on. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=261.04s)]
*  So it's a consistent feeling of anxiety, of confusion, of even among folks who supported [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=266.96s)]
*  President Trump because he told them that he would lower the cost of living. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=277.08000000000004s)]
*  And now they're only seeing costs go up. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=281.68s)]
*  So it's a lot of frustration, anger, fear and nervousness that I think and I believe [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=284.48s)]
*  the next governor can work to alleviate through policies that can address the economic [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  well-being of our people. But at the same time, undoubtedly, these poll numbers don't [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  surprise me because people are feeling the pain and the struggles that people have been [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=300.72s)]
*  going through in Michigan for a number of years have only exacerbated under this [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=304.28s)]
*  administration. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=308.08s)]
*  You know, then he shows up in Michigan. He gives that speech in Warren. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=309.08s)]
*  He praises the January 6th insurrectionists again. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=312.11999999999995s)]
*  He then talks about one of his accomplishments. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  He talks about, we've opened up toilet bowls. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=319.84s)]
*  I'm the toilet bowl president. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=322.79999999999995s)]
*  I'll just show it to you because every time I see it, I'm just like, wow. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=324.67999999999995s)]
*  I'm like, come on. Like, this is just not normal stuff. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=328.08s)]
*  Like, wake up people here. Just watch this. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=330.32s)]
*  I don't need to be under a shower trying to get water to come out of that damn thing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=334.28s)]
*  So we've opened up the shower heads, the faucets, the toilets, the washing machines [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=339.76s)]
*  that don't give you water. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=347.88s)]
*  All of that stuff has been opened up and we're giving. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=349.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, when people are feeling pain and we know the people in Michigan are feeling [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=353.88s)]
*  lots of pain, then he goes in and does that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=359.88s)]
*  I just go. This goes with your book. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=363.0s)]
*  I just go, that's not right. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=366.52s)]
*  Let's not talk about politics. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  I just go, that's not right. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  Like, don't we have to go back fundamentally to right? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=372.64s)]
*  Wrong. Purpose? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=377.55999999999995s)]
*  Non-purpose. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=379.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And bullies don't get to define who we are. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=381.08s)]
*  Right. No matter all the rhetoric, all the challenges, all the the noise, the chaos, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=383.23999999999995s)]
*  the cruelty, that does not have to define who we are. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=388.88s)]
*  And we have a choice as citizens every day to wake up and say, that's not me. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=392.72s)]
*  I will show myself, my community, our leaders what leadership really looks like. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=397.32s)]
*  And I think we've we don't hear enough people, frankly, these days saying that's not right. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=403.64s)]
*  Republicans, Democrats and everyone in between should be screaming this from the rooftop. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=409.36s)]
*  So much of what we're seeing now from the bullying that you just showed from Matt Hall, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=415.68s)]
*  which was atrocious and unacceptable from any public official and to all of the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=419.4s)]
*  confusing things that come out of the president's mouth. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  That's not right. And essentially, that's what I did in 2020 and beyond. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=430.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. I stood up and I said, you can't take the votes of our citizens away. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=434.59999999999997s)]
*  You can't challenge our fair, accurate election results. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=437.96s)]
*  That's not right. And some of my book is about how bullies punch back. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=440.84s)]
*  Like there are consequences to standing up for what's right when the when the stakes are high. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=445.32s)]
*  But at the same time, that does not mean that we sit down. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=451.16s)]
*  It means that we build a plan strategically to prepare for that punch when it comes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  But that should not deter us from standing up for what's right. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=459.88s)]
*  How big of an issue is Donald Trump's insulting of Canada on the economy of Michigan? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=463.92s)]
*  And how big of an impact are you seeing there? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=469.88s)]
*  I mean, it's not just the tariffs. Right. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=472.52s)]
*  When Donald Trump uses language of annexation, you know, all of our Canadian [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=474.56s)]
*  supporters who call themselves the the maple Midas, they go, Ben, that's war language. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=479.4s)]
*  He's speaking the way Vladimir Putin speaks to Ukraine, which leads to invasion. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=484.36s)]
*  So we don't take it as funny. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  We don't take it as a joke. And we're not traveling to these states anymore. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=492.64s)]
*  And, you know, I've seen people in Michigan, you know, go out and protest against Trump, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=497.08s)]
*  showing Canadian flags to show solidarity. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=502.48s)]
*  And then I saw the other one in Windsor and people. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=505.72s)]
*  So it was great to see that at its core, Americans recognize what important allies [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  Canadians are. But what do you see there? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=512.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the economic impact of this rhetoric, of this this fist pumping, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=514.28s)]
*  you know, chest pumping noise that is that is coming out of the White House. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=519.88s)]
*  The economic impact of that in Michigan is real because we are a state with several [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=525.72s)]
*  border crossings into Canada. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=530.64s)]
*  It affects our auto industry. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  It affects our health care industry. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=535.04s)]
*  It affects our energy and our ability to ensure that electricity is getting where it [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=537.88s)]
*  needs to be. Our partnership as a state with Canada, a neighboring country to the north [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=542.28s)]
*  that we have that that can can give us many ideas that we can actually learn from to [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=547.48s)]
*  improve the economic well-being and health care of our residents. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=553.3199999999999s)]
*  Instead of looking to our friend to the north and finding ways to work together so that [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=557.36s)]
*  we can all thrive, we are now having to deal with this rhetoric that is taking us in the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=562.72s)]
*  opposite direction. I think the states bordering Canada in the Midwest, like Michigan, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=568.24s)]
*  like Pennsylvania, like Wisconsin, like Minnesota, the governors of those states can work [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=573.6s)]
*  together. And this is something that I would work on as well as governor of Michigan to try to [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=578.84s)]
*  rebalance this rhetoric and rebuild that relationship because it does impact all of our [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=583.8000000000001s)]
*  states directly. But in this moment, the economic impact and challenges of this trade war [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=589.4s)]
*  are being felt in the pocketbooks of every resident of the state. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=595.8000000000001s)]
*  And before we go, talk about the book, The Purposeful Warrior. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, we talked about it a little bit before there, but the idea of being purposeful, the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=603.32s)]
*  idea of right and wrong, as you said, the decisions that you had to make in 2020 of [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=608.24s)]
*  this isn't even about this political party or that party. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=614.16s)]
*  You don't steal elections. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=617.2s)]
*  You don't try to overthrow free and fair elections. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=620.2s)]
*  You know, and what's really, you know, impacted me so much, you know, as I am seeing, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=623.36s)]
*  though, even Trump appoint to judges who are ruling against him on certain issues about, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=630.4s)]
*  you know, due process. But then I see Donald Trump inviting the head of the Proud Boys to Mar-a-Lago [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=635.72s)]
*  this past weekend. They were partying together. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=642.24s)]
*  Enrique Tarrio, Donald Trump partying at Mar-a-Lago together. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=644.36s)]
*  And then I think of the Trump appointed judge who sentenced Enrique Tarrio to 22 years. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=648.96s)]
*  And, you know, and speak to that if you can. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=654.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a really harrowing moment for our country. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=657.72s)]
*  And what the book is really about, it started by my effort to talk about what it was like to [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=661.88s)]
*  stand up to the president and his supporters in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=666.9200000000001s)]
*  There were consequences. It was not easy, but it was the right thing to do because at the end of [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=672.6s)]
*  the day, we are a democracy and we stand by the will of the voters no matter who wins. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=677.0s)]
*  And at the same time now, as we see these economic policies wreaking havoc on our state and [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=680.9200000000001s)]
*  elsewhere, I believe and I'm reminded by that quote, I think President Clinton said, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=685.28s)]
*  there is nothing that's wrong with this country that cannot be solved by what's right about this [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=690.16s)]
*  country. And what's best about this country is our people are the American citizens. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=693.8s)]
*  So this book is a call to action for all of us to be warriors for ourselves, for the truth, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=698.52s)]
*  for the rule of law, for our constitution, for our communities, for our loved ones, for our [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=703.12s)]
*  economy. And history teaches us if we all collectively work as warriors, showing grace, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=708.0s)]
*  empathy, strategy, focus, it's not just about fighting, it's doing it in a way that gets things [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=713.72s)]
*  done and moves the needle and wins elections and the like. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=719.24s)]
*  If we do that, we can get through this moment and emerge with a healthier and stronger country than [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=722.4s)]
*  ever before. That's what I'm fighting for. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=726.52s)]
*  And at the end of my book, not to give anything away, what I define is is that vision and say, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=729.2s)]
*  you know, this is what we can build together. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibgF1GncM4&t=734.72s)]
