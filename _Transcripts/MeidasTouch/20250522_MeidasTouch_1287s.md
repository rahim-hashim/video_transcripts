# Republicans RIPPED TO SHREDS as DISASTER BILL PASSES
**MeidasTouch:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g)
*  It's not just Democrats, it's the entire country ripping these MAGA Republicans to shreds for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=0.0s)]
*  passing this horrific budget in the middle of the night when through the morning these proceedings [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=8.16s)]
*  it's going to add trillions to the deficit, cut Medicaid, cut Medicare, take away supplemental [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=14.88s)]
*  nutrition assistance programs. It's going to take away rental assistance programs. It's going to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=21.44s)]
*  give trillions of tax cuts for the billionaires, but also don't worry there will be tax exemptions [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=26.8s)]
*  for silencers and no more regulations in order to register your silencer. That was a major initiative [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=33.84s)]
*  that the MAGA Republicans pushed in this and also to rename certain types of savings accounts [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=42.88s)]
*  as Trump accounts. Horrific stuff and the stock market and the bond markets are not reacting [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  favorably to this horrific bill that just passed in the House. It still needs to pass in the Senate [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=56.4s)]
*  so we'll see what happens there, but here you have MAGA Republican Speaker of the House, MAGA Mike Johnson [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=62.8s)]
*  praising his dear leader in terms that we would normally see in Kim Jong-un's North Korea. Play this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=70.24s)]
*  clip. On the world stage, today wouldn't be possible without the leadership of arguably the most [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=76.32s)]
*  powerful and the most successful and the most respected president in the modern era of United States. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=83.84s)]
*  Our Democrat colleagues mocked the objective truth. We were delivered unified government, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=99.44s)]
*  my friends, in November. The White House, the Senate, and the House were delivered to the party [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=105.44s)]
*  on this side of the aisle so you can laugh all you want, all right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=110.24s)]
*  And spoken like a true huckster, MAGA Republican Congressmember Bean, let's play this clip. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=116.0s)]
*  So buckle up America and put your seat in the upright position because with the passage of this [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  bill the golden age of America is ready for takeoff. The MAGA Republicans were also bragging earlier [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  this morning that they are removing the free method that exists to file your taxes in order [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=138.16s)]
*  to help the businesses that want to control that market. That was a big initiative for them to get [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=145.84s)]
*  rid of the IRS free direct file system. Play this clip. Regardless of zip code. In addition, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=151.28s)]
*  we are bringing an end to the unauthorized, wasteful, and redundant IRS direct file program [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=158.56s)]
*  which directly contradicts taxpayers' best interest. This moment is years in the making [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=163.92s)]
*  and we now have the opportunity to deliver on the job Americans elected us to do in a fiscally [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=170.0s)]
*  responsible way. I strongly- And here's MAGA Republican Congressmember Clyde on his initiative [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=176.16s)]
*  to remove regulations on silencers for guns, silencers that have regulations that have been [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  around for like a hundred years. Here play this clip. Thank you Mr. Chairman. My Democrat colleagues [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=191.76s)]
*  have challenged why the deregulation of silencers is in this bill and why are we removing the $200 [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=197.12s)]
*  tax. Well under the law they are firearms and therefore protected by another law enacted in 1791 [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=202.48s)]
*  called our second amendment of our beloved constitution. The right of the people to keep [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=208.64s)]
*  and bear arms shall not be infringed and neither shall it be taxed. Chief Justice John Marshall in [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  1819 declared that the power to tax includes the power to destroy. If you can tax it then you can [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=218.8s)]
*  destroy it. You can raise the tax so high that almost no one can afford it and then you really [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=224.24s)]
*  don't have a right at all. But the second amendment is an unalienable constitutional right, God given [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=229.36s)]
*  that governments are required to protect not to tax. The Supreme Court in the Heller decision of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=235.04s)]
*  2008 declared the second amendment to be an individual constitutional right, further protecting [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=240.32s)]
*  it from taxation just like the right to speak and the right to vote. This bill simply restores [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=245.92s)]
*  that right from over 90 years of draconian tax. My Democrat colleagues have asked how did this get [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=250.72s)]
*  in the bill? What was the deal and who asked for it? No deal. I believe the speaker with the purest [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=255.6s)]
*  of motives simply wanted to restore a constitutional right. And who asked? Me I asked. I yield. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=260.47999999999996s)]
*  Perhaps it's because it's now past 4 a.m. but I feel like I've entered the twilight zone. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  We have 13.7 million Americans at least who are going to lose their health insurance because of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=274.88s)]
*  this bill. Another 500 billion dollars worth of cuts to Medicare on top of that. And what is one [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=281.52s)]
*  of their last speakers talking about? A tax cut if you buy silencers. This is bizarre. The reality is [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=288.88s)]
*  millions and millions of Americans are going to lose their health coverage all to help subsidize [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=299.2s)]
*  tax cuts for billionaires. Oh yes and also tax cuts for those who buy gun silencers. And with [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=305.76s)]
*  Here are the Republicans celebrating on the floor of the house. On this vote the yeas are 215 the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=312.0s)]
*  Nasir 214 with one answering present. The bill is passed. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=318.08s)]
*  Oh [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=348.08s)]
*  Maga Republican Congress member Smith saying we didn't pass this in the middle of the night. Look [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=361.28s)]
*  we did it this morning even though you literally put this thing forward at 1 a.m. two days ago [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=367.84s)]
*  and then you were pushing all of this through like literally at 1 a.m. again [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=374.72s)]
*  this morning. But here's congress member Smith play this clip. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Speaker. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=379.04s)]
*  The the Democrat leader is mistaken. We aren't currently in the dead of night. We are voting [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=383.92s)]
*  for the one big beautiful bill. House to be in order. We are voting for the one big beautiful bill [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=391.6s)]
*  first thing in the morning because the relief for working families simply can't wait and will work [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=402.32s)]
*  until the job's done and we're going to. Now let's talk about the Democrats right here what [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=408.88s)]
*  they were doing. Leader Jeffries I thought gave a very impassioned speech. Let's play this clip. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=412.8s)]
*  In this you are to direct your comments to the chair. Mr. Speaker you know what's interesting [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=419.28s)]
*  is that every time I've come on this floor I can use sharp language. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=427.52s)]
*  He can use sharp language. You choose to admonish me. I don't work for you sir. I work for the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=431.92s)]
*  American. I understand. I understand. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=438.0s)]
*  House will be in order. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=457.44s)]
*  As I said Mr. Leader we've been very patient. Just listen to the majority leader of the other [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=466.8s)]
*  side who directed all of his comments to the chair. It is important for the decorum of the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=473.76s)]
*  institution for you to do the same. We can continue this. You may proceed. Every time [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=480.32s)]
*  I'm interrupted that's going to add another 15 minutes to my remarks. Mr. Speaker. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=488.48s)]
*  Here's leader Jeffries again. And that's what this one big ugly bill represents. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=499.12s)]
*  Not simply a broken promise as it relates to your failures on the economy. And despite [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=507.04s)]
*  the gentleman from Louisiana trying to articulate all of the so-called successes that have taken [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=515.12s)]
*  place we know that this presidency has already been a failure filled with crisis and chaos [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=521.76s)]
*  cruelty and corruption. And the American people know it which is why Donald Trump [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=533.6s)]
*  at the 100 day mark was the most unpopular president in American history. The American [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=540.48s)]
*  people understand. It's unfolding right before the eyes no matter what kind of maga spin [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=547.52s)]
*  you try to put on the situation and things are going to get worse. Why? Because of this big [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=556.24s)]
*  ugly bill. Not simply an assault on the economy a broken promise. It's an assault [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=565.6s)]
*  on the health care of the American people. You see as Democrats we believe in this country [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=574.72s)]
*  health care is not simply a privilege. Health care is a right. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=581.36s)]
*  And from Medicare to Medicaid to the passage of the Affordable Care Act and subsequently [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=591.76s)]
*  enhancing it we've begun to move America to a place where every single person in this land [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=598.48s)]
*  could have access to the health care that they need to live a life of dignity and respect. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=606.9599999999999s)]
*  At this moment in America we have the lowest rate of uninsured people in our nation's history. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=613.4399999999999s)]
*  But this GOP tax scam will reverse that with this assault on health care. The largest [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=621.04s)]
*  cut to Medicaid in American history and here's what it will mean for the American people. Children [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=629.2800000000001s)]
*  will get hurt. Women will get hurt. Older Americans who rely on Medicaid for nursing home care [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=638.5600000000001s)]
*  and for home care will get hurt. People with disabilities who rely on Medicaid to survive [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=648.48s)]
*  will get hurt. Hospitals in your districts will close. Nursing homes will shut down and people [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=656.4799999999999s)]
*  will die. That's not hype. That's not hyperbole. That's not a hypothetical. The people that you [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=665.52s)]
*  all represent have been writing to us to make that clear. Thousands of people who've written to us [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=673.8399999999999s)]
*  who've written to us everyday Americans have made that clear. Do you know fast growing trees [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGryqZ7D2_g&t=683.44s)]
