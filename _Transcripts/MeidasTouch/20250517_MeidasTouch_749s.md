# Trump Has NIGHTMARE Wake Up as It All IMPLODES
**MeidasTouch:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU)
*  Wow, Trump's morning is off to an awful start. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=0.0s)]
*  Maybe one of his worst ever, and his failures are catching up to him fast. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=3.56s)]
*  Now Trump is in full meltdown mode, desperately trying to do damage control as the world around [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=8.36s)]
*  him crumbles. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=13.8s)]
*  My name is Brett Mycelis with the Midas Touch Network. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=15.32s)]
*  Remember to hit subscribe. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=17.2s)]
*  Let's get to 5 million subscribers. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=18.48s)]
*  Oh, and add the Midas Touch Podcast on Apple Podcasts and Spotify. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  So yesterday, Trump's lies met their match when reality struck back hard. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=23.96s)]
*  For the first time ever, Moody's downgraded the credit rating of the United States, citing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=29.8s)]
*  the deficit and debt that is about to explode to record highs under the Trump and GOP plan. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=34.5s)]
*  Since 1917, 1917, Moody's has given the United States the coveted triple A rating. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=40.68s)]
*  And now for the first time, the US has a double A1 rating. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=47.64s)]
*  Moody said the following, we do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=56.32s)]
*  In other words, the GOP tax scam is going to blow a hole through our deficit with its [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=61.84s)]
*  increased spending and tax cuts for the rich. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=67.0s)]
*  Moody says that it expects federal deficits to widen to almost 9% of GDP by 2035. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=69.84s)]
*  That's up from 6.4% in 2024. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=76.12s)]
*  Stock futures fell and treasury yields rose after the downgrade. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=79.48s)]
*  Let me just tell you the real world implications of all this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=83.28s)]
*  When the US loses its triple A status, it's not just symbolic. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=86.24s)]
*  Higher treasury yields means the government pays even more interest. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=90.32s)]
*  Interest rates go up everywhere. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=94.24s)]
*  That means mortgages, business loans, credit cards, and so on. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  All that gets more expensive. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=99.28s)]
*  Confidence of the US financial system is further eroded, which could lead to a weakened dollar [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=101.32s)]
*  and even higher inflation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=105.44s)]
*  This is a major warning sign, a major warning sign showing that things are heading in the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  wrong direction. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=111.96s)]
*  And you all know by now there is always a tweet and we always bring the receipts. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  So check this out from none other than Donald Trump in 2012 when Barack Obama was president. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=117.6s)]
*  Trump wrote, quote, you get what you vote for. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=123.32s)]
*  US credit rating is about to be downgraded once again. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  Well Trump voters, let me echo Donald Trump here for a second. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  When I say you are getting what you voted for and we are all paying the price and get [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=132.92s)]
*  ready because in a few moments I want to show you Trump's complete and utter meltdown [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=138.72s)]
*  over a brutal loss he was hit with by the Supreme Court. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=142.76s)]
*  But first, that so-called big beautiful tax bill I mentioned. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=146.4s)]
*  That's what Trump likes to call it anyway. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=150.16s)]
*  Well as of now, it is a big beautiful bust. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=151.96s)]
*  The Republican Party rebuked Donald Trump's demand yesterday for Republicans to unite [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=155.68s)]
*  and push the bill through and instead the party plunged into chaos. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  Trump had posted the following, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=164.44s)]
*  Republicans must unite behind the one big beautiful bill. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=166.2s)]
*  Not only does it cut taxes for all Americans, but it will kick millions of illegal aliens [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=169.96s)]
*  off of Medicaid to protect it for those who are the ones in real need. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=174.72s)]
*  I'll pause there just to say that is a complete and total lie. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=178.56s)]
*  That is not happening and this bill is going to strip away Medicaid from Americans who [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=181.96s)]
*  actually rely upon it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=186.2s)]
*  Trump continued, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=188.28s)]
*  The country will suffer greatly without this legislation with their taxes going up 65% [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=189.28s)]
*  blah blah blah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=194.04s)]
*  I'm not going to read the rest of his propaganda, but I just want to show you how Republicans [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=195.44s)]
*  ignored him completely. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=198.48s)]
*  The bill was blocked in the House Budget Committee with five Republicans voting against it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=200.28s)]
*  That should have been the easiest of the votes by far. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=204.6s)]
*  Now don't think the Republicans all of a sudden had a change of heart, suddenly got nice. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=207.64s)]
*  Some of them think that the bill actually needs to cut Medicaid even more, while some [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=212.0s)]
*  are afraid of what the cuts could mean for their reelection chances. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  Some are upset about the cap on the salt deductions. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=219.36s)]
*  You basically have all these warring factions within the GOP and it looks like that's going [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=221.36s)]
*  to get even messier and more complicated when it hits the Senate. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=225.0s)]
*  The House Budget Committee, meanwhile, is scheduled to reconvene on Sunday night at [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=228.72s)]
*  10 p.m. eastern to give this vote another shot. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=232.4s)]
*  And as Trump was blowing up our economy, what was he worried about? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=235.4s)]
*  Well Trump was posting that because of him, Taylor Swift is no longer hot. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=238.8s)]
*  You heard that right. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=244.08s)]
*  Trump wrote the following, has anyone else noticed that since I said I hate Taylor Swift, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=245.18s)]
*  she's no longer hot? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=250.86s)]
*  I mean, she just finished the most successful tour in history, like literally in history. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=252.58s)]
*  It brought in billions and billions of dollars. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=257.62s)]
*  And then these MAGA influencers like Clockwork have to come out of the woodwork and Trump [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=259.46000000000004s)]
*  boost these people. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=263.5s)]
*  Losers like an account named Cat Turd, who's like an older guy who spends by his own admission, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=264.5s)]
*  by his own admission, 15 hours a day on X or Twitter, whatever people call it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=269.42s)]
*  They pile on and they say things like this, just so you know, she was never hot. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=274.06s)]
*  OK, Cat Turd. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=279.22s)]
*  Trump was also whining about and threatening Bruce Springsteen after the boss delivered [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=281.3s)]
*  powerful remarks against the Trump administration during his European tour. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=285.54s)]
*  Trump posted, I see that highly overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a foreign country [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=290.38s)]
*  to speak badly about the president of the United States. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=295.0s)]
*  Never liked him, never liked his music or his radical left politics. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=298.14s)]
*  And importantly, he's not a talented guy, just a pushy obnoxious jerk who fervently [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=301.86s)]
*  supported crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent fool and our worst president ever, who came [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=306.7s)]
*  close to destroying our country. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=312.18s)]
*  If I wasn't elected, it would have been gone by now. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=314.3s)]
*  Sleepy Joe didn't have a clue as to what he was doing, but Springsteen is dumb as a rock [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=316.98s)]
*  and couldn't see what was going on, or could he? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=321.14s)]
*  Which is even worse. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=323.26s)]
*  This dried out prune of a rocker, his skin is all atrophied, ought to keep his mouth [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=324.56s)]
*  shut until he gets back into the country. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=328.98s)]
*  That's just standard fare. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=331.46s)]
*  Then we will all see how it goes for him. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=333.06s)]
*  I don't know about you, that seems like a threat to me. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=335.09999999999997s)]
*  A threat from a whiny, petulant baby, but a threat nonetheless. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=337.26s)]
*  Because I know it bothers him so much, and because it's a powerful message, let me just [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=342.06s)]
*  show you Springsteen's remarks in England one more time. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=346.06s)]
*  It's powerful. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=348.62s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=349.62s)]
*  This is very weird, strange, and dangerous shit going on out there. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=350.62s)]
*  In America, they are persecuting people for using their right to free speech and voicing [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=362.62s)]
*  their dissent. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=370.62s)]
*  This is happening now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=374.62s)]
*  In America, the richest men are taking satisfaction and abandoning the world's poorest children [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=377.62s)]
*  to sickness and death. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=387.62s)]
*  This is happening now. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=394.62s)]
*  In my country, they're taking sadistic pleasure in the pain that they inflict on royal American [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=397.62s)]
*  workers. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=405.62s)]
*  They're rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=406.62s)]
*  society. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=414.62s)]
*  They're abandoning our great allies. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=415.62s)]
*  And siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=422.62s)]
*  What did I tell you? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=427.62s)]
*  Powerful. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=429.62s)]
*  Powerful stuff right there. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=430.62s)]
*  And if you thought Trump's meltdown over that was bad, I still got to show you his reaction [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=431.62s)]
*  to his brutal loss of the Supreme Court. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=434.62s)]
*  But first, let me talk about a story that's not getting nearly enough attention in my [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=436.62s)]
*  opinion, and this relates to Trump's budget proposal. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=439.62s)]
*  Viewers of Midas Touch know that climate issues are very important to us, so I want to make [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=442.62s)]
*  sure we're always highlighting important stories on the topic. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=446.62s)]
*  And right now, as we speak, House Republicans are calling for billions of dollars in funding [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=448.62s)]
*  cuts for Biden-era climate and environmental programs. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=454.62s)]
*  This includes, by the way, the Biden Clean Energy Tax credits. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=457.62s)]
*  Environmental groups are sounding the alarm. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=461.62s)]
*  They say that these proposals would pave the way for more oil and gas industry activity [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=464.62s)]
*  on public lands. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=468.62s)]
*  That would increase greenhouse gas emissions that cause the warming of the planet to increase. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=470.62s)]
*  Republican House committees are targeting these climate initiatives, which passed as [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=474.62s)]
*  part of the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=478.62s)]
*  These initiatives were passed to slow climate change and boost clean energy, such as wind [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=480.62s)]
*  and solar power. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=484.62s)]
*  We're going to keep you posted on all the developments related to these climate policies [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=486.62s)]
*  as Republicans continue to work on this bill, so check back in. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=489.62s)]
*  Okay, back to the Supreme Court. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=493.62s)]
*  The Supreme Court yesterday blocked Donald Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=495.62s)]
*  Venezuelans in a 7-2 ruling, with Alito and Thomas dissenting. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=499.62s)]
*  They sent the case back to the Fifth Circuit for a new decision. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=503.62s)]
*  Well, Trump did not take that news well, to say the least, and he made an all-caps post [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=506.62s)]
*  saying the following. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=511.62s)]
*  The Supreme Court won't allow us to get criminals out of our country. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=513.62s)]
*  As legal reporter and editor-in-chief of All Rise News Adam Klassfeld wrote, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=517.62s)]
*  Trump once again is lying here. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=521.62s)]
*  The Supreme Court majority wrote, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=524.62s)]
*  The government may remove the name plaintiffs or putative class members under other lawful [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=526.62s)]
*  authorities. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=531.62s)]
*  The due process, however, is not optional. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=532.62s)]
*  Then Trump made another post writing the following, and this is just so crazy. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=536.62s)]
*  The Supreme Court has just ruled that the worst murderers, drug dealers, gang members, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=540.62s)]
*  and even those who are mentally insane who came into our country illegally are not allowed [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=544.62s)]
*  to be forced out without going through a long, protracted, and expensive legal process, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=549.62s)]
*  one that will take possibly many years for each person, and one that will allow these [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=554.62s)]
*  people to commit many crimes before they even see the inside of a courthouse. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=558.62s)]
*  The result of this decision will let more criminals pour into our country, doing great [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=562.62s)]
*  harm to our cherished American public. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=566.62s)]
*  It will also encourage other criminals to illegally enter our country, wreaking havoc [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=569.62s)]
*  and bedlam wherever they go. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=573.62s)]
*  The Supreme Court of the United States is not allowing me to do what I was elected to do. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=575.62s)]
*  Sleepy Joe Biden allowed millions of criminal aliens to come into our country without any process. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=579.62s)]
*  But in order to get them out of the country, we have to go through a long and extended process. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=584.62s)]
*  In any event, thank you Justice Alito and Justice Thomas for attempting to protect our country. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=588.62s)]
*  This is a bad and dangerous day for America. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=594.62s)]
*  Okay, let me pitch you an idea. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=597.62s)]
*  Maybe you follow the law. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=599.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=601.62s)]
*  Maybe you don't make up that we're being invaded and are at war with Venezuela. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=602.62s)]
*  Maybe, like the Supreme Court said, you just give people due process or hire more judges. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=606.62s)]
*  You know, things like what the Democrats were trying to pass with that bipartisan bill, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=611.62s)]
*  that border bill that you torpedoed last year. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=616.62s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=618.62s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, I bet you haven't heard about this. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=619.62s)]
*  Ken Delaney is now reporting that the Trump administration has decided to permit the sale [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=622.62s)]
*  of devices that enable regular firearms to fire like machine guns. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=626.62s)]
*  A move that one person familiar with the matter said was by far the most dangerous thing this [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=631.62s)]
*  administration has done on gun policy. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=636.62s)]
*  Two people familiar with the matter told NBC News the Justice Department has signed a settlement [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=639.62s)]
*  in a lawsuit brought by the NRA, the National Association for Gun Rights, rather. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=644.62s)]
*  The lawsuit challenged an ATF rule banning forced reset triggers, devices that allow [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=648.62s)]
*  semi-automatic weapons to fire rapid bursts of bullets. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=653.62s)]
*  So all the stories we just went through, is this a stable person that we're dealing with? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=657.62s)]
*  I mean it. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=662.62s)]
*  I'm not being facetious here. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=663.62s)]
*  I mean it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=664.62s)]
*  Objectively asking. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=665.62s)]
*  Or is this a person actively destroying our country day by day? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=667.62s)]
*  And while some of the media want to focus on Joe Biden being old for some reason, we're [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=671.62s)]
*  laser focused on the issues that matter to you, to your family. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=677.62s)]
*  The disastrous GOP tax scam bill. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=681.62s)]
*  Our credit rating being downgraded. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=684.62s)]
*  The one-year inflation expectations soaring to 7.3%. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=686.62s)]
*  The climate crisis. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=691.62s)]
*  The destruction of due process, of our laws, of our entire legal system. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=693.62s)]
*  The corruption and bribery that is currently taking place. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=697.62s)]
*  The corporate media is all about these distractions. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=701.62s)]
*  But that's why independent media is more important than ever. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=704.62s)]
*  So thank you for staying focused, for understanding the moment that we are in. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7u87acNcSU&t=707.62s)]
