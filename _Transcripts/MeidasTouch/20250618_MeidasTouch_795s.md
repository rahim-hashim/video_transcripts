# ðŸš¨ SECRET Settlement by Trump EXPOSED in MAJOR LAWSUIT
**MeidasTouch:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k)
*  So with all of the chaos and disorder the Trump regime is causing here in the United States, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't want to get distracted from other things that the Trump regime is doing. You know, they're [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=5.44s)]
*  entering into these settlement agreements. You all know the same way Donald Trump basically tries to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=10.32s)]
*  use executive order as end run around Congress and like the lawmaking process. But one of the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=16.4s)]
*  other things that he's doing is he's basically having the agencies, a lot of which he's trying [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=23.92s)]
*  to gut and destroy. But the one function why he's kind of keeping some of these agencies on life [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=29.36s)]
*  support is he's having them enter into settlement agreements on behalf of the agency that basically [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=34.64s)]
*  undermines the entire agency's purpose. I'll tell you what I mean about that in a minute. Also, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=42.08s)]
*  he has like the DOJ entering into settlement agreements with January 6th insurrectionists. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=47.6s)]
*  You all know that the family of Ashley Babbitt received millions of dollars. That then invited a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=54.32s)]
*  hundred million dollar lawsuit by the leaders of the Proud Boys and they're all out there saying, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=62.24s)]
*  look, Trump's settling these cases with other insurrectionists. He's saying that we're political [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=69.12s)]
*  prisoners and hostages. Hey, judge, just take judicial notice. The president of the United [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=74.56s)]
*  States is saying that we're hostages. So clearly we should get $100 million. And even if the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=79.36s)]
*  hundred million dollar payment is not made to the leaders of the Proud Boys, and we'll see what ends [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=85.36s)]
*  up happening with that lawsuit, the taxpayers now have to deal with all of this. And this is as [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=90.0s)]
*  Trump's disastrous budget is sure to increase our debt by tens of trillions of dollars. I want to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=96.24s)]
*  talk about this other settlement that I think is not getting enough attention, but the attorney [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=104.08s)]
*  generals are making sure the democratic attorney generals are making sure that we focus on this, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=108.96s)]
*  because it's very important. So one of the things that the Trump regime is trying to do [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=114.48s)]
*  is distribute back into communities, into cities and towns, thousands of machine gun conversion [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=120.08s)]
*  devices across the country. So here's what happened under the Biden administration, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=127.68s)]
*  the alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives agency, the ATF entered into action, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=133.12s)]
*  administrative action, where it basically confiscated a lot of these forced reset trigger [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=142.4s)]
*  devices and basically said people can't use them. The Trump regime reversed that. They just entered [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=148.4s)]
*  into a settlement agreement where they said on behalf of the ATF, not only can these machine [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=154.32s)]
*  gun conversion devices be used once again, but to the extent the ATF has confiscated these devices, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=160.96s)]
*  send them right back into the communities, push them right back into the cities. And these are [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  turning these semi-automatic weapons into machine guns. And this is a major issue. You add that with [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=173.44s)]
*  the fact that the MAGA Republicans in Congress want to remove the regulations for silencers as [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=179.52s)]
*  part of their disastrous budget bill. And you just have to ask what the hell are they doing? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=186.56s)]
*  Let me just show you this clip. This is from, you can see how it's impacting Michigan, but we'll talk [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=190.96s)]
*  about how it's impacting all of the states. But here, play this clip. The attorney general is one [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=194.88s)]
*  of 16 AGs suing to block a federal settlement. And that would actually allow the sale of devices [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=198.72s)]
*  that can turn regular guns into machine guns. And that is what's getting so much attention. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=204.32s)]
*  Jay Scott Smith is live in Southfield with more on this controversial case. Jay. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=209.12s)]
*  Yes, indeed. Now this is actually seen as an about faced by the federal government. And the suit is [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=213.68s)]
*  meant to make sure that a dangerous weapon doesn't get scarier. The lawsuit was filed in federal court [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  in Maryland on Monday. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nestle was one of 15 state attorneys general, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=228.24s)]
*  along with the DC attorney general, to sign on to the suit. Now the states are suing to stop a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  settlement that would allow for the sale of forced reset triggers, which are illegal in the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=239.2s)]
*  state of Michigan. And they allow a semi-automatic weapon, typically an AR-15, to fire at a faster [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=243.6s)]
*  rate, effectively turning it into a machine gun. It causes the weapon to fire more rapidly. And [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=249.28s)]
*  a weapon that fires that rapidly, it allows you to hit multiple targets. The settlement was reached [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  on May 16th and would require the ATF to return the triggers that had been previously seized [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=263.36s)]
*  during the Biden administration or voluntarily surrendered to the government. And while this is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=268.4s)]
*  seen as a victory for second amendment advocates, this could be bad news for law enforcement [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  agencies across the country, including here in Southeast Michigan. Let's bring in Matt Plattkin, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=278.08s)]
*  New Jersey attorney general. You know, when I watch this attorney general Plattkin and I see [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=283.2s)]
*  just even what the weapon is capable of doing when it has this device and it's converted into a [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=288.4s)]
*  machine gun. And I think the Trump regime is entering into these settlement agreements to get [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=294.56s)]
*  these into cities. Look, I'm all for the second amendment. I'm all for people owning guns and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=299.76s)]
*  protecting their families. I look at that though, and I go, who wants that? What is going on? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=305.68s)]
*  Yeah, look, first, thanks for having me. And I think it's fair to say that this is a totally [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=312.4s)]
*  insane thing that the administration is doing, not through any form of legal process, not through a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=317.52s)]
*  rulemaking or a new law, but through a collusive settlement with a friendly party in the gun [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=323.44s)]
*  industry. And, you know, I've been involved in the gun violence prevention efforts and movement for [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=328.88s)]
*  over two decades now, and I never thought I'd have to sue the federal government to keep them from [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=334.08s)]
*  putting machine guns, machine guns into the hands of 12,000 people across the country at a time when [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=339.92s)]
*  what we're doing is saving lives. So all this talk about law and order, look, machine guns have been [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=347.44s)]
*  illegal in this country for decades. And the ATF has treated machine gun conversion devices like [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=352.24s)]
*  the devices we're talking about here that you just showed as machine guns for decades. And so this is [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=358.56s)]
*  an unprecedented, reckless and incredibly dangerous action that they're taking. I want to flag the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=364.24s)]
*  point you made there though, is that look, if Congress thinks this is so massively popular, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=369.36s)]
*  machine guns for everybody, walk down your schools, see, you know, people with machine [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=375.6s)]
*  guns in front, like if y'all want that and you think that's what your constituents want, okay, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=381.04s)]
*  go and pass legislation or go through the rulemaking process in an agency and make it [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=387.20000000000005s)]
*  public, explain what you're doing. But just like with the executive orders, what the Trump regime [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  is doing is they go, oh, here's how we get around it. We're in a lawsuit with the gun lobby. So let's [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=399.92s)]
*  just have a private mediation as though we're adversaries with the gun lobby. And then we'll [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=407.12s)]
*  enter into a settlement agreement. And a settlement agreement will now be the government's position [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=412.72s)]
*  because you sued us, oopsies, we lose, you win. And then they're delivering what they want, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=419.2s)]
*  what the gun lobby wants, but where there should have been legislation. Yeah. And I think what's [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=426.96s)]
*  crazy about, particularly crazy about this settlement is they won't even tell us who the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=432.48s)]
*  parties of the settlement are. They're going to give back these machine gun conversion devices. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=438.32s)]
*  And notwithstanding what anybody tries to tell you, that's what they turn firearms into, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=443.12s)]
*  something capable of firing 900 rounds a minute, the equivalent of even faster, frankly, than an [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=448.16s)]
*  M16 military grade machine gun. And so they're going to give back through this policy, these [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=452.96000000000004s)]
*  machine gun conversion devices to people across the country, as well as to sellers and resellers [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=458.8s)]
*  who would sell them into states like New Jersey, where machine guns are illegal. Even if Congress [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=464.0s)]
*  changed the law, New Jersey has a law banning machine guns because who needs a machine gun? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  It's consistent with the second amendment. Even the folks challenging the regulations around [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=474.56s)]
*  bump stocks. When they got up to the Supreme court, they said, no, no, no, FRTs, these machine gun [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=478.8s)]
*  conversion devices are different. We're not talking about those. We're talking about bump stocks. So [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=483.52s)]
*  even they recognize that these are something that the federal government can regulate. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=487.44s)]
*  And yet here we are at a time when supposedly we care about public safety and law and order. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=492.08s)]
*  We're putting machine guns, which have one purpose and one purpose only, which is to kill as many [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=497.12s)]
*  people as fast as possible into the hands of potentially violent individuals across this [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=501.92s)]
*  country. It's so, it's so interesting you said that because when I was preparing to do this [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=506.72s)]
*  interview, I was trying to read the articles and say, who are they settling with? Like who are the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=511.92s)]
*  signatories? And I couldn't find it. So I was wondering, you know, did I not do the research [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=519.44s)]
*  with? That's why even in my opening, I try to hedge around as a settlement agreement. So, I mean, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=524.8000000000001s)]
*  you bring in the lawsuit, you don't really even know who the settlement agreement with, who the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=531.6s)]
*  signatories are. And as a lawyer, as an attorney general, what are the most basic things you need [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=536.24s)]
*  to know when parties enter into a settlement agreement? I don't know who are the parties to it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=541.2s)]
*  Well, there's two issues here. One is there was a lawsuit that they're purporting to settle, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=546.4000000000001s)]
*  which has a bunch of organizations that are supposedly a part of it, including third parties, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=551.5200000000001s)]
*  and they won't tell us who they are. And then there's a bigger issue, which is that they're [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=557.76s)]
*  not just settling the lawsuit, they're implementing this policy that's going to put these machine gun [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=562.6400000000001s)]
*  conversion devices into the hands of anyone, regardless of whether they were a party to the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=567.04s)]
*  settlement, 12,000 that the ATF has collected over the years. And it takes about a day or two [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  to identify and dismantle one of these and make sure that that's what we're dealing with. They're [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=578.0799999999999s)]
*  putting those into hands across the country, and they're not telling us who they're going to give [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=582.56s)]
*  it to. So it very well could be violent, domestic violence offenders or other violent individuals. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=586.3199999999999s)]
*  And that is a really scary thing for the public. And as the chief law enforcement officer, whose [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=591.1999999999999s)]
*  job is to keep our residents safe at a time when we have historic low levels of gun violence in New [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=596.4s)]
*  Jersey, yeah, we're going to court to make sure the federal government cannot be a machine gun [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=601.52s)]
*  distributor to violent felons. I can't believe I have to say that, but that's what we're doing. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=605.92s)]
*  You know, and that is kind of the final point that, you know, the way the federal government [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=611.1999999999999s)]
*  is operating now, you know, reminds me of when I was in private practice as a lawyer, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=616.56s)]
*  and you would deal with a corporation that would claim everything is a trade secret, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=622.24s)]
*  and they wouldn't give you any information during discovery. And they would just try to obstruct and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=626.5600000000001s)]
*  shut everything down just through those types of games. It's just so odd seeing odds. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQDlNbim2k&t=632.48s)]
