Video Description: In this episode of the MeidasTouch Podcast, we break down Trump’s disgraceful Memorial Day message where, instead of honoring our fallen heroes, he used the occasion to attack his political enemies. We also expose MAGA Mike Johnson’s pathetic weekend show appearances as he struggles to defend the GOP’s disastrous budget bill, which is already facing major pushback in the Senate. Plus, Trump is now targeting key protections for Cuban immigrants—a direct attack on one of his own voting blocs. Ben, Brett and Jordy got all that and more.

# LIVE: MeidasTouch RESPONDS to MAJOR Breaking News - 5/26/25
**MeidasTouch:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU)
*  It's Memorial Day where we honor our troops who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=0.0s)]
*  But Memorial Day for Donald Trump means to make demented social media posts attacking [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=6.96s)]
*  judges and spreading his conspiracies and overall just embarrassing and humiliating [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=12.5s)]
*  the United States of America and not mentioning our troops at all. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=19.12s)]
*  This says we've now learned that federal judges, because of Donald Trump's attacks, don't even [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=24.0s)]
*  trust the U.S. Marshals anymore who are supposed to protect them from the threats since they [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=29.36s)]
*  technically work for the executive branch and they want their own special protection [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=35.6s)]
*  or they're just going to go out of pocket. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=41.04s)]
*  Folks, we're not in a constitutional crisis. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=42.92s)]
*  We're well beyond that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=45.92s)]
*  We're in an authoritarian regime where we need to resist and oppose and call it out. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=46.92s)]
*  Where Donald Trump gives a deranged speech at a West Point Army graduation and starts [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  talking about trophy wives and starts comparing himself to Al Capone, says that he doesn't [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=60.6s)]
*  like stealth technology because he doesn't like the shapes and he thinks he gave a speech [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  at the Ohio State University where he gave a speech in Alabama. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=72.48s)]
*  We here at the Midas Touch Network call it out and make it a big deal because it is and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=76.7s)]
*  it's having real world ramifications on our lives as this maniac destroys our country, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=83.08s)]
*  destroys our alliances, destroys our economy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=90.0s)]
*  Also today it's gone underreported so we should highlight it here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=94.2s)]
*  Donald Trump pardoned a corrupt Virginia sheriff who was found guilty of taking bribes to hand [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  out badges to people in the business community in Virginia. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=105.56s)]
*  This was someone who was sentenced to 10 years and the Trump DOJ even bragged about [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=109.72s)]
*  the sentencing back in March of 2025. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=115.48s)]
*  But Donald Trump said that this was a Biden witch hunt and Donald Trump putting more criminals [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=119.4s)]
*  back on the street. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=124.28s)]
*  I think it's also important we talk about the Trump budget disaster as well in the sense [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=125.64s)]
*  that the MAGA Republican senators who were making weekend news appearances said that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=131.98s)]
*  they're not going to be supporting it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=136.84s)]
*  We'll see ultimately if that takes place but that's at least what they said. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=139.44s)]
*  We'll talk about that and more on this episode of the Midas Touch podcast. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=144.12s)]
*  Brett and Jordi how are you guys doing? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=147.96s)]
*  I'm doing great. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=149.52s)]
*  It's great to be here with everybody and welcome everybody to this special Memorial Day edition [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=150.52s)]
*  of the Midas Touch podcast. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  I hope everybody's having a powerful day, a reflective day filled with gratitude for [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=155.52s)]
*  all the brave young men and women who gave their lives in service to our country and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=161.32s)]
*  of the reason why we are always doing this, why we get up every day and we all work so [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=167.04s)]
*  hard in order to get these messages out here because we want to live up to that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=171.4s)]
*  We want to be able to defend those same values. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=176.84s)]
*  So today we honor them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=179.28s)]
*  Thank you for making us part of your day here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  It's not just the day off. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=183.28s)]
*  It is a day to reflect and a day to continue the fight. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=184.28s)]
*  So we appreciate you being with us. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=187.44s)]
*  Jordi, how are you doing? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=189.76s)]
*  I'm doing well, brothers. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  Midas mighty. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=192.04s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=193.04s)]
*  I'm excited to get into the show today. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=194.04s)]
*  And so with that, Benji, where do you want to lead us off? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=195.48s)]
*  Well, let me reflect on the Memorial Day parade in my town just at the outset of this episode. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  You know, it was an overall great parade, but there was one part of the parade where [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=204.83999999999997s)]
*  the town Republican Club had their own kind of crew and they made it so Trumpy and they [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  had the Trump flag and they had all of the Trump stuff and all of this language. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  You know, DEI is bad. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=223.64s)]
*  We hate DEI. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=225.48s)]
*  And it was a little bit wild, too, because as I was watching some of the people in the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=226.48s)]
*  group, it wasn't just all kind of white people. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=230.12s)]
*  It was like a small group. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  And it was just, you know, coming into my town where we have a Democratic assemblyman, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  a Democratic senator in a blue state. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=238.04s)]
*  And just to see them making Memorial Day about Donald Trump with the Trump flag and they [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=242.16s)]
*  were playing the YMCA song, it just left a certain feeling with me, which is why. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=247.44s)]
*  I'm talking about it, but it's also important why I want to reflect on that, that we continue [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=253.6s)]
*  to build this pro-democracy community and we talk about things like that and we share [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=258.6s)]
*  it with others in our community, in real world settings, to let people know that that's not [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=264.16s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=269.6s)]
*  I'm not OK with people coming into my community and saying that they don't support diversity [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=270.6s)]
*  and inclusion in a community that actually is about diversity and inclusion. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=275.28s)]
*  So I always say it's important that we not normalize that behavior and we just speak [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=280.48s)]
*  about it and say, I'm not OK with that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=285.36s)]
*  I'm not cool with that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=287.32s)]
*  I support diversity and not be afraid of all the narratives out there that try to convince [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=288.72s)]
*  you otherwise. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=293.92s)]
*  And when I think about these narratives that try to convince you otherwise, you know, it's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=295.36s)]
*  this corporate news reflex to just try to watch a Trump speech and then report on it [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=299.6s)]
*  as though it's a completely different speech. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=307.04s)]
*  And maybe they're doing it for access. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  Maybe they're doing it because they're Trumpers and Trump cheerleaders. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  Maybe they're doing it because they're lazy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=316.36s)]
*  But I think it's important to be like, what the hell are you doing? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, I like some of the business reporting by Bloomberg. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  I like their podcast reporting at Bloomberg. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=325.44000000000005s)]
*  So when I saw a Bloomberg reporter take a look at that West Point graduation where Trump [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  gave a commencement speech and said some of President Trump's advice to West Point graduates [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  Don't lose your momentum. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=339.04s)]
*  Have the courage to take the risks and do things differently. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=340.0s)]
*  Never lose faith in America. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=343.56s)]
*  I watched these speeches. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=346.12s)]
*  He didn't say any of that ever. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=347.64s)]
*  He showed up disrespectfully wearing a red political campaign hat. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=349.92s)]
*  He railed about trophy wives being not good, but then good, but then not good. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=355.4s)]
*  He talked about how he didn't like stealth. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=360.56s)]
*  He compared himself to Al Capone. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=362.76s)]
*  He attacked the president. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=365.12s)]
*  To Al Capone. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=366.96s)]
*  He attacked former President Biden and former President Obama. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=368.36s)]
*  He made these deranged comments that there was nobody joining the army until him. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=372.03999999999996s)]
*  All of those grads who were there joined the army under former President Biden because [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=377.28s)]
*  they were there for four years and they were graduating now. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=382.0s)]
*  So when I watch that, it's the exact opposite. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=385.2s)]
*  Setting aside politics, it's the exact opposite of what this Bloomberg reporter Jennifer Duly [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  wrote about. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=393.32s)]
*  And it's just the exact opposite of what we should be teaching in my view, future leaders [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=394.24s)]
*  in the military, future leaders in general, and forget leaders, just people being decent, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=399.68s)]
*  good human beings. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  And so how on her list does she not mention the things that were happening? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=406.64s)]
*  I mean, where a United States president says he doesn't like stealth because the shapes [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=410.48s)]
*  and he thinks the shapes get outdated. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=416.84s)]
*  I don't even know what the hell he's does. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=418.59999999999997s)]
*  He thinks stealth literally means that the planes are actually invisible versus that [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=420.04s)]
*  they can't get detected on radar. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=424.44s)]
*  Here's what Trump says about stealth. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=426.16s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=427.8s)]
*  That's what they tell me. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=450.04s)]
*  And by the way, Donald Trump, they're talking about the trillion dollar budget because he [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=467.32000000000005s)]
*  likes the word trillion, which is part of what the Trump regime is doing that's going [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=472.0s)]
*  to add trillions of dollars to the deficit. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=477.66s)]
*  I mean, just look at the disastrous budget. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=480.82000000000005s)]
*  It increases the debt ceiling by $4 trillion over the next two years, meaning we're at [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=483.42s)]
*  a very minimum going to be running a $2 trillion annual deficit. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=488.5s)]
*  The next thing that Donald Trump talks about. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=493.42s)]
*  Can I answer your question for a second, not to interrupt your flow? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=494.90000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=497.26000000000005s)]
*  He absolutely thinks that stealth planes mean they're supposed to be invisible and he doesn't [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=497.62s)]
*  understand why they're not invisible. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=501.06s)]
*  And I wouldn't even know. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=502.46000000000004s)]
*  I'm not sure I would have even said that a few weeks ago, but going back to that incident [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=503.74s)]
*  with ABC and the Kilmar, Brego Garcia, the MS-13 tattoo where Trump literally thought [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=507.38s)]
*  that that was the actual tattoo. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=512.26s)]
*  I now realize I think he actually thinks this stuff. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=513.86s)]
*  Like, I think he is actually that stupid when it comes to this sort of thing. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=516.02s)]
*  He's that he's that stupid and his people, his followers and stuff end up just parroting [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=518.9399999999999s)]
*  these ridiculous comments that he makes. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=523.06s)]
*  100% he thinks stealth planes are actually invisible. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=525.34s)]
*  Here he is on Trophy Wives. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=529.74s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=531.34s)]
*  Company and he had nothing to do. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=532.26s)]
*  He ended up getting a divorce, found a new wife. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=536.02s)]
*  Could you say a trophy wife? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=540.8199999999999s)]
*  I guess we can say a trophy wife. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=542.1s)]
*  It didn't work out too well, but it doesn't. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=544.46s)]
*  And that doesn't work out too well. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=547.14s)]
*  I must tell you, a lot of trophy wives doesn't work out, but it made him happy for a little [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=548.62s)]
*  while at least. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=553.8199999999999s)]
*  But he found a new wife. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=555.14s)]
*  He sold his little boat. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=558.1s)]
*  He got a big yacht. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=559.26s)]
*  He had one of the biggest yachts anywhere in the world. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=560.18s)]
*  Compares himself to Al Capone. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=564.1s)]
*  Play the clip. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=566.1s)]
*  And the American people, because they're always going to be there for you. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=567.1s)]
*  I went through a very tough time with some very radicalized, sick people. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=570.5s)]
*  And I say I was investigated more than the great late Alphonse Capone. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=576.38s)]
*  Alphonse Capone was a monster. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=581.9s)]
*  It was a very hardened criminal. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=584.34s)]
*  I went through more investigations than Alphonse Capone. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=586.74s)]
*  And now I'm talking to you as president. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=590.66s)]
*  You believe this? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=592.7s)]
*  I mean, how humiliating. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=594.9000000000001s)]
*  And then he believes that he spoke at the Ohio State University as his last [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=596.46s)]
*  commencement speech when he spoke at Alabama University. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=602.1400000000001s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=605.62s)]
*  Army careers. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=606.62s)]
*  And I thought I'd do this and I can make this to a civilian audience or to a military [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=608.0200000000001s)]
*  audience. It's pretty much the same. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=613.46s)]
*  And I did this recently at Ohio State. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=616.1400000000001s)]
*  And they really liked it. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=621.66s)]
*  I gave them a little advice as to what I see for what you want to do and some tips. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=622.66s)]
*  I mean, just can I just get in here real quick, Brett? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=631.3s)]
*  Can you please bring up what the Bloomberg reporter wrote about what Donald Trump said [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=634.62s)]
*  during this? So again, for our audio listeners, this is what this Bloomberg reporter wrote [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=638.6999999999999s)]
*  about this. And look, I don't like attacking or going after reporters for the sake of doing [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=643.4599999999999s)]
*  it. But something I say often on the show is don't be gaslit by corporate media. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=648.3s)]
*  And this is exactly what I'm talking about. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=652.02s)]
*  So this is again, this is what the Bloomberg reporter said that Donald Trump said during [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=655.02s)]
*  his speech. Do what you love. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=658.3s)]
*  Think big, work hard and never give up. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=660.1s)]
*  Don't lose your momentum. Have the courage to take risks and do things differently. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=662.42s)]
*  Never lose your faith in America. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=666.86s)]
*  And here's all I want to say about this is, look, I don't want corporate media out [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=668.8199999999999s)]
*  there to lie and make things up about what Donald Trump is saying. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=675.9s)]
*  But you don't have to cover for the guy in this bizarro way. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=682.18s)]
*  I'm just simply asking, please just report on what he's actually saying, because it is [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=687.06s)]
*  absolute lunacy. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=695.06s)]
*  Trophy wives, Al Capone, Ohio State, like he doesn't know what stealth is. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=697.9399999999999s)]
*  This person has the nuclear codes. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=705.26s)]
*  And what are we going to how? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=708.42s)]
*  How is corporate media going to cover this? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=709.74s)]
*  They're going to ignore it and trying gaslight you listeners and viewers and say, no, no, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=712.38s)]
*  no, this is what he said. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=717.74s)]
*  It was actually and I just honestly, I have to ask why. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=719.62s)]
*  Is it because corporate media? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=723.22s)]
*  You're scared that Donald Trump's going to see your tweet about him like just you [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=724.62s)]
*  reporting on his actual words and then he's going to get mad at you and call you a mean [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=729.22s)]
*  nickname, say nasty Bloomberg reporter. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=733.82s)]
*  If that's the case, this isn't the profession for you. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=736.7s)]
*  And I don't mean it to be rude, but I'm just honestly saying, please, for our country, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=740.1400000000001s)]
*  just report on what he's saying, because it's bizarro land and people need to actually [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=745.1400000000001s)]
*  see this stuff. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=751.3000000000001s)]
*  That's why I'm so happy we play these clips. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=752.58s)]
*  I think they're just so lost in like this corporate media brain that I've noticed. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=754.9000000000001s)]
*  Like some people have corporate media brain and they can't escape it like and they just [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=758.5400000000001s)]
*  have to think a certain way. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=762.2600000000001s)]
*  And I think it's because when you come up in these structures, you're you're taught to [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=763.62s)]
*  kind of report a certain way. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=767.74s)]
*  Right. I'm going to I need to give this side some certain credence, then I get me to give [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=768.98s)]
*  this side a voice as well. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=772.62s)]
*  And then we let the audience. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=774.06s)]
*  The truth is going to be somewhere in the mix of those two things. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=775.14s)]
*  So we say this side did this. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=777.3s)]
*  This side did that. You decide audience because we can't seem biased. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=778.5s)]
*  A reporter's biggest fear throughout their kind of careers is to appear biased. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=782.34s)]
*  The issue is we're not in normal times right now. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=788.02s)]
*  And when you're not in normal times and you have somebody who has so thrown off [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=790.5s)]
*  everything about what it means to be an American, all you're doing is you're allowing [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=795.38s)]
*  this individual to move the Overton window so far to the right, so far to the right, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=799.7s)]
*  because you are normalizing that behavior, because this is not just about Bloomberg. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=805.38s)]
*  This is an infection that has spread throughout so much of the corporate media. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=809.42s)]
*  And I'll pull up this example as well, not to harp on this for too long. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=813.3s)]
*  But let me show you a tale of two headlines right here. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=817.02s)]
*  Here is how the New York Times reported on this speech yesterday. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=820.9s)]
*  You know, here's their headline. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=825.5799999999999s)]
*  Trump gives commencement address at West Point, stressing a new era. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=827.1s)]
*  The president said the graduating cadets would enter a service no longer subject to [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=831.86s)]
*  absurd ideological experiments or nation building crusades. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=836.1s)]
*  Now, let me compare that to how they did this overseas at the Independent and shout [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=839.98s)]
*  out to the Independent for their headline, which told the truth here. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=843.8199999999999s)]
*  The Independent said Trump gives rambling speech about Trophy Wives, Golf and the [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=847.06s)]
*  great late Al Capone and politically charged West Point address. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=852.18s)]
*  That's now that is an accurate description of what we all saw. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=856.4599999999999s)]
*  And so just the fact that so many of these outlets are going with that first New York [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=860.26s)]
*  Times sort of style to try to just placate people and say, hey, listen, we're not [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=864.3s)]
*  biased, we're just telling you what happened here. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=869.5s)]
*  You're not, though, because you're actually withholding the dangerous things that [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=872.06s)]
*  people need to know about. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=875.26s)]
*  And that's how you soften these rough edges, which is to say the least. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=876.54s)]
*  And you make somebody like Donald Trump palatable. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=880.5s)]
*  I rarely watch local news, but every time I do watch local news, I'm, you know, a [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=882.6999999999999s)]
*  lot of great local news reporting when they cover these events, though, in many of [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=887.9399999999999s)]
*  these cities and towns throughout America. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=891.54s)]
*  What you end up seeing is the way they frame it. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=894.38s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump came to, you know, whatever Idaho today, and he spoke about [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=897.46s)]
*  he wanted to make America great. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=903.02s)]
*  Then they'll play like three seconds of Donald Trump saying, we got to be great. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=904.5400000000001s)]
*  And the crowd cheered. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=908.7800000000001s)]
*  And then he did his signature dance moves and walked off the stage and everybody [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=910.4200000000001s)]
*  applied and you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=913.86s)]
*  That is not exactly what happened there. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=917.1800000000001s)]
*  Like, let's tell people what went down, but that's just not, that's just not what [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=919.6600000000001s)]
*  we're getting. And I think it's part of the reason why we're in the place that [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=923.14s)]
*  we're in right now. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=925.62s)]
*  This journalistic negligence or outright maliciousness, depending on how you view [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=926.62s)]
*  it, has real world implications here because it doesn't erase what is taking [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=932.22s)]
*  place. You're just hiding it from a subset of Americans. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=937.38s)]
*  Fortunately, the Midas Touch network is growing bigger than a lot of these [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=941.38s)]
*  corporate news networks and we're the most viewed now out there. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=944.98s)]
*  But there's still a lot of people who get their news from disinformation centers or [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=948.62s)]

*  looking at a lot recently is Little Havana in Miami where Donald Trump's support among the Cuban [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2042.62s)]
*  community is strong a very very strong it's changed the whole dynamics of kind of Florida politics [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2049.34s)]
*  which was once a purplish state then became a ruby ruby red state and a lot of it was the [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2057.26s)]
*  Cuban and Venezuelan population in Florida and some other Latino populations that are that are [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2063.1000000000004s)]
*  there as well I've been very supportive of kind of Trump and MAGA and what's so wild to me about it [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2069.82s)]
*  is that every single day Donald Trump does more and more things to let that population know how [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2076.5400000000004s)]
*  much he hates them like like the most brutal type of stuff so under former President Biden [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2082.94s)]
*  the Cubans the Venezuelans and others had temporary protected status was a major [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2088.38s)]
*  priority to protect these communities from Castro in Cuba from Maduro in Venezuela and without any [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2094.78s)]
*  hesitation Biden would make sure that these communities were protected and then you would [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2102.78s)]
*  have a lot of MAGA Republican senators like Marco Rubio when he was a senator of Florida [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2107.6600000000003s)]
*  make that kind of his big priority I mean in fact when it came to this rapper named L Funky I think [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2112.7s)]
*  was the guy's name you know Marco Rubio used this Cuban rapper's you know lyrics to basically [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2119.02s)]
*  be the name of this bill to put more sanctions on on Cuba I think was Patria Evita was the name of [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2125.98s)]
*  the bill and was also the name of this kind of protest rally song that was really inspirational [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2132.86s)]
*  to Cuban dissidents you know but Donald Trump's like targeting these people like like like [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2140.3s)]
*  this guy L Funky is part of the Cuban community that's going to be sent back to the Castro regime [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2145.5s)]
*  their immigration status has been revoked by Donald Trump under the initial kind of Cuban [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2152.54s)]
*  protection the various kind of Cuban protection acts that's not even including the next wave where [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2160.1400000000003s)]
*  the same way the Venezuelan temporary protected status has been revoked it's going to be [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2165.7400000000002s)]
*  you know you know it's going to be revoked with Cubans as well and and frankly all groups across [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2169.66s)]
*  all of these Latino groups across the country and so like let me just share with you this was some [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2176.06s)]
*  recent reporting in Little Havana in Cuba just just watch this it's it's mind-boggling to me [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2182.54s)]
*  here play this clip on a recent visit to Miami's Little Havana neighborhood we found conversation [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2188.22s)]
*  about temporary protected status heating up you think it's bad for them to remove the status [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2193.58s)]
*  but you still approve president Trump so you continue to support the president [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2199.02s)]
*  this is iconic domino park where many Cuban Americans come to enjoy their favorite pastime [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2207.2599999999998s)]
*  playing dominoes and in between games some have told us that they agree with president Trump on [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2212.94s)]
*  most things except this Cubans Venezuelans should have a right to be protected clearly yes she said [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2217.98s)]
*  so we support him on everything other than the thing where he wants us basically dead [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2229.02s)]
*  other than the thing where he wants us killed and you start to think about that and and you don't [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2237.74s)]
*  just think about that from the perspective of Cubans or Venezuelans or you just think about it [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2244.54s)]
*  you know with how he's treated red states when it comes to FEMA not sending FEMA into red states [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2252.22s)]
*  gutting the national weather service and national oceanic and atmospheric agencies [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2259.02s)]
*  when you when you see how he's taking away snap benefits we'll talk about the budget in a little [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2265.42s)]
*  bit you know I saw when MAGA Mike Johnson was being interviewed on the Sunday shows and he was [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2271.98s)]
*  railing against how bad snap is Louisiana gets more snap than any state other than one [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2279.1s)]
*  so so you're you're literally kind of killing your people but going back to where we started [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2284.8599999999997s)]
*  this episode Jordi and Brett there's been this overwhelming amount of propaganda out there [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2290.2999999999997s)]
*  that make people feel that there are these other issues to focus on but when it comes down to like [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2297.1s)]
*  I don't know to me the issues that would be most impactful to me first would be my my wife and my [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2303.18s)]
*  my my wife and my kid my family then probably me living and then the community and and and and [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2309.34s)]
*  then I probably branch out a little bit but where they're directly attacking your literal existence [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2317.82s)]
*  your ability to live it's it's just a it's a it's a wild concept and it's a segue into talking about [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2325.58s)]
*  this budget because the the the factions when we talk about the senators who don't support this bill [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2332.2999999999997s)]
*  it's not like they're great people they don't support it because they want more cuts to Medicaid [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2341.02s)]
*  they want more people suffering Brett and Jordi that that's why they want the cuts [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2346.54s)]
*  yeah and I did a deep dive on the El Funke story uh over the weekend and I was reading about the [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2351.8199999999997s)]
*  guy and like this is how extreme it is he says that if he is sent back to Cuba he will be [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2356.22s)]
*  imprisoned and would likely could likely end up dead because he did this major protest anthem which [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2361.58s)]
*  led to a lot of protests in the country and so his life is literally at risk because of Donald [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2367.66s)]
*  Trump's administration yet he still supports Trump and and has supported Trump and the whole thing is [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2372.7s)]
*  just so mind-blowing to me the thing that always just really confuses me and I think this is going [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2377.98s)]
*  to your point then of the of the propaganda is that Trump resembles all of these autocrats who [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2383.02s)]
*  they are fleeing that's who Trump like idolizes that's who he tries to be in the in the mold of [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2390.46s)]
*  when Donald Trump does everything that he does he's following the same playbook as these communist [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2396.38s)]
*  dictators he's as I said in a previous episode and I'm not being facetious about it I think [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2401.34s)]
*  Donald Trump is most similar to a communist leader in one of these countries than we have seen uh in [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2406.46s)]

*  from Trump from all these MAGA people remember the $750 number that they would throw out the [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2455.18s)]
*  United States government is only giving $750 to help clean up this mess that wasn't true that was [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2460.06s)]
*  an immediate payment to help people with their immediate expenses which was something passed by [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2465.74s)]
*  Congress that FEMA was allowed as the maximum amount they were able to actually pay for that [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2469.66s)]
*  and then there was a whole lot of other money that was paid out to these communities and people [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2474.14s)]
*  who applied for assistance uh assistance that that Donald Trump and those MAGA people tried to [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2477.8199999999997s)]

*  and they're being forced to beg for help right now and this government is not doing anything and [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2492.7s)]
*  they don't even acknowledge it which is part of their strategy as well just pretend like nothing [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2497.98s)]

*  this crazy bill and when we look at this bill it's clearly like the biggest debt deficit bomb that we [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2512.86s)]
*  have ever seen in the country and Ben I remember you making these predictions uh before Trump even [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2519.18s)]

*  its intended goals were to make the government more efficient to save the government money [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2557.9s)]
*  it's the biggest failure maybe in any government's history ever I mean adding four trillion dollars [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2562.1400000000003s)]
*  to the deficit I'm adding like 20 trillion dollars in debt this was supposed to save us money and [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2567.1000000000004s)]

*  are grounding this in the reality of what's going on and cut right past all the propaganda [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=2614.06s)]

*  like try to give them props like what they're trying to do is cut medicaid and to cut more [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3372.46s)]
*  services that people actually need while giving the tax cuts to the billionaires and let me be [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3377.74s)]
*  very clear you want to know how you solve this you tax rich people more okay rich people should [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3384.3s)]
*  pay more taxes it's a very simple solution if very rich people paid more taxes they would still be [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3389.1800000000003s)]
*  very very rich and they would have wealth for generations and generations and generations and [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3395.82s)]
*  more generations okay and they would be able to actually be patriotic by supporting our country [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3401.9s)]
*  it's a very basic solution we should be loud about that idea unflinching in that idea and [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3408.54s)]
*  we shouldn't be worried oh my god are we going to sound like no that that's where the american [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3415.66s)]
*  people are stop doubting yourself american people aren't billionaires or deca millionaires okay [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3420.3s)]
*  most americans are psychologically tortured living paycheck to paycheck and they support the idea [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3425.7400000000002s)]
*  of taxing rich people more first off we could start by taxing rich people fairly which they're [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3431.58s)]
*  not even being fairly taxed they pay less actual taxes and definitely less percentage wise of taxes [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3437.34s)]
*  than most americans pay in general heck when we saw trump's federal taxes there were years where [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3444.38s)]
*  he paid zero dollars or he paid 750 which is basically the filing fee also in this big budget [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3449.58s)]
*  bill disaster they are cutting the ability for free tax filing as well so like they're even cutting [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3456.06s)]
*  your ability to go through the irs free tax filing system which was very popular so just say it loud [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3462.22s)]
*  and proud rich people need to be taxed more you don't have to over complicate it with slogans [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3468.54s)]
*  that's not like oh my god we need to find our next joe rogan no just be a normal human being [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3473.66s)]
*  and speak to where people are if you listen to people you know where they are and it's just [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3478.54s)]
*  doing the right thing like here's magna mike johnson talking about how he wants to cut snap [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3482.9399999999996s)]
*  from his own people which louisiana gets more snap than every state other than one play this [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3488.86s)]
*  clip we don't want to slash benefits and again i make this very clear we are not cutting medicaid [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3494.3s)]
*  we are not cutting snap we're working in the elements of fraud, waste, and abuse. Snap for [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3499.6600000000003s)]
*  example uh listen to the statistics in 2024 over 11 billion dollars in snap payments were were [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3503.9s)]
*  erroneous i mean that's that's a number that everyone acknowledges is real it may be much [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3511.02s)]
*  higher than that but here's the problem the states let me explain it margaret let me explain [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3515.42s)]
*  it the states the states are not properly administering this because they don't have [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3521.26s)]
*  enough skin in the game so what we've done in the bill is add some just a modest state sharing [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3525.98s)]
*  component so that they'll pay attention to that so that we can reduce fraud why again so that it [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3530.3s)]
*  is preserved for the people that need it the most this is common sense margaret it's good government [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3534.94s)]
*  and everybody on both sides of the aisle should agree to that well center so then what he's saying [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3539.98s)]
*  that everybody in his state basically commits are all committing fraud basically is is that what [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3546.54s)]
*  the argument is no they're getting rid of medicaid okay they are getting rid of they are getting rid [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3553.34s)]
*  of snap programs and what it's going to be maga mike johnson and donald trump their central body [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3560.46s)]
*  is going to be the ones to make determinations of who's able-bodied who's not able-bodied there [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3567.02s)]
*  they're the ones who are going to make those determinations and there are already a lot of [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3573.1s)]
*  requirements like that that exist already and it's a very dim view about the american people [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3576.94s)]
*  that what the american people are so what they're they're they're so hungry for food that they're [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3584.54s)]
*  making up that they have isn't there a broader issue there taking place that if you're saying [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3592.06s)]
*  that americans need to make up lies in order to be handed food so that they could be able to [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3597.1s)]
*  live and actually feed their freaking family in the first place or maybe just maybe where the [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3604.62s)]
*  fraud is actually coming from is people like these maga republican billionaires who run the biggest [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3610.86s)]
*  medicaid fraud in history oh wait maga republican senator scott from florida was involved in the [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3617.74s)]
*  biggest medicaid fraud in history so if you want to know where the fraud is actually taking place [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3623.58s)]
*  from it's usually from a lot of the big republican donors who are the ones like actually implementing [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-npzIIwlBU&t=3628.2999999999997s)]
