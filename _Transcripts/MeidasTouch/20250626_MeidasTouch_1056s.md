# Trump has MASSIVE PANIC in AM after DISASTER NEWS
**MeidasTouch:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8)
*  Donald Trump is having a complete meltdown on Thursday morning as now European intelligence [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=0.0s)]
*  confirms what American intelligence confirmed, that the United States military strikes against [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=6.32s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear facilities were not as successful as Donald Trump claimed, that Iran [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=12.84s)]
*  will likely be able to rebuild a nuclear program and that Iran was able to move the uranium [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=18.76s)]
*  out before these strikes took place. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=24.72s)]
*  Earlier in the morning Donald Trump had his Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth give a press [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  conference which may have been the most shameful moment in the history of the Department of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  Defense where Pete Hegseth just started attacking reporters and saying you should just be waving [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=38.72s)]
*  the American flag and shut up. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=45.16s)]
*  And he would go to different reporters and say you're the worst and you're the worst. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=48.2s)]
*  Just shut up and report on what the regime wants you to report. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=52.36s)]
*  Donald Trump has been calling himself Daddy all day. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=57.8s)]
*  He's been posting photos on Instagram basically saying to call him Daddy and now he's also [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=62.04s)]
*  selling t-shirts with his face on it and I think it's his mugshot which is also his presidential [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=68.2s)]
*  portrait which says Daddy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=74.52s)]
*  He's selling Daddy orange t-shirts. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=76.64s)]
*  Let's just go through what's happening this morning so you can see the meltdown that's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=80.2s)]
*  taking place and you can just see how unprofessional and how despicable this is while Donald Trump [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=84.8s)]
*  is causing havoc on the home front and you have this disastrous budget bill that's attacking [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  the American people. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=97.44s)]
*  Although I have a positive update on the disastrous budget bill that I'll talk about in this video. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=98.44s)]
*  So here's what Donald Trump posted early in the morning all in caps. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  Fake news reporters from CNN and the New York Times should be fired immediately exclamation [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=109.2s)]
*  point bad people with evil intentions. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=116.56s)]
*  And then he's now selling this shirt right here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=121.36s)]
*  It's called the Daddy merch collection from the official Trump account. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=124.56s)]
*  It's a photo of himself on an orange shirt and then it says Daddy under it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  Here's what we're learning about the European intelligence. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=135.64s)]
*  Early intelligence suggests Iran's uranium largely intact. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=139.76s)]
*  European officials say preliminary assessments indicate that Tehran was able to move much [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=145.27999999999997s)]
*  of its nuclear stockpile. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=151.27999999999997s)]
*  Intelligence suggests that Iran's stockpile of uranium enriched close to weapons grade [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=154.2s)]
*  levels was not concentrated in the Fordow facility at the time of last weekend's attack. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=159.32s)]
*  So now talking about Secretary of Defense former Fox weekend host Pete Hegsitz press [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=167.48s)]
*  conference earlier this morning. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=174.0s)]
*  Here's how Donald Trump described it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=177.0s)]
*  One of the greatest most professional and most quote confirming news conferences I have [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  ever seen exclamation point. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=187.6s)]
*  What's a confirming news conference? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=189.72s)]
*  The fake news should fire everyone involved in the witch hunt and apologize to our great [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=192.2s)]
*  warriors and everyone else exclamation point. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=199.08s)]
*  So one of the things that Donald Trump and Hegsith are doing and I think it's beyond [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=203.4s)]
*  despicable is they're claiming that the B2 pilots who were involved in the mission against [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=208.76s)]
*  Iran are very sad and they're almost crying. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=215.45999999999998s)]
*  They're almost in tears according to Trump and Hegsith because they're being treated [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=218.94s)]
*  very meanly by the media who says that the strikes weren't as effective as the regime [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  claims the strikes were. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=229.54s)]
*  So Donald Trump says that if you accurately report on what the intelligence is from our [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=231.33999999999997s)]
*  own intelligence community what the Pentagon said what CENTCOM said what the European officials [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=237.54s)]
*  said you're being mean to the B2 fighters and that's really disrespectful to our troops. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=243.66s)]
*  That's what the regime is going with. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=249.85999999999999s)]
*  So here's what went down at that press conference. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=251.94s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin who asks this question she is the main defense correspondent for Fox. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=255.1s)]
*  So she works at Fox. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=264.82s)]
*  So this is a Fox host. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=265.82s)]
*  Although she works at Fox she's very respected in the space of reporting on the defense department [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=267.62s)]
*  and on the military and she usually gets her facts right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=272.86s)]
*  She's known as just a good reporter. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=276.46s)]
*  So here she is asking a question to Hegsith and then Hegsith attacks her and says Jennifer [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=279.78s)]
*  you've been the absolute worst. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=286.42s)]
*  Here play this clue. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=289.14s)]
*  We've seen that suggests that we didn't hit exactly what we wanted to hit in those locations. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=290.14s)]
*  It's about highly enriched uranium. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=296.34s)]
*  Do you have certainty that all the highly enriched uranium was inside the Fordow Mountain [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=298.78s)]
*  or some of it because there were satellite photos that showed more than a dozen trucks [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=304.94s)]
*  there two days in advance. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=309.46s)]
*  Are you certain none of that highly enriched uranium was moved? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=311.21999999999997s)]
*  Of course we're watching every single aspect but Jennifer you've been about the worst. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=314.14s)]
*  The one who misrepresents the most intentionally what the president says. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=319.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm familiar. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=325.26s)]
*  I heard about the ventilation shafts on Saturday night and in fact I was the first to describe [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=326.34s)]
*  the B2 bombers the refueling the entire mission with great accuracy. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=332.34s)]
*  So I take issue with that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=337.82s)]
*  I appreciate you acknowledging that this is the first operation the most successful mission [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=339.14s)]
*  based on operational security that this department has done since you've been here and I appreciate [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=345.3s)]
*  that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=349.18s)]
*  So we're looking at all aspects of intelligence. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=350.18s)]
*  I mean again just think about the behavior by Hegseth there. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=352.34000000000003s)]
*  That does not exude confidence. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=356.98s)]
*  I mean to Trump and Hegseth and I guess people who don't know what tough guys actually are [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=359.18s)]
*  they think that that's a tough guy act but it shows to me that you're covering something [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=365.58000000000004s)]
*  up. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=370.38s)]
*  If you're so defensive about a basic question are you certain none of that highly enriched [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=371.38s)]
*  uranium was moved because all of the intelligence says it was and you go and attack the question. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=377.18s)]
*  It just tells me that you're covering things up. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=382.38s)]
*  That's weakness. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=384.98s)]
*  What Trump's doing is weakness. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=386.26s)]
*  What Hegseth does what this whole regime does to me is weakness masquerading as strength. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=387.7s)]
*  So then Pete Hegseth opens up that press conference attacking the media and ranting that Donald [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=393.38s)]
*  Trump directed the most complex and secretive military operation in history. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=399.42s)]
*  Now what took place in Iran was the single greatest American military feat ever. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=405.54s)]
*  The D-Day. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=412.34000000000003s)]
*  The Iran bombing. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=413.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=415.78000000000003s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=417.14000000000004s)]
*  Let me read the bottom line here. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=418.14000000000004s)]
*  President Trump directed the most complex and secretive military operation in history. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  And I'm not going to show you many more clips. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=427.18s)]
*  I'll show you one more just so I want to give you full context of what's taking place. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=428.82000000000005s)]
*  Here Pete Hegseth just continues to attack the press and this was all this was about. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=434.98s)]
*  He attacks the press. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=440.18s)]
*  He goes, it's in your DNA. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=441.34000000000003s)]
*  You hate Trump. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=443.02s)]
*  You're never Trumpers. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=444.26s)]
*  You hate him. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=445.26s)]
*  So you are trying to make him look bad. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=446.26s)]
*  And that is mean. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=448.46s)]
*  That's what they were doing all morning. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=450.34000000000003s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=451.98s)]
*  Because you and I mean specifically you the press, specifically you the press corps, because [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=455.82s)]
*  you cheer against Trump so hard. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=462.86s)]
*  It's like in your DNA and in your blood to cheer against Trump because you want him not [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=465.82s)]
*  to be successful so bad. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=471.06s)]
*  You have to cheer against the efficacy of these strikes. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=473.66s)]
*  You have to hope maybe they weren't effective. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=477.22s)]
*  Maybe the way the Trump administration is represented them isn't true. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=480.2s)]
*  So let's take half truths, spun information, leaked information and then spin it, spin [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=483.14s)]
*  it in every way we can to try to cause doubt and manipulate the mind, the public mind over [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=491.18s)]
*  whether or not our brave pilots were successful. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=498.22s)]
*  How many stories have been written about how hard it is to, I don't know, fly a plane for [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=502.46000000000004s)]
*  36 hours? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=506.62s)]
*  I need to tell you about one of my favorite products, Mudwater. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=509.06s)]
*  Mudwater provides sustained energy without the spikes and crash of traditional coffee. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=512.74s)]
*  There's also caffeine free blends available. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=517.62s)]
*  Their OG blend is a mix of cocoa, chai, turmeric and adaptogenic mushrooms to help you feel [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=520.14s)]
*  focused without the crash. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=525.38s)]
*  And the best part, it's amazing over ice. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=527.38s)]

*  So as our editor in chief said, Hegseth's entire press conference was all about accomplishing [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=615.0999999999999s)]
*  one thing, pleasing his audience of one, and he's proud of his pat on the head. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=620.3599999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump posted after that press conference, one of the greatest, most professional and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=626.42s)]
*  most confirming news conferences, as I said before. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=631.3399999999999s)]
*  And then Hegseth goes, thank you, Mr. President. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=634.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, on the home front, there's more bad economic news. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=638.36s)]
*  Remember when the first quarter GDP numbers were revealed and it was negative 0.2%? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=644.0s)]
*  Well now we know it's actually worse than that. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=652.36s)]
*  The first quarter GDP growth was actually revised further down to negative 0.5%. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=655.0799999999999s)]
*  Contraction of the economy. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=663.16s)]
*  Now that is a stark drop from the previous quarter's 2.4% as Stephen Ratner notes. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=665.02s)]
*  Just look at the difference between the Biden economy and the Trump economy right there. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=672.8399999999999s)]
*  Also close to 70% of US consumers think there's going to be a recession within the next year [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=679.48s)]
*  based on how erratic Donald Trump is handling things. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=687.6999999999999s)]
*  Remember I said that there was good news on the disastrous budget bill? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=692.24s)]
*  One of the things I was honored to share with you, and maybe you caught it yesterday, we [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=696.5600000000001s)]
*  held on the Midas Touch network on our YouTube channel an exclusive press conference by the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=701.0400000000001s)]
*  Democratic leaders in the Budget Committee who laid out all of the issues that were major [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=708.6400000000001s)]
*  problems with the disastrous budget bill. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=714.76s)]
*  And I know you all like that feature, so shout out to them for doing that as well. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=717.08s)]
*  It got a lot of views as well. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=721.44s)]
*  But one of the things that just happened in the Senate now threatens to destroy the entire [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=723.8000000000001s)]
*  budget bill, which is a great thing. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=729.1600000000001s)]
*  So the Senate parliamentarian, that's a position that makes sure the Senate is conforming to [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=731.5200000000001s)]
*  the rules. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=739.2s)]
*  And one of the rules is on a budget bill, if a provision is not directly budgetary in [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=740.9200000000001s)]
*  nature, it's called the Bird Rule. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=747.6800000000001s)]
*  You can't pass it through reconciliation. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=749.96s)]
*  So passing something through reconciliation, first and foremost, you can only really pass [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=753.12s)]
*  budget and taxing things through reconciliations, and you don't need 60 votes. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=757.6800000000001s)]
*  So you can avoid the filibuster if you can just get 50, 51 votes ultimately. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=764.32s)]
*  Vance could break a tiebreaker, but you can avoid the filibuster if it's through reconciliation. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=770.88s)]
*  If it is outside of budgetary means, you need at least 60 votes and then there can [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=777.68s)]
*  be a filibuster and the Republicans don't have the votes. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=783.2399999999999s)]
*  So the Senate parliamentarian analyzes the provisions of a budget bill to see are they [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=786.56s)]
*  allowed or if they're non-budgetary, then you could filibuster it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=793.06s)]
*  So the Senate parliamentarian just struck down, just struck a massive blow to Republicans' [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=798.02s)]
*  Medicaid cuts per an announcement from the Senate budget dems that it's not compliant [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=804.42s)]
*  with the Bird Rule, meaning they need to be stripped or overruled. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=810.2199999999999s)]
*  That's what I was just basically saying to you. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=815.62s)]
*  So the provider tax crackdown, which basically prevents states from taxing medical providers [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=818.3399999999999s)]
*  to fund Medicaid, that's one of the ways Medicaid would be destroyed, that that could not be [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=826.8399999999999s)]
*  put in reconciliation, limiting the federal money for states that allow undocumented immigrants [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=832.46s)]
*  to get Medicaid, additional limits on Medicaid, Medicare and Affordable Care Act premium tax [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=838.76s)]
*  credits for immigrants who are in citizens, and then some other things like that. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=843.86s)]
*  But the big one right there is the provider tax crackdown. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=849.34s)]
*  So this could blow up the entire scheme by the MAGA Republicans to destroy Medicaid because [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=852.6800000000001s)]
*  the provider tax crackdown was a big one of how they wanted to get rid of Medicaid. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=858.98s)]
*  Basically shift everything to the states, shift the burden to the states, and the states [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=864.1800000000001s)]
*  aren't able to shoulder the burden of funding Medicaid. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=868.94s)]
*  Then you limit the provider tax that the states can then tax the providers in order to try, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=873.4200000000001s)]
*  which they still wouldn't be able to do, to fund Medicaid, and then you just destroy the [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=881.4200000000001s)]
*  whole program. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=885.88s)]
*  So that was their trick to build it, but the parliamentarians said, nope, you can't do [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=886.88s)]
*  that. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=891.52s)]
*  More posts here by Donald Trump saying daddy's home, daddy's home. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=892.52s)]
*  How weird is that? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=896.64s)]
*  He's making posts saying daddy's home. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=897.64s)]
*  Also earlier in the morning, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini delivered a video. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=899.64s)]
*  He doesn't seem to be afraid of the Trump regime. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=906.12s)]
*  His video was, you know, look, it's obviously Iranian propaganda and it should be taken [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=909.56s)]
*  for the propaganda that it is, but I think it's important to see that Khomeini views [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=914.5799999999999s)]
*  this as a victory. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=920.4599999999999s)]
*  That's what he's celebrating, this ceasefire right now, because in his mind, they still [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=921.54s)]
*  have their nuclear program. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=928.4s)]
*  Donald Trump's encouraging oil sales between Iran and China, and the strikes didn't fully [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=930.9599999999999s)]
*  destroy the facilities. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=938.3199999999999s)]
*  So Khomeini congratulates everybody, you know, he congratulates his people. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=940.34s)]
*  I'm not going to go through all Khomeini's propaganda, but he released a video saying [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=944.9s)]
*  that Iran won, which, you know, is on the one hand, you have Trump regime propaganda, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=949.0400000000001s)]
*  on the other hand, you have Ayatollah propaganda. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=954.94s)]
*  The Department of Defense official rapid response account says, at Secretary of Defense just [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=958.7800000000001s)]
*  called out the fake news. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=966.1s)]
*  I mean specifically you, the press corps, because you cheer against Trump so hard, it's [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=968.54s)]
*  like it's in your DNA, in your blood to cheer against Trump. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=974.58s)]
*  And the way they spell corps is not C-O-R-P-S, they spelt it C-O-R-E, because we are led [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=978.3s)]
*  by a bunch of dummies. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=986.96s)]
*  Finally, a lot of people were asking in this bizarre picture of Donald Trump at NATO, why [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=988.74s)]
*  his pants are so big, like he used these gigantic pants. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=994.4599999999999s)]
*  And again, there are a lot of people in the past who have speculated whether or not he [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=999.66s)]
*  wears a Foley catheter. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=1003.26s)]
*  I'm not a medical doctor, so I don't know one way or another, but it's yet another example [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=1005.6999999999999s)]
*  of him wearing ridiculously gigantic pants, you know. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=1011.3399999999999s)]
*  And when you see his behavior, I did a video this morning on how sickly he looks, how cognitively [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=1016.5s)]
*  addled he presents, how he can't speak in sentences, and frankly the ramifications [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=1023.3s)]
*  that's having on our country and the world. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfxRRUNqmT8&t=1030.5s)]
