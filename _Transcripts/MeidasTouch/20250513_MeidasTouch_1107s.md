# GOP FREAKS OUT as Dem Intros IMPEACHMENT against Trump
**MeidasTouch:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY)
*  A Democratic Congress member from Detroit introduced a resolution for the impeachment [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=0.0s)]
*  of Donald Trump today on the House floor. This utterly pissed off the MAGA Republicans in the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=6.48s)]
*  House, and they tried to cut off the Democratic Congress member from even speaking. I want to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  show you what went down here as you have Democratic Congress member Shri Thanedar. He's a Congress [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=19.12s)]
*  member from Detroit. He's about to introduce this resolution for impeachment. Then MAGA Republican [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=26.56s)]
*  Representative Wilson says, stop talking, stop talking. I want to show you the introduction of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=32.8s)]
*  this resolution. Let me show you what happens when the MAGA Republicans try to interrupt first. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=38.16s)]
*  Let's play this clip. Department of Education as enacted in the Department of Education. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=43.84s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Michigan was recognized for one minute. He has substantially [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=51.04s)]
*  exceeded one minute with absurdities. Actually, the gentleman at this point had spoken for one [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=60.56s)]
*  minute, then was recognized subsequently to give notice under Rule 9 for a resolution. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=67.44s)]
*  So the gentleman has the floor for that purpose. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The gentleman from [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=72.64s)]
*  Michigan may continue. Then finally, Democratic Congress member Thanedar gets to introduce the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=76.64s)]
*  resolution. It's a pretty powerful resolution. Look, with the MAGA Republicans in control of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=83.36s)]
*  the House and the Senate, they're not going to pass any such resolution, but Donald Trump is [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=89.2s)]
*  engaging in high crimes and misdemeanors before our eyes. It's clear that that's happening every [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=95.68s)]
*  single day and frankly, multiple times a day. Donald Trump is committing crimes, whether it's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=101.52s)]
*  accepting bribes, whether it's defying Supreme Court orders. Donald Trump is a criminal. He's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=107.6s)]
*  always been. He's a felon. He's a sexual abuser. He is a fraud. He is a bankruptor. He is a utter [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=113.52s)]
*  embarrassment to the United States of America. So let me know what you think about the fact that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  Democratic Congress member Thanedar is introducing this resolution for impeachment. Obviously, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=125.28s)]
*  the MAGA Republicans are going to block it. But what do you think about him even introducing it? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=131.36s)]
*  Let me show you what went down. Play this clip. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to class 2A1 of rule 9, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=135.28s)]
*  I rise to give notice of my intention to raise a question of the privilege of the House. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=144.0s)]
*  Yes, and the gentleman will read the notice. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=152.08s)]
*  May I proceed? Yes, read the notice. Mr. Speaker, the form of the resolution is as follows. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=165.12s)]
*  House Resolution 353, Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States for High [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=175.92s)]
*  Crimes and Misdemeanors. Resolution, Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  for High Crimes and Misdemeanors. Resolved, that Donald John Trump, President of the United States, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=205.2s)]
*  is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors. And that the following articles of impeachment [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  be exhibited to the Senate. Article of impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  of the United States of America in the name of itself and of the people of the United States of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  America against Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America, in maintenance and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=242.08s)]
*  support of its impeachment against him for high crimes and misdemeanors. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  Article 1, Obstruction of Justice, Violation of Due Process, and a Breach of the Duty to Faithfully [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=260.24s)]
*  Execute Laws. The Constitution provides that the House of Representatives shall have the sole [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=271.84s)]
*  power of impeachment and that the President shall be removed from office on impeachment for [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=281.76s)]
*  and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. Further, Article 2 [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=291.52s)]
*  of the Constitution states that the President shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=304.56s)]
*  And by the way, here the congress member is talking about it even more, about what he's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  doing here, what he's after, what his goal is here. Here, play this clip. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=321.68s)]
*  This is Congressman Sri Thanedar. Donald Trump has already done real damage to our democracy, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  but defying a unanimous 9-0 Supreme Court ruling? That has to be the final straw. It's time we [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=333.76s)]
*  impeach Donald J. Trump. The court said the wrongfully deported Kilmer Garcia must be [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=341.36s)]
*  allowed to return and receive due process. Trump ignored it. He ignored the Constitution. He ignored [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=348.8s)]
*  the very checks and balances that keep our democracy intact. This isn't an isolated incident. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=356.64s)]
*  It's part of a dangerous deliberate pattern. That's why today I introduced a resolution [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=364.4s)]
*  to impeach Donald J. Trump outlining seven articles of impeachment. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=372.08s)]
*  Digestion, Brain Function, Energy Levels. That's why we love Just Thrive Probiotic. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=394.56s)]
*  Unlike other brands that make big promises but fall apart in your stomach, Just Thrive is the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=401.52s)]
*  only probiotic clinically proven to arrive in your gut 100% alive. For you, that means real results, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=406.96s)]

*  word for it. Try Just Thrive Probiotic for 90 days and see how much better you feel. If you don't [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=420.72s)]

*  leader right here, Hakeem Jeffries, and he's asked a question separately. The Trump DOJ, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=450.8s)]
*  which by the way, in my view, is a criminal cartel, let's call them what they are, let's use accurate [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=457.92s)]
*  words, they're trying to now potentially arrest Democratic Congress members in Newark the same way [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=462.56s)]
*  Trump's DOJ arrested the mayor of Newark for simply asking questions about this private prison, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=470.72s)]
*  Delaney Hall, with private prison guards paid for by tax dollars of We the People, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=480.4s)]
*  and the mayor of Newark saying, what the hell are you doing in my district? What are you doing in my [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=487.12s)]
*  city? Let me see what's going on here. I'm the mayor. Then they arrested him and they assaulted [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=490.88s)]
*  Democratic members of Congress, and now they're accusing the Democratic members of assaulting [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  the private prison guards because they're the Gestapo. I mean, they're like the brown shirts. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=500.56s)]
*  That's what the Trump DOJ has become. Here's what a Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=506.08s)]
*  has to say. Play this clip. Questions. Mr. Leader, good afternoon. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=511.68s)]
*  What would you, your statement the other day after there was this incident in Newark, you said they [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=518.64s)]
*  better not touch our members. Correct. What happens if they were to go and arrest these members or if [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=522.96s)]
*  they would try to sanction them during the House of Representatives? They'll find out. What would you [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=528.48s)]
*  do? They'll find out. I mean, what's the recourse? I mean, it does not broach a... They'll find out. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=532.08s)]
*  Doesn't that go across? That's a red line. What's the red line, though? I mean, I know we have... [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=536.24s)]
*  It's a red line. It's very clear. First of all, I think that the so-called Homeland Security [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=540.8000000000001s)]
*  spokesperson is a joke. It's a joke. They know better than to go down that road, and it's been made [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=547.84s)]
*  loudly and abundantly clear to the Trump administration. We're not going to be intimidated [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=557.76s)]
*  by their tactics to try to force [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=567.92s)]
*  principled opposition from not standing up to their extremism. It hasn't happened [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=574.56s)]
*  during the entirety of this failed term. It didn't happen when Donald Trump temporarily was sitting high [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=579.84s)]
*  in the immediate aftermath of the election. Do you think it's going to happen now [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=586.0s)]
*  when he's the most unpopular president in American history after his first 100 days? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=591.04s)]
*  Give me a break. No one's intimidated by this dude. No one. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=596.88s)]
*  And so there are clear lines that they just dare not cross. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=600.88s)]
*  And here's one of the propagandists of the regime angling to be the new pink dress lady [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=608.0s)]
*  after Caroline Levitt. Here she is, Tricia McLaughlin. She's been making a lot of appearances [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=615.2s)]
*  on Fox, again, just to make sure that she's not being used as a political commentator. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=621.52s)]
*  She's been making a lot of appearances on Fox, again, just an utter humiliating human being. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=627.5200000000001s)]
*  Let's watch what she has to say. Play this clip. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=632.5600000000001s)]
*  She's not fighting for American victims. And I'd like to lay out the facts. The fact that it was [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=634.72s)]
*  these three members of Congress who trespassed, broke the law, and stormed that ICE detention [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=638.5600000000001s)]
*  facility. They put law enforcement at risk. They put our detainees at risk, and they put our staff [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=644.0s)]
*  at risk. Had they asked for a tour, we would have happily facilitated one for them. But there was [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=649.0400000000001s)]
*  absolutely no notice. And the fact that they put hands, they body slammed, body rammed, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=654.0s)]
*  push, shove, whatever you want to call it. It was assault on our ICE agents, and it's unacceptable. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=658.96s)]
*  Now, folks, there was also a markup in the Energy and Commerce Committee today. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=664.08s)]
*  The markup is, again, to take away your Medicaid. The Energy and Commerce Committee [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=669.92s)]
*  is where markups around Medicaid take place, as we've reported here on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=675.2s)]
*  Under the new GOP tax bill, not the new one, the tax bill, they need to raise the debt ceiling by [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=681.28s)]
*  approximately $4 trillion or more, adding massive amounts of money, massive amounts to our deficit. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=689.12s)]
*  This is the least fiscally responsible thing. They're going to be giving trillions and trillions [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=698.1600000000001s)]
*  of dollars in tax cuts for the billionaires. And the plan right now is to cut your Medicaid. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=703.36s)]
*  That's clear. Get rid of Medicaid. You'll lose it under the current way the resolution [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=708.24s)]
*  is framed. There were protests that broke out today. Chaos in the House Hall in general. Play [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=712.8s)]
*  this clip. The chair, the committee will come to order. The chair, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=718.96s)]
*  the chair will advise the audience that disruption of a congressional business [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  is a violation of law and is a criminal offense. Please come to order. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=741.1999999999999s)]
*  The chair advises the audience that violations will not be tolerated [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=754.16s)]
*  and the violators will be removed from the room. It may be subject to arrest. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=757.9200000000001s)]
*  Now, it should also be noted too that MAGA Republican Congress members and senators, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=769.6s)]
*  you know, I even think that they're feeling a little uncomfortable. And these are cult members, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=775.6s)]
*  right? About the way Donald Trump is accepting bribes from Qatar and Middle East nations as [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=780.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is visiting them. For example, we have MAGA Republican Congress member from New York, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=786.56s)]
*  Mike Lawler, and here he's asked about the Trump regime accepting bribes from Qatar [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=792.4s)]
*  and what he feels about it. Let me show you what he has to say. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=798.88s)]
*  Look, let's face it, Hamas is based in Qatar. Okay. How do they explain that away? Hamas is [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=802.0s)]
*  based in Qatar. What about this plane? What are your thoughts on this jumbo jet that the Qataris [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=807.76s)]
*  want to give President Trump? Well, I'm still seeking to get more clarity and information on [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=812.8s)]
*  it. I think obviously from the president's standpoint, you know, he wants to be able to [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=820.16s)]
*  have a plane that meets the needs of him and his administration. But obviously we don't want to be [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=826.64s)]
*  straight up accepting any type of gift from any foreign government, certainly not, you know, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=835.52s)]
*  one that can be viewed in a way that obviously has been presented here. So a lot more information [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=843.68s)]
*  that I think needs to come out on it. Congressman, thank you so much. Good to see you. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=850.16s)]
*  Here's Magher Republican Senator Rand Paul asked about the bribes out in the open that Trump is [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=854.0s)]
*  accepting. Play this clip. On the jet, I do think the jet probably sends the wrong signal to people [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=859.36s)]
*  and I don't like the look or appearance of it. So I would hope that he would reject it. The [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=865.2s)]
*  constitution specifically says you can't take gifts from foreign leaders. It doesn't say you [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=869.52s)]
*  can't take gifts unless they're going to be for, you know, official use. We also do a lot of business [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=874.08s)]
*  with Qatar and so we sell them a lot of arms. Essentially the United States is the biggest arms [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=880.0s)]
*  merchant in the world. We sell arms everywhere and they're lucrative deals for the arms manufacturers, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=884.9599999999999s)]
*  but I have actually tried to hold up arms sales before to both Saudi Arabia and to Qatar because [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=891.1999999999999s)]
*  of their human rights records. So I don't know if we can have an honest appraisal of their human [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=896.0s)]
*  rights record and decisions on arm sales if we're receiving $400 million gifts from a country. So [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=901.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm not for it. And all these nations now want to get in on the bribe actions. If you tell Donald [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=907.52s)]
*  Trump we want to build a Trump Tower, he sacrifices American foreign policy and does whatever you want. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=913.04s)]
*  We saw this in Saudi Arabia earlier. Trump is now lifting the sanctions on Syria after Syria's new [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=919.52s)]
*  president pitches a Trump Tower in Damascus, literally before and after Syria's new president [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=926.8s)]
*  says we'll do Trump Tower Damascus. Trump announces he's lifting the sanctions on Syria. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=933.36s)]
*  Now corporate news can call all of this stuff out. Corporate news should be calling out Donald [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=938.72s)]
*  Trump's crimes. And by the way, I did other videos on this as well so I don't need to repeat it here. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=944.0s)]
*  I mean, but Donald Trump is clearly adult. He can't even speak in sentences. Can't speak in [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=948.48s)]
*  sentences. Like I show you these speeches that Donald Trump gives, right? He doesn't, it's word [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=953.84s)]
*  salad. It's word mush, you know, and he's criming every single day. But this tells you everything [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=959.92s)]
*  about our corporate news, right? What does our corporate news want to focus on right now? Of [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=966.3199999999999s)]
*  course, Joe Biden. It seems like every reporter wants to come out with a book right now acting [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=970.8s)]
*  like former president Biden was like mentally gone so that he couldn't even think and that like he [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=976.0s)]
*  needs like wheelchairs and like he like we saw him. We saw him. He was old. Yes, former president [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=984.48s)]
*  Biden, guess what? He was in his 80s. He was old. But you know what he was able to do? Speak in [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=990.72s)]
*  sentences, speak logically, have coherent policies, not declare trade wars against the world, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=995.84s)]
*  and then capitulate every time that there's pressure, tank the markets, manipulate the markets, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=1002.88s)]
*  accept bribes. There was a coherent policy. So y'all can just, you know, the media can focus on, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=1008.72s)]
*  oh, Biden, Biden's old. Okay, yeah, he was old. He was an old guy. Sure. Should there be younger [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=1014.64s)]
*  leadership? Is that the point you want to make? If that's what you want to say, then you know, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=1019.9200000000001s)]
*  you could say that versus being just overtly ageist. But this is what they're focusing on. I mean, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=1024.4s)]
*  Jake Tapper's out with, they're all out with books and they all promote each other's books. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=1029.84s)]
*  Biden aids discussed wheelchair use if he were reelected new books. He's here in New York. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=1034.08s)]
*  We see him. He's out getting pizza. He looks good. We saw him at Pope Francis's funeral. Look great. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=1040.8799999999999s)]
*  While Donald Trump was like drooling on himself. Like, could we just be real? Here's Biden. Let's [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=1048.8s)]
*  play this. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=1055.76s)]
*  That was, that's Biden today. On the other hand, we have Donald Trump saluting the Saudi military [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=1064.96s)]
*  as MBS is like with his heart. Thank you, Donald. Thank you, Donald. Well, I guess that's why we're [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNlNXhMybY&t=1072.1599999999999s)]
