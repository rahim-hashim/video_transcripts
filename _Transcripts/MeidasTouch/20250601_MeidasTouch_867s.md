# Trump has DERANGED Late Night MELTDOWN in PUBLIC
**MeidasTouch:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU)
*  At approximately 11 PM last night, Donald Trump was inexplicably posting that President Joe Biden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=0.0s)]
*  doesn't exist and that former president Biden was actually executed in 2020. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=7.84s)]
*  But former president Biden uses clones and body doubles and robotic engineered soulless mindless [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=13.68s)]
*  entities is what you see. And Democrats don't know the difference. Yes, the president of the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=20.72s)]
*  United States is making social media posts from his official account reposting QAnon messages [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=28.08s)]
*  that former president Biden doesn't really exist and he's using clones and doubles robotically [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=36.32s)]
*  engineered. Okay, that's what he's posting. We literally have the most demented lunatic psycho [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=42.8s)]
*  in charge of the United States and our nuclear codes last night. In addition to posting that, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=51.6s)]
*  he posts images like this. Trump was right about everything and it is him kissing the American flag [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=56.8s)]
*  and then he also posted in addition to saying that former president Biden is actually not real and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  is robotically engineered. He made a post saying that he was withdrawing the nomination of Jared [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=73.84s)]
*  Isaacman as the head of NASA. Now Jared Isaacman was the handpicked NASA head by Elon Musk. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=81.52s)]
*  Isaacman himself is a billionaire. He was an astronaut for SpaceX, a close friend of Elon Musk. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=90.8s)]
*  So at 3 15 PM yesterday, Elon Musk tweeted his support for Jared Isaacman and then shortly [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=98.16s)]
*  thereafter, Donald Trump officially dropped Isaacman as the NASA nominee. This is what was [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=105.68s)]
*  being reposted by Elon Musk. Jared Isaacman is the singular visionary capable of leading NASA into the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=113.28s)]
*  next frontier. He will accelerate our return to the moon against an international competitor's effort [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=119.84s)]
*  to beat us there and will set the groundwork for future exploration of Mars. Donald Trump then [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  writes, after a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=131.68s)]
*  nomination of Isaacman to head NASA. I will soon announce the new nominee who will be mission [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=136.8s)]
*  aligned and put America first in space. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I guess what [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=142.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is referring to that previously Isaacman had given some money to Democrats, but [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=147.6s)]
*  so did Donald Trump in the past. What this seems like is that as part of the feud that was bubbling [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  up between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, with Elon Musk now gone, Donald Trump making a point to fire [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=159.6s)]
*  Elon Musk's hand pick guy. A lot of right wing media people are furious and flipping out about [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=165.68s)]
*  this, whether it's Laura Loomer or Greg Kelly or all these people. They were saying, we really [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=171.68s)]
*  wanted Isaacman. You may recall our coverage of Jared Isaacman's hearing before the United States [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=177.44s)]
*  Senate to be the NASA head. We covered it here on the Midas Touch Network. The Democrats were [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=183.76s)]
*  asking him a pretty basic question like, was Elon Musk in the room with you when you were picked to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  be the head of NASA? What did you discuss with Elon Musk? Isaacman refused to answer the question. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=196.48s)]
*  Here, just play this clip. Let's watch it. Was Elon Musk in your meeting when Trump offered you the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=203.12s)]
*  NASA position at Mar-a-Lago? Senator, I was interviewed by the president of the United States. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  Was Elon Musk in the meeting when he offered you the job? Senator, my meeting was with the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=212.96s)]
*  president of the United States. So Elon Musk was not in the meeting. Senator, I was being interviewed [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=217.44s)]
*  and speaking with the president of the United States. You can just say he was not in the meeting. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  Was he in the meeting or not in the meeting? Senator, I'm trying to be as transparent as I [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=226.8s)]
*  can. I was being interviewed by the president of the United States. It's not a difficult question. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  Was Elon Musk in the room when the president offered you the job? Senator, I was again, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=235.84s)]
*  my meeting was with the president of the United States. I'm assuming that you don't want to answer [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=241.04s)]
*  the question directly because Elon Musk was in the room unless you wanted to spell us that notion. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=246.64s)]
*  Senator, again, I was being interviewed by the president of the United States. Now, folks, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=254.48s)]
*  the big headline from the Des Moines Register is, well, we are all going to die. That's what [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=257.76s)]
*  Magga Republican Senator Joni Ernst, the Iowa senator, had to say 48 hours ago yesterday. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=265.52s)]
*  She made a video of herself walking in a cemetery and she further mocked people and saying, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=273.28s)]
*  you're all going to die. You're all going to die. But if you want eternal salvation, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=280.64s)]
*  trust Jesus Christ. We're all going to die. That's the messaging from the Magga Republicans. Yes, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=286.32s)]
*  we're cutting your Medicaid. Yes, we're going to be getting rid of your social security and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=292.88s)]
*  your health care and we're attacking food stamps and all these programs, FEMA, but you're going to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=299.04s)]
*  die anyway. So die now. That's what's called a death cult. That's what's called a death cult. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  Here's what Joni Ernst said yesterday at the cemetery in another selfie video she made. Here, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=310.0s)]
*  play this clip. Hello, everyone. I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=315.52s)]
*  for a statement that I made yesterday at my town hall. See, I was in the process of answering a [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=323.04s)]
*  question that had been asked by an audience member when a woman who was extremely distraught [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=330.56s)]
*  screamed out from the back corner of the auditorium, people are going to die. And I [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=337.36s)]
*  made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=345.04s)]
*  we are all going to perish from this earth. So I apologize. And I'm really, really glad [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=354.64000000000004s)]
*  that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well. But for those that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=363.6s)]
*  would like to see eternal and everlasting life, I encourage you to embrace my Lord and Savior, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=371.04s)]
*  Jesus Christ. I want to show you this, though, because I thought it was very powerful. And I [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  think this is how you need to fight. Democratic governor from Minnesota, Tim Walz, saying it's [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  time we stop playing nice. We need to bully the shit out of Donald Trump. Bully the bully. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=398.8s)]
*  I called out on this because I called Donald Trump a wannabe dictator. It's because he is. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=399.52s)]
*  It's because he is. Oh, the governor's being mean and the governor's speaking out on that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=406.08s)]
*  Well, maybe it's time for us to be a little meaner. Maybe it's time for us to be a little more fierce. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=414.72s)]
*  Because we have to ferociously push back on this. And again, I'll speak to my teacher colleagues in [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=419.44s)]
*  here. The thing that bothers a teacher more than anything is to watch a bully, to watch this bully, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=429.2s)]
*  and to stop it. And when it's a child, you talk to them and you tell them why bullying is wrong. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=435.52s)]
*  But when it's adult like Donald Trump, you bully the shit out of him back. You push back. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=441.44s)]
*  You make sure they know it's not there. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=446.0s)]
*  Yeah, I thought that was a powerful moment indeed. Donald Trump looking fatigued and demented [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=450.4s)]
*  yesterday when he was getting off an airplane. He was saying a few things that I think are worth [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=457.84s)]
*  just kind of fact checking right here. Donald Trump saying that Japan wants to make a trade [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=463.84s)]
*  deal with the United States very badly. Here, play this clip. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=469.12s)]
*  Do you anticipate any trade deals next week at all? And does this deal today with Nippon [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=472.72s)]
*  sort of overall help your talks with Japan? Well, Japan very much wants to make a trade deal. I [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=477.44s)]
*  don't think this has much to do with it. But certainly, it certainly won't hurt because we [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=484.24s)]
*  have a very good relationship with Japan. But as you know, Japan is in there right now negotiating [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=489.84s)]
*  as we speak. And they want to very much make a deal. I think the deal... [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=494.96s)]
*  Okay, they want to make a trade deal so badly that it's been what, two months and they haven't [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=498.4s)]
*  made a deal because you've been very disrespectful, Donald, to Japan and to the Japanese people. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  You've lied about their economy and you've made it very difficult for them to have a deal. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=508.0s)]
*  Here, Donald Trump is asked about what deal he's most proud of. And then he makes up a fake deal [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=512.48s)]
*  that he didn't do. He said he's most proud of negotiating the ceasefire between India and [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=519.52s)]
*  Pakistan. And as you know from watching all of our videos on India, Donald Trump had nothing to [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=525.12s)]
*  do with the ceasefire. India's foreign minister said Donald Trump had nothing to do with the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=530.72s)]
*  ceasefire. And it's absolutely pissing off the people of India that Donald Trump keeps on saying [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=535.04s)]
*  this because he's making it sound like the people of India are weak and that they just want scraps [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=539.92s)]
*  of Donald Trump's dangling trade in front of them. And that that's why they had a ceasefire [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=546.72s)]
*  against Pakistan versus the fact that India is the fourth largest economy in the world in terms [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=552.88s)]
*  of countries and that it had a successful military operation. And that's why there was a ceasefire. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=558.64s)]
*  And Trump had nothing to do with it. But play the clip so you can hear what he says. Let's play it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=564.96s)]
*  They want to very much make a deal. I think the deal I'm most proud of is the fact that [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=568.88s)]
*  we're dealing with India, we're dealing with Pakistan, and we were able to stop potentially [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=573.28s)]
*  a nuclear war through trade as opposed to through bullets. You know, normally they do it through [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=578.16s)]
*  bullets. We do it through trade. So I'm very proud of that. Nobody talks about it, but we had a very [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=583.12s)]
*  nasty potential war going on between Pakistan and India. And now if you look, they're doing fine. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=589.76s)]
*  It was getting very bad. It was getting very nasty. They're both nuclear powers. The Pakistan [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=598.24s)]
*  representatives are coming in next week. And India, as you know, we're very close to making [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=604.96s)]
*  a deal with India. And I wouldn't have any interest in making a deal with either if they were going to [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=609.6s)]
*  be at war with each other. I would not. And I let them know. And then finally, Donald Trump here [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=616.64s)]
*  lies about the Nippon Steel acquisition of US Steel. Trump is asked, so is what's taking place [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=622.0s)]
*  an acquisition by Nippon Steel, the Japanese company of US Steel? And Trump goes, nope, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=630.4s)]
*  it's just an investment. It's controlled by the US. Here, play this clip. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=636.24s)]
*  I've been calling this out. I did a whole video about it yesterday. It's an acquisition. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=660.4s)]
*  Unless they're changing the entire deal that was previously blocked by former President Biden and [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=678.8s)]
*  that Republicans and Democrats alike were against from 2023, 2024. That was an acquisition [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=684.96s)]
*  where Nippon Steel acquires, becomes the controlling shareholder of US Steel and it becomes a wholly [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=692.56s)]
*  owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel. US Steel becomes Nippon Steel. It could still keep its name, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=699.84s)]
*  but it's Nippon Steel as a subsidiary. And these lies by Trump and MAGA, because they're trying [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=706.16s)]
*  to act like, oh, well, it's still controlled by the US. It isn't. So it's just one of the Trump [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=712.72s)]
*  frauds where he goes, he calls it something else. But the problem remains. It's like when [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=717.6800000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump says, don't test and you won't know how many cases you have. Well, people are still [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=723.28s)]
*  dying. Nippon Steel acquiring US Steel creates national security issues that have to be addressed [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjxrGFFxRJU&t=728.32s)]
