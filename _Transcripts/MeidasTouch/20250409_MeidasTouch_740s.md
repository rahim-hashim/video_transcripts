# TERRIFIED Trump FOLDS IN PANIC amid ECONOMIC COLLAPSE
**MeidasTouch:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4)
*  You started the morning saying, be cool. And just a few hours later, there was a pause put in on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=0.0s)]
*  terrace. Can you walk us through what you're thinking about, why you decided to put a 90-day [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=6.48s)]
*  pause? Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=12.24s)]
*  you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=18.88s)]
*  We've got some major breaking news. The headline, a panicked and terrified Donald Trump has folded [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=22.32s)]
*  on his tariff plans. In a major policy reversal, Trump announced a 90-day pause on his massive [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=27.84s)]
*  tariffs after he sparked an economic crash globally. My name is Brett Mycelis with the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=34.0s)]
*  Midas Touch Network. Remember to hit subscribe now and add the Midas Touch podcast on Apple [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=39.2s)]
*  podcasts and Spotify. Stocks were collapsing, the bond market imploding, the 10-year treasury [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=43.28s)]
*  yield was skyrocketing, indicating that mortgage rates and other loans were about to skyrocket. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  So naturally, Donald Trump did what he does best. He caved. Effective immediately, all of the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=54.0s)]
*  tariffs will be capped at 10% for the duration of a 90-day period with those additional higher [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=59.6s)]
*  tariffs being paused. The only exception is China, which will now face a dramatically increased [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  tariff rate of 125%. So I want to be extra clear here just for a second. Trump has still put a 10% [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=69.68s)]
*  tax on virtually everything Americans will buy. Costs for businesses will still be higher. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=76.16s)]
*  Prices for Americans will still be higher. Trump announced the pause on his Truth Social website, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=80.88s)]
*  writing the following, quote, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=85.28s)]
*  Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the world's markets, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=86.56s)]
*  I am hereby raising the tariff charged to China by the United States of America [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=90.24s)]
*  to 125% effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  China will realize that the days of ripping off the USA and other countries is no longer sustainable [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=99.52s)]
*  or acceptable. It's always projection with this guy, right? Let me continue. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 countries have called representatives [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=108.24s)]
*  of the United States, including the departments of commerce, treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=112.24s)]
*  solution to the subjects being discussed relative to trade, trade barriers, tariffs, currency, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=116.96s)]
*  manipulation, and non-monetary tariffs, and that the countries have not, at my strong suggestion, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=121.52s)]
*  retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90-day pause [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=126.0s)]
*  and a substantially lower reciprocal tariff during this period of 10%, also effective immediately. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=131.12s)]
*  Thank you for your attention to this matter. So, yes, we are seeing this popular meme play [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=137.28s)]
*  out again in real time. Trump makes a stupid decision. Something really bad happens. He [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=143.28s)]
*  convinces his followers the problem is now magically solved, and he then reverses his [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=148.8s)]
*  stupid decision, and the cycle repeats and repeats and repeats. It should be noted that Trump this [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=153.04s)]
*  morning encouraged his followers to buy stock, writing just hours before he made the announcement, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=158.8s)]
*  This is a great time to buy DJT. Naturally, once Trump made the announcement, the markets had a [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=164.16s)]
*  massive jump. Market manipulation, anyone? The Trump propagandists kicked right into gear, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=170.4s)]
*  calling this panicked reversal the art of the deal and pretending that Trump was not reacting [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=175.6s)]
*  to crashing the global economy and US bond markets. Trump's chief propagandist, Caroline Levitt, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=180.64s)]
*  was one of those people calling this the art of the deal. Listen to this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=186.16s)]
*  Excuse me. Excuse me, recall if I could just add to what the secretary said, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=190.16s)]
*  many of you in the media clearly missed the art of the deal. You clearly failed to see what [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=194.0s)]
*  President Trump is doing here. You tried to say that the rest of the world would be moved [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=199.6s)]
*  closer to China when in fact we've seen the opposite effect. The entire world is calling [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=204.4s)]
*  the United States of America, not China, because they need our markets. They need our consumers, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=208.88s)]
*  and they need this president in the Oval Office to talk to them. And that's exactly why more than [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=213.68s)]
*  75 countries have called because the United States of America is the best place in the world [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=218.24s)]
*  to do business. And as the president has shown great courage, as the secretary has said, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=222.72s)]
*  in choosing to retaliate against China even higher, Elena, go ahead. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  It's so embarrassing. She literally did this meme. Trump goes, I'm adding the tariffs. His [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=230.8s)]
*  followers go, this will create jobs. Trump says he's removing tariffs. His followers go, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  this is the art of the deal. And the cycle repeats. And if you're not feeling the second [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=240.72s)]
*  hand embarrassment enough just yet, well, let me show you this clip of Benny Johnson. This was [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=245.2s)]
*  put together at Project Liberal. And in the first clip, you'll see Benny Johnson, a MAGA talking [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  head who is literally being paid by Russia to spread pro-Trump propaganda, talking about the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=254.48s)]
*  economic crash occurring under Donald Trump. He was telling his listeners that these are just [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=259.2s)]
*  numbers. Everyone loses money. It builds character. But in 2024, when Joe Biden was president and the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=263.76s)]
*  stock market was down for a single day, he called it the Kamala crash and he treated it like the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=269.68s)]
*  apocalypse. Watch this. Losing money costs you nothing. This is just the reality of life. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=274.72s)]
*  Were you young and dumb? How much money did you lose? Everyone loses money. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=281.6s)]
*  Everyone loses money. It costs you nothing. In fact, it builds quite a bit of character. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  In fact, you learn a lot of lessons actually by losing money. It's bloody, bloody, bloody, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=289.04s)]
*  bloody Black Monday. Holy moly. The Kamala crash is here. Kamala needs to get in front of a camera [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=293.6s)]
*  today. People are losing their homes today. People are losing their fortunes today. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=303.36s)]
*  People are losing their futures today. People are losing their 401ks today. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  This is shaping up to be one of the worst market days in American history. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=311.2s)]
*  We've got a lot more to report. I'll be right back after this. Let's be real. Coffee isn't just a [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=316.56s)]
*  drink. It's a ritual, a lifeline, the bridge between half asleep and ready to conquer the day. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=320.88s)]
*  And if it's that essential, why settle for anything less than extraordinary? That's where [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=325.68s)]
*  trade comes in. Listen, you know I take my coffee seriously. And every single bag of coffee I've [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=330.08s)]
*  received from trade has been next level. Trade is not just a subscription. It's like having a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=335.12s)]
*  personal barista who actually knows what you like. You just take their quiz and in under a minute, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=339.76s)]
*  they'll match you with your perfect coffee. And if your first bag isn't a hit, they'll replace [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=344.24s)]
*  it for free until they get it right. I love that. Trade is the number one US coffee destination [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  working with over 50 of the best roasters around the country. You're getting top quality coffee [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=353.2s)]
*  roasted to order while supporting local businesses. That's a win win. Just this week, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=358.24s)]
*  I got a bag of Ethiopian coffee from a roaster called Necessary Coffee that's based in Pennsylvania. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=363.6s)]
*  And it was just incredible. And I love that I never have to worry about taking an emergency run [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  to the grocery store for a mediocre overpriced bag because trade delivers top-notch coffee [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=373.04s)]
*  straight to my door. Right now, trade is exclusively offering our listeners 50% off [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=378.64s)]
*  your one month trial at drinktrade.com slash Midas. That's drinktrade, T-R-A-D-E, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  dot com slash Midas, M-E-I-D-A-S, for 50% off your one month trial. Trust me, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=391.44s)]
*  you will never go back to grocery store coffee. If you remember, just yesterday, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=398.56s)]
*  Donald Trump was calling any Republican who suggested even pausing the tariffs weak and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  panicans. So I guess this makes Donald Trump weak and a panicant. And by the way, if tariffs [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=407.44s)]
*  are supposed to make us so rich and strong and be the quote medicine that we all needed, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=413.04s)]
*  then why would he pause them? Can a single Trump supporter answer that for me? Huh? Crickets? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=418.24s)]
*  Thought so. Let's pull up some receipts. Here was Trump on April 7th saying that he was not looking [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  into a pause. Mr. President, would you be open to a pause in tariffs to allow for negotiations? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=431.04s)]
*  Well, we're not looking at that. Here was Caroline Levin on April 8th saying that no delay was being [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=441.12s)]
*  considered. Elena. Hi, guys. It's clear the president has found the world's attention with [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=446.32s)]
*  these tariffs. Is there, is he considering at all potentially holding off on imposing some of them [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=451.76000000000005s)]
*  before the deadline or maybe later, you know, reversing them because he's having these [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=458.48s)]
*  negotiations and having these good talks with other leaders? The president was asked and answered [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=463.04s)]
*  this yesterday. He said he's not considering an extension or delay. I spoke to him before this [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=467.76s)]
*  briefing. That was not his mindset. He expects that these tariffs are going to go into effect. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=472.4s)]
*  And you said something very important, Elena, in your question. You said the president has [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=477.44s)]
*  captivated the attention of the world. Absolutely. He has, and it's about time we have a president [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=481.28s)]
*  in the Oval Office who is putting the world on notice and is putting the American people first. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=486.32s)]
*  And again, is using the leverage of the United States to negotiate good trade. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=491.12s)]
*  And just two days ago, Caroline Levitt told the press that the idea that Trump was even considering [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=495.76s)]
*  a pause was quote fake news. Watch this. I spoke to Caroline Levitt, the white house [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=500.08s)]
*  press secretary on the phone, uh, just a short time ago. And she tells me it is quote unquote [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  fake news that the white house is considering a 90 day pause. So the white house pouring cold [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=509.28s)]
*  water on this idea, wherever it came from. Trump's treasury secretary, Scott Besson to said, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=514.64s)]
*  he hasn't been included in like any of these tariff decisions is now saying that this was all [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  part of the plan and that Trump actually go to China into a bad position. Watch this. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=523.76s)]
*  All this was again, this was driven by the president's strategy. He and I had a long talk [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=528.88s)]
*  on Sunday and this was his strategy all along. And that, you know, you might even say that he [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=534.64s)]
*  go to China into a bad position. They, they responded, they have shown themselves to the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=541.52s)]
*  world to be the bad actors. And we are willing to cooperate with our allies and with our trading [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=549.04s)]
*  partners who did not retaliate. It wasn't a hard message. Don't retaliate. Things will turn out [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=556.56s)]
*  well. This is just typical loser and abuser behavior. You try to punish somebody, they react [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=562.64s)]
*  to protect themselves, and then you try to punish them more and blame them saying that they were [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=568.16s)]
*  asking for it. Just, it's so disgraceful, this whole thing. Oh, and by the way, speaking of China, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=572.8s)]
*  Fox is now reporting that any tick tock deal with China is now off the table. Watch this. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=577.6s)]
*  Varro was talking as of yesterday about not taking the win. And now they did. And it's all because [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=582.32s)]
*  of the bond market. I want to point out one other thing because of China, there will not be a tick [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=587.6800000000001s)]
*  tock deal. Okay. That the white house has confirmed to me that is basically off the table. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=591.84s)]
*  As Roger Sullenberger of the daily beast writes, quote, the volatility of Trump's presidency seem [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  like it may function as its own kind of non-monetary tariff, eroding trade relationships [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=601.0400000000001s)]
*  without generating the additional tax revenue. And that really is the issue. I mean, Trump has [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=605.52s)]
*  lost complete control of the tariff narrative. He has proven himself to be an erratic and [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=609.92s)]
*  untrustworthy trade partner, an abuser of the global economic system. He offers no stability [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=614.48s)]
*  businesses or governments under his leadership. There is no reason for our allies or our rivals [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=619.36s)]
*  to place any faith in the consistency of us policy. And for American businesses, the uncertainty has [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=625.04s)]
*  to be paralyzing. How can a company justify sinking billions into building factories in [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=630.56s)]
*  the United States? If those investments could instantly be undercut by a single tweet, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=636.7199999999999s)]
*  Trump could raise tariffs, lower them, scrap them entirely at a whim, obliterating an entire [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=642.4s)]
*  business model overnight. There's no strategy here, no coherence, only chaos. And we all suffer [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=647.1199999999999s)]
*  because of it. As Midas touch editor in chief Ron Filipkowski says, quote, the credibility of the [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=654.0s)]
*  U S government is completely shot, gone, annihilated. Nobody anywhere in the world can believe a single [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=659.12s)]
*  word that comes out of this administration ever. Oh, and here's a photo that the Democrats on the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=665.36s)]
*  house and ways committee posted. Um, Trump's trade representative ambassador Greer was in the middle [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=670.32s)]
*  of testifying to Congress about why Trump's tariffs were so great and should never be paused. And at [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=675.04s)]
*  this very moment in the picture that I'm showing right now, he found out that Trump reversed the [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=680.24s)]
*  policy for those listening. He's staring down at his phone in disappointment and confusion after [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=684.4s)]
*  hours and hours of testimony. The ways and means Democrats tweeted the following along with this [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=689.4399999999999s)]
*  image heartbreaking man discovers he has to backpedal on a policy he just spent over four [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=694.0799999999999s)]
*  hours defending. Ouch. So there you have it. Trump caved again, the propagandists they're out in full [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=699.52s)]
*  force to try to spin this. Our alliances are shattered and Americans are worse off because [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=706.56s)]
*  of Donald Trump's erratic behavior. We're going to continue to follow this and all the news. So [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0jyALqQH4&t=712.32s)]
