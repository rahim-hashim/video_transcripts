# Trump gets SHAMED in front of ENTIRE WORLD and SHRIVELS
**MeidasTouch:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs)
*  I have a serious question, Donald. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=0.0s)]
*  For just one day, can you act like an adult? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=2.86s)]
*  Can you be normal? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=6.7s)]
*  I know the answer is no. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=8.46s)]
*  Donnie NoDeals does it again, humiliating the United States when he was in Rome for [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=10.58s)]
*  Pope Francis' funeral. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=17.14s)]
*  A cardinal who was even giving a speech called Donald Trump out for building walls instead [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  of bridges. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=25.5s)]
*  How do you get called out at a funeral of a pope? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=26.98s)]
*  If your name is Donald Trump, that's how. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=31.6s)]
*  He shows up yesterday wearing a blue suit. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=34.28s)]
*  Look, everybody around him follows the dress code, but Donald Trump wears a blue suit. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=37.8s)]
*  You're supposed to wear a black suit with a long black tie. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  That's the dress code. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=47.8s)]
*  Then Donald Trump falls asleep during the proceedings, during the ceremony. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=48.88s)]
*  You know who didn't fall asleep and you know who followed the dress code? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=55.24s)]
*  Former President Biden did. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=59.4s)]
*  You see him right there following the dress code. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=60.84s)]
*  What do you think Melania was praying for here? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=64.52s)]
*  What do you think she was thinking here? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=67.16s)]
*  So then Donald Trump was outside and then French President Emmanuel Macron and Prime [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=69.64s)]
*  Minister Kier Stalmer, they were with President Zelensky. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=77.16s)]
*  Watch this moment here where Macron shakes one hand, notably when Donald Trump puts his [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=80.72s)]
*  hand out. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=87.48s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron did not have any time for it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=88.6s)]
*  President Emmanuel Macron like, let's get real Donald, I'm not doing the stupid handshake. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=92.0s)]
*  On the domestic front, Donald Trump's approval is plummeting to the lowest in presidential [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=97.44s)]
*  history out of every single president ever. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=104.88s)]
*  Donald Trump's approval rating, at least modern polling, the lowest and it's getting [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=108.4s)]
*  lower. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=113.2s)]
*  We talked about a bunch of polls yesterday, like the Pew Research poll where Trump was [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=114.36s)]
*  polling at 40% approval, but on the economy he was at like 37%. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=119.28s)]
*  Similar results from the Fox poll, from the Reuters Ipsos poll. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=125.28s)]
*  While the new Associated Press Nork poll just came out, Donald Trump's approval below 40% [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=130.48s)]
*  on this one, 39% approval. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=137.88s)]
*  And then when you go into the various issues like on immigration, you only, you know, Donald [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=142.12s)]
*  Trump has real big issues on the economy, very small amount of people approve. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  Trade negotiations, like what is it, only 37% approve. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=155.0s)]
*  This is bad, bad news for Donald. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=160.54s)]
*  Bad, bad data. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=163.92s)]
*  And folks, when you see what Donald Trump's doing on the international stage, humiliating [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=166.48s)]
*  the United States and on the domestic front, I mean, of course his approval is going to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  be plummeting right now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=176.56s)]
*  People are pissed. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=178.0s)]
*  I mean, take a look at headlines like this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=179.0s)]

*  Two families, among them three US citizens, aged two, four, and seven, were abruptly deported [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=192.6s)]
*  under troubling circumstances, says the ACLU of Louisiana. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=200.2s)]
*  And also a Trump-appointed judge, federal judge in Louisiana, called Trump out as well [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=205.64s)]
*  for sending a two-year-old United States citizen, deported the little baby to Honduras when [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  his dad was petitioning, do not deport my son. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=221.3s)]
*  This from the Washington Post. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=226.66000000000003s)]
*  Three US citizen children from two different families were deported with their mothers [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=228.82000000000002s)]
*  by immigration and customs enforcement during the early hours of Friday morning. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=234.02s)]
*  One of them is a four-year-old with stage four cancer who was deported without medication [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=239.28s)]
*  or the ability to contact their doctors, the family's lawyer said. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=244.86s)]
*  How horrific can you get? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=250.34s)]
*  Apollo, not known for being a left-wing organization, Apollo, a private equity group that votes [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=253.26s)]
*  Republican or usually pushes Republican candidates. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=263.82s)]
*  Their latest report talks about US consumer sentiment collapsing. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=267.38s)]
*  The University of Michigan consumer expectations report has consumer expectations basically [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=272.74s)]
*  the lowest ever. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=281.04s)]
*  We're talking about Great Depression levels of low consumer expectation, US tourism collapsing, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  freight levels, trucking levels collapsing, cost pressures up. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=291.66s)]
*  Look at this map right here, which shows vessels leaving the port or not leaving the port of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=296.3s)]
*  China and you can see the kind of that fluorescent color right there by China. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=303.54s)]
*  That represents all of these ships that are not leaving the ports to come to the United [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=309.46000000000004s)]
*  States with goods. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=314.52000000000004s)]
*  There's usually about a 14-day to 21-day lag time. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=316.66s)]
*  If you're following freight volumes, trucking volumes right now, there's major problems [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=321.3s)]
*  ahead and we're going to be heading into a situation of scarcity where products that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=328.3s)]
*  are supposed to reach the United States are not reaching the United States. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=333.22s)]
*  Some more stories I want to share with you along those lines, Amazon sellers hiking their [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=338.3s)]
*  prices on hundreds of goods. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=344.34000000000003s)]
*  You're probably seeing that if you're buying those goods right there. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=346.38s)]
*  The Tesla protests, I want to give a shout out to them, still going strong even with [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=351.1s)]
*  Tesla just absolutely getting crushed right now because of the behavior of Elon Musk. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=356.06s)]
*  That is not deterring any of the Tesla protesters. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=362.86s)]
*  They show up every weekend with their signs like this right here. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=366.04s)]
*  The dominoes are already falling. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=370.70000000000005s)]
*  Donnie protests are working. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=373.18s)]
*  That's why we're proud here at the Midas Touch Network to highlight the protests, to work [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=376.08000000000004s)]
*  with groups like 5051 to share their protests. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=380.98s)]
*  Indivisible other groups highlight their protests. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=386.26s)]
*  It is a major, major priority of ours. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=389.3s)]
*  I want to share this with you as well. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=393.42s)]
*  Donald Trump talking about how it was in jest, he says, that he was saying that there would [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=395.66s)]
*  be peace in Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=403.02000000000004s)]
*  He said it was one big joke and that no one should have taken him seriously at all when [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=405.98s)]
*  he said there was going to be peace in Ukraine. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=413.18s)]
*  He said that that was it was fake news if you thought he was being serious. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=416.28s)]
*  Just so you can see, let me share with you what it is that Trump said here, play this [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=420.54s)]
*  clip. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=424.46s)]
*  End the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=425.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=427.26s)]
*  How would you do that? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=428.26s)]
*  I know Zelensky very well. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=429.26s)]
*  I'll end that war between those two countries in 24 hours. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=431.14s)]
*  It won't even take that long. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=436.3s)]
*  I will get the war ended. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=438.62s)]
*  I'll stop all of those lives from being wasted and lost. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=440.26s)]
*  And there'll be no more bombing of Ukraine. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=445.9s)]
*  There'll be no more bombing of Russia. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=448.97999999999996s)]
*  And everybody will be happy. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=451.62s)]
*  It can be negotiated, I think, within 24 hours. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=453.46s)]
*  It really has to be done from the office of the president. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=457.46s)]
*  And you have to get them both in a room. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=462.14s)]
*  And there are things you can say to each one of them, which I won't reveal now, which will [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=463.53999999999996s)]
*  guarantee that this war will end immediately. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=468.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that doesn't sound like someone who is joking right there at all. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=471.18s)]
*  I want to read this for you as well. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=476.53999999999996s)]
*  This is what Donald Trump posted yesterday. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=478.29999999999995s)]
*  So one of his posts yesterday after meeting with Zelensky, Donald Trump's post was, well, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=480.65999999999997s)]
*  I actually don't think that Putin may want peace at this point. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=487.22s)]
*  I think that Putin may not be interested in peace, really. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=493.06s)]
*  It took you that long, Donald, to come to that conclusion. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=497.1s)]
*  By the way, there have been zero deals so far in the 15 or 16 days since Donald Trump [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=501.14000000000004s)]
*  said there would be 90 deals in 90 days. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=506.5s)]
*  And here's what Trump's posting as well. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=509.28000000000003s)]
*  American ships, both military and commercial, should be allowed to travel free of charge [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=511.58s)]
*  through the Panama and Suez canals. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=517.8199999999999s)]
*  Those canals would not exist without the United States of America. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=520.5799999999999s)]
*  I've asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to immediately take care of and memorialize [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=524.18s)]
*  this situation. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=530.04s)]
*  So from Donald Trump, it's basically just moving on to now threatening more people. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=531.9s)]
*  You know, who's going to huff, he's going to puff and he's going to blow your house [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=538.82s)]
*  down. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=541.62s)]
*  But at this point, everybody knows, you know, when it comes to Donald, he threatens, he [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzrNy9XB5Gs&t=542.7s)]
