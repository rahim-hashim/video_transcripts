# Fox News LOSES CONTROL on LIVE TV as Trump GETS WORSE
**MeidasTouch:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I)
*  Another day of state regime media known as Fox just in total panic mode trying to justify [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's dangerous, destructive, and dastardly behavior, Treasury Secretary Scott [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=6.4s)]
*  Besant was on the Laura Ingraham show last night, and he addresses what Donald Trump said about why [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=12.72s)]
*  little girls should only have two dolls and five pencils and they should pay more for it, and you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=18.72s)]
*  should stop complaining if you want more dolls, little girls. Here's what Treasury Secretary [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=24.48s)]
*  Scott Besant says, let's play this clip. The other thing too is this reporter behind me was quite [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=29.6s)]
*  snarky the other day when President Trump talked about the girl having two dolls and he said, well [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=35.6s)]
*  what, the president didn't take the question, but he said what would you tell that girl? I said I [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=42.72s)]
*  would tell that young girl that you will have a better life than your parents, that you and your [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=47.28s)]
*  family, thanks to President Trump, can now be confident again that you will have a better life [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  than your parents, which working class Americans had abandoned that idea, your family will own a [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=58.08s)]
*  home, you will be able to advance, you will have a good education, you will have economic freedom, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=62.8s)]
*  that's what we are advancing. So you go from Treasury Secretary Scott Besant talking about [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=70.24s)]
*  how little girls should stop whining about only getting two dolls, governments doing central [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=76.48s)]
*  planning to Jesse Waters, one of the hosts on state regime media known as Fox, talking about [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=81.84s)]
*  an issue that's very pressing to him, that men should never cross their legs, he says, play this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  clip. Men should never cross their legs. What's worse, crossing your legs or leaning in? Text me. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=93.36s)]
*  I mean again, it's just a total clown show on Fox, no offense to clowns. These are fascist clowns. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=100.0s)]
*  Going back to Laura Ingraham right here with Treasury Secretary Scott Besant on, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  asked about empty ships coming from China, Treasury Secretary Scott Besant says, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=109.44s)]
*  that's not a big deal. All American companies prepared for this. They knew we were going to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=115.2s)]
*  do this. Here, play this clip. Christmas time is coming. There's going to be no toys for children. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=119.44s)]
*  Trump is Grinch and you all are going to get blamed for this. Was the political pressure [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=124.64s)]
*  and the consumer pressure building to an extent that critics are saying forced your hand? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=130.0s)]
*  Again, Laura, that I think a lot of American businesses have pre-positioned a lot of inventory. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=137.36s)]
*  The trade deficit actually jumped because so many people bought in advance and the companies that [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=144.96s)]
*  I've talked to have done that. So we are going to stick to our guns. But again, the U.S. and China [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=151.84s)]
*  have shared interest. They are the deficit country though. They sell us about four times more than we [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=160.0s)]
*  sell them. So it would be felt harder in China. What about small and medium sized businesses [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=166.16000000000003s)]
*  that aren't at your secret gatherings where you manipulate the markets? What about the people [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=173.84s)]
*  who employ 80% of Americans who are now just getting absolutely screwed? How about Main Street, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=179.84s)]
*  their Treasury Secretary Scott Besant? Oh, that's right. You don't give up about us. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  Jesse Waters talking about a major rule that he says was broken the other day. Here, play this clip. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Even know what he's talking about. What are they even talking about on this God forsaken network? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=213.44000000000003s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besant says it's all going to plan. Donald Trump is doing strategic [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=219.84s)]
*  uncertainty. That's what this is. Strategic uncertainty. What's he going to do? Is he going [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=227.12s)]
*  to wake up and post AI images of himself as the Pope? Or maybe he'll talk about Alcatraz. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=232.08s)]
*  Who knows? Maybe he'll tariff movies produced overseas. 145% tariffs, maybe 500% tariffs, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  maybe a bajillion percent tariffs. Strategic uncertainty. That's what intelligent people do [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=248.0s)]
*  here. Play this clip. That's okay. He's fine with no deal. So that I like that personally. I think [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=253.44s)]
*  it's great and brilliant. But Wall Street, your old friends hate it. They hate that kind of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=260.08s)]
*  uncertainty. What do you say to them tonight? Given President Trump's comments about, well, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=265.92s)]
*  we don't have a deal. We don't have a deal. We'll survive. Well, Laura, it's called in game theory, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=271.28s)]
*  it's called strategic uncertainty. What you're talking about. Nobody does it better than [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=275.2s)]
*  President Trump. And it can be unsettling for the markets. But why? Why are they unsettled? Because [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=278.96s)]
*  they have a lack of information. You know, I have President Trump has asymmetric information for what [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=286.32s)]
*  he's willing to do. We don't disclose it. And again, with President Trump, that the strategic [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=292.64s)]
*  uncertainty will make sure that we get the best deal possible. That's what's happening. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  What are they talking about? By the way, isn't it just very clear to you that Donald Trump doesn't [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=304.08s)]
*  have the most basic understanding of even like what a tariff is? What a trade deficit is? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=308.56s)]
*  Donald Trump thinks if there's a trade deficit, that means that we're subsidizing another country. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=315.84s)]
*  Donald Trump thinks it means that if there's a trade deficit, that means that other countries [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  are stealing our money. By the way, the trade deficit under Trump's tariff for against the world [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=328.08s)]
*  has gone up significantly. The trade deficit is up massively under Donald Trump. Why? Because [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  there are so many countries that are trying to import stuff because of how unpredictable [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=343.68s)]
*  Donald Trump is get the stuff here. And so it's actually adding to the deficit. But I guess they [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=348.64s)]
*  think that's a win. So then you have transportation secretary Sean Duffy, who got famous on the real [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=353.6s)]
*  world reality TV show on MTV. But then he was on the real world road rules challenge as well. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=361.04s)]
*  That's how he rode that to fame in the MAGA Republican party. And here he talks about he's [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  really upset right now at the Trump Department of Defense because they keep flying helicopters [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  with VIPs over Washington, D.C. And they're making the airspace very dangerous. And Pete [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=381.6s)]
*  Hegseth is refusing to respond to transportation secretary Sean Duffy. And he's like, I'm very [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=388.88s)]
*  frightened. I'm concerned. You're frightened and concerned. You're the freaking transportation [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=397.12s)]
*  secretary. Here, play this clip. There was this issue about an army helicopter in the D.C. flight [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  area and who was flying on it and why it flew in a pattern that forced two commercial airlines [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=408.0s)]
*  to have to reroute and land in another place. Were you able to find out who was who was on that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=415.2s)]
*  flight and why, given what happened with the 67 people whose lives were lost in a similar situation, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=420.88s)]
*  why would that even be happening? So there are way too many VIPs is what they call them at the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=427.44s)]
*  Pentagon. I mean, I look around the White House. There was a lot of really important people here. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=434.16s)]
*  They take a suburban. Why is the Pentagon that much more sophisticated? They have to take [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=437.68s)]
*  Helos helicopters in a really busy airspace. So I'm hoping that we're going to get the answers, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=442.88s)]
*  but I'm going to know who was on that flight because our Pentagon folks say that it was a [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=447.36s)]
*  training mission, not a VIP. What do you say? So but here's the thing. Training missions oftentimes, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=451.52s)]
*  if you ever go to a football game and you have a flyover with F-16s, guess what that's called? A [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=457.76s)]
*  training mission. So are we moving VIPs and calling it training missions? And how many training [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=463.12s)]
*  missions are you doing in the middle of the day? If you had a train train at a time where we don't [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=468.32s)]
*  have a busy airspace at DC, I thought that lesson was learned, you know, back on the 29th of January. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=471.52s)]
*  You don't have any answer from the Pentagon from last night to today. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=477.04s)]
*  But everybody, it's good to know that Sean Duffy has a hashtag Latino wife. He wants you all to [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=480.56s)]
*  know that he does. OK, hashtag Latino wife heart, woman dancing. And he goes nice to come home on a [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=487.68s)]
*  Friday night to home cooked steak tacos after a long week working at the DOT exclamation point, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=496.0s)]
*  hashtag Latino wife. What is wrong with these people? Did you know Fast Growing Trees is the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=504.0s)]

*  but I'll show it to you now. Earlier in the day yesterday, Treasury Secretary Scott Vesson [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=613.52s)]
*  testified under oath before Congress. He was asked the most basic question, who pays for tariffs? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=619.04s)]
*  Who pays for tariffs? The answer is people. We pay for it. The importer pays the tariff, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=626.0s)]
*  right? They pay the levy and it gets passed on to the consumer in the form of basically a tax. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=634.72s)]
*  That's how it works. It's not China who pays it. They don't eat it. It's them eating it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=640.96s)]
*  Watch Treasury Secretary Scott Vesson's response play. Who pays tariffs, Mr. Secretary? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=647.36s)]
*  No, no, no. Ask the answer to the questions I asked, please. I only have five minutes. Who pays [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=656.0s)]
*  tariffs? Sorry? Who pays tariffs, Mr. Secretary? Please. The question is very simply, who pays [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=661.76s)]
*  tariffs, Mr. Chairman? I'd like him to answer that question. He wants to answer other questions. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=667.84s)]
*  Well, Congressman, if the exporters dislike tariffs so much, why wouldn't they? If [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=672.32s)]
*  I think what you're trying to get me to say, did you remember the question? I'm not sure you did. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=686.0s)]

*  go. Mr. Secretary, reclaiming the guy couldn't even put a sentence together in one of the most [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=706.8s)]
*  basic of questions right there. Then you have the border czar, Tom Homan, who's a creepy, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=714.4s)]
*  creepy man. He's obsessed with AOC and like arresting AOC and this weirdo border czar guy, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=722.72s)]
*  Tom Homan, he goes on Fox and he's like, I'm going to arrest her. We're going to put, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=731.36s)]
*  we're going to arrest her. We're going to... Oh my God. You're giving Barney Rubble a bad name. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=736.4s)]

*  going to threaten to refer me to DOJ because I'm using my free speech rights in order to advise [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=748.8000000000001s)]

*  her mind rent free every day, but we all know exactly what she's doing. Like I just said, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=771.28s)]
*  she's educating the worst of the worst, how to invade law enforcement, but the tables have now [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  turned. She's educating people how to get prosecuted because you have a final order. It is illegal [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=780.88s)]
*  to not comply with that order. It's a crime to take steps to [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=788.9599999999999s)]
*  not comply with ICE removal orders or not comply with ICE actions taken in custody. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=796.48s)]
*  You can't hinder your own removal that was ordered by the federal judge. I would like AOC to read [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=801.2s)]

*  wants to do business in America, Sean. Everyone wants to do business here. Low regs, low taxes, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=823.6800000000001s)]
*  cheap energy, and a winning president. Everyone wants to do business now in America, Sean. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=829.28s)]
*  Yeah, I don't really think so anymore. You've like literally destroyed the brand of America. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=834.3199999999999s)]
*  Don't take my word for it. I mean, you have the top hedge fund, top private equity people say the [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=839.8399999999999s)]

*  saying that what Donald Trump did in the Oval with Prime Minister Mark Carney was brilliant. He was a [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=850.24s)]
*  chess master. Trump was a chess master there. Play this clip. Well, first of all, I had the pleasure [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=857.6s)]
*  of getting to be at the meeting today between the president of the United States and the prime [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=864.8000000000001s)]
*  minister of Canada. What I witnessed was like watching a grand master in chess perform. Okay. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=870.88s)]
*  Let's look at Prime Minister Carney's face. Now, you call them a chess master. As Donald Trump says [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=879.12s)]
*  that America does not do that much business with Canada. Canada is America's biggest client. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=886.4s)]
*  We do the most business with Canada. Here, play this clip. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=894.0799999999999s)]
*  During the campaign, Prime Minister Carney talked about the American betrayal. How did you react [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=901.76s)]
*  if Canada decided not to shop in the American store as much as before and decided to partner [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=907.04s)]
*  with other countries? Well, we don't do much business with Canada from our standpoint. They [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=913.76s)]
*  do a lot of business with us. We're at like 4 percent and usually those things don't last [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=918.6400000000001s)]
*  very long. You know, we have great things, great product, the kind of product we sell nobody else [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=924.4000000000001s)]
*  can sell, including military. Look, we make the best military equipment in the world and Canada [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=928.88s)]
*  buys our military equipment, which we appreciate, but we make the best military equipment in the [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=936.32s)]
*  world by far. The missiles, the submarines, everything, everything we have is really top [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=940.96s)]
*  notch. I rebuilt our military during our last term. Stupidly, we gave some away to Afghanistan, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=946.64s)]
*  which shouldn't have. In 2024, the U.S. did over $600 billion in trade with Canada. Like, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=952.32s)]
*  what are you talking about? Prime Minister Carney stands up to Donald Trump and says, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=959.76s)]
*  now, not ever, Canada will never be the 51st state. Donald, here, play this clip. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=966.56s)]
*  But we're not going to be discussing that unless somebody wants to discuss it. I think that there [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=996.56s)]
*  are tremendous benefits to the Canadian citizens, tremendously lower taxes, free military, which [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=1002.0799999999999s)]
*  honestly, we give you essentially anyway, because we're protecting Canada if you have had a problem. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=1008.3199999999999s)]
*  But I think, you know, it's it would really be a wonderful marriage because it's two places [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=1013.1999999999999s)]
*  they get along very well. They like each other a lot. Well, if I may, as you know, from real estate, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=1020.0s)]
*  there are some places that are never for sale. We're sitting in one right now, you know, Buckingham [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=1027.52s)]
*  Palace, you visited as well. And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=1033.12s)]
*  last several months, it's not for sale, won't be for sale ever. So chess, master chessmanship there. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=1040.3999999999999s)]
*  By Donald Trump. Have you read the art of the deal? Do you read the art of the deal? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=1050.0800000000002s)]
*  OK, Donald Trump has bankrupted most of his businesses, casino after casino, bankrupt, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=1056.4s)]
*  bankrupt, bankrupt, business after business that he lent his name to, bankrupt, bankrupt, bankrupt, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=1062.0800000000002s)]
*  bankrupt. Even if you look at his most recent crypto project, only 57 wallets made money on [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=1067.68s)]
*  his crypto, while like 770,000 crypto wallets lost money. When are you all going to realize that he [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=1075.6799999999998s)]
*  is a fraud, that he is a felon, that he is a sexual abuser? It's so obvious. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=1086.6399999999999s)]
*  Fox knows it too. That's why they're that's why they're panicking. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoFoDr-T6I&t=1096.24s)]
