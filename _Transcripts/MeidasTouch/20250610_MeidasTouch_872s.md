# Trump has DISASTER PRESSER which QUICKLY Goes SIDEWAYS
**MeidasTouch:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI)
*  Donald Trump just wrapped up a disastrous press conference in the Oval Office. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=0.0s)]
*  I think it was supposed to be about FEMA, but Donald Trump ended up whining and saying that, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=4.08s)]
*  if anybody starts to protest at my big military parade this weekend, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=10.24s)]
*  I'm going to put so much force against you. What a baby here. Watch this. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=15.36s)]
*  Celebrating big on Saturday. We're going to have a lot of, and if there's any protestor [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=19.84s)]
*  wants to come out, they will be met with very big force. By the way, for those people that want [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=23.6s)]
*  to protest, they're going to be met with very big force. I haven't even heard about a protest, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=27.92s)]
*  but this is people that hate our country, but they will be met with very heavy force. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=33.04s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. Then Donald Trump lies and claims that he [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=40.24s)]
*  spoke to California Governor Gavin Newsom a day ago, which is just 100% false. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Then Donald Trump said, you need to stop the death. There's not been a single person who has [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=52.0s)]
*  died as a result of the protests against ISIS raids against hardworking migrants here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=57.84s)]
*  But play this clip. When is the last time you spoke with Governor Newsom? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=66.64s)]
*  A day ago. Called him up to tell him, got to do a better job. He's doing a bad job, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=72.88s)]
*  causing a lot of death and a lot of potential death. If we didn't send out the National Guard, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=79.12s)]
*  last time we gave him a little additional help, you would have Los Angeles would be burning right [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=86.0s)]
*  now. Los Angeles would be not a lot different than what you saw take place in California and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=91.36s)]
*  Los Angeles just a little while ago. And as Governor Newsom then wrote, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=97.92s)]
*  there was no call, not even a voicemail. Americans should be alarmed that a president [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=102.72s)]
*  is deploying the Marines onto our streets and doesn't even know who he's talking to. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=109.04s)]
*  Hat tip to California Governor Gavin Newsom for the rapid response. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=116.0s)]
*  Then Donald Trump starts yelling at a reporter and saying that we won the war. We won the war. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  And if it wasn't for us, you'd be speaking German or you'd be speaking German and Japanese combined. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=127.28s)]
*  What? Here, play this clip. Only country that didn't celebrate the victory. And we're the one [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  that won the war. Okay. If it wasn't for us, that war, you would be speaking German right now. Okay. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=138.16s)]
*  Uh, we won the war and you might be speaking Japanese too. I mean, you might be speaking [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=144.0s)]
*  a combination of both. Then you have Kristi Noem there, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  because this was supposed to be about FEMA urging Californians not to elect [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=154.56s)]
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom again. Watch this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=160.32s)]
*  And Governor Newsom has done a disservice to the status of California for many years. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=163.44s)]
*  The people there should never elect him into a leadership position ever again. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  The governor's a nice guy, but he's grossly incompetent. When it comes to his railroad. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=172.96s)]
*  I think they're scared of California Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=177.52s)]
*  Then you have Donald Trump. Again, this was supposed to be, I think this press conference [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=181.52s)]
*  was supposed to be about, uh, Kristi Noem, the dog killer, cosplay, Homeland Security Secretary, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  like assuring people that there would be resources for FEMA, um, available in hurricane season. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=193.36s)]
*  But Donald Trump says we want to wean off FEMA. We shouldn't be dealing with it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=200.08s)]
*  It's the governor's we want off of FEMA. Watch what Donald Trump says. Let's play it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=204.0s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. So, uh, we want to wean off of FEMA and we want to bring it down to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=208.16000000000003s)]
*  the state level. A little bit like education. We're moving it back to the states. Uh, so the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=216.16000000000003s)]
*  governors can handle, that's why they're governors now. If they can't handle it, they shouldn't be [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  governor. But these governors can handle it and they'll work in conjunction with other governors. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=224.4s)]
*  Give each other a hand. As my friend Dan Coe, who was in the Biden administration and worked on [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=230.0s)]
*  disaster relief, says the federal government gave 76 billion dollars to Louisiana for Katrina relief [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=235.84s)]
*  efforts, not to mention physical resources and personnel. The entire state budget for Louisiana [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=243.2s)]
*  that year was 18 billion dollars. There's a role for states, but there's a role for the federal [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  government. States need the federal government. States need FEMA specifically for emergency [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=258.0s)]
*  relief. Dan Coe also says, as someone who worked on disaster response in the last administration, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=264.96s)]
*  I can say unequivocally that eliminating FEMA would be a debacle and cost lives. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=270.48s)]
*  Then Donald Trump says the FEMA thing has not been a very successful experiment. Let's play it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=276.0s)]
*  But the FEMA thing has not been a very successful experiment. Very, very expensive and it doesn't [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=281.44s)]
*  get the job done. You saw what happened in North Carolina under the past administration. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=286.88s)]
*  And when we got in, we did a great job for North Carolina, brought it back, but it was a disaster, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=291.28s)]
*  FEMA. And it has not worked out well. It's extremely expensive. And again, when you have a tornado or [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=296.0s)]
*  a hurricane or you have a problem of any kind in a state, that's what you have governors for. They're [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=303.6s)]
*  supposed to fix those problems. And it's much more local and they'll develop a system. And I think [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=309.2s)]
*  we have a great reason. And then Kristi Noem has to then assure people and says, but we're prepared [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=315.28s)]
*  for what's coming. Even though we're weaning off of FEMA, we're prepared for what's coming here. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=321.36s)]
*  Play this clip. Great job. Thanks, Chris. Yeah, Mr. President, we are in hurricane season right now. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=326.0s)]
*  It will last for the next several months and we are prepared for what is coming. We are anticipating [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  that we will have a higher than usual activity during this hurricane season. We could have three [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=337.68s)]
*  to five major storms up to a dozen other hurricane level thresholds that we will meet [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=343.36s)]
*  throughout this season. And FEMA stands prepared and has been working with all of our regions. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=350.16s)]
*  And of course, they're not prepared for what's coming. You've been seeing the reports that I've [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=354.72s)]
*  been doing where we show I show you the denial letters. FEMA has been denying supplemental [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=358.48s)]
*  assistance to Georgia and North Carolina and Arkansas or assistance in general to Arkansas. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=364.56s)]
*  Where's where has FEMA been in St. Louis with devastating tornadoes? Mississippi, Kentucky, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=374.0s)]
*  Indiana. I can go on and on. Donald Trump doesn't even acknowledge when these deadly storms have hit [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=381.36s)]
*  American states thus far and have killed dozens and dozens and dozens of people. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=388.32s)]
*  Trump doesn't even acknowledge that it even takes place. He ignores the whole situation. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=392.32s)]
*  Is listening to the craziness of the world making you just want to cuddle up on the couch with your [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=396.56s)]
*  cat? Me too. This podcast is sponsored by Smalls. If you're a listener of the show, you know that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=400.4s)]

*  Chubbs eats Smalls every day and his favorite flavor is the chicken and turkey. My cat prefers [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=428.4s)]
*  Smalls way more than their previous cat food. I legitimately did a taste test. I put two bowls [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=433.68s)]
*  side by side and they immediately went to Smalls. Since making the switch to Smalls, my cat has had [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=438.56s)]
*  fewer hair balls, more balanced energy, a healthier weight, a softer and shinier fur coat, and a less [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=444.08s)]
*  stinky litter box. Still not a believer in Smalls? Forbes ranked Smalls best overall cat food while [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=449.68s)]
*  Buzzfeed said, my cats went completely ballistic for this stuff. Smalls is possibly my favorite [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=456.48s)]
*  sponsor ever because my cat Chubbs is frankly obsessed. I use Smalls as a topper to transition [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=462.48s)]
*  Chubbs to Smalls and the transition went perfectly. My cat's breath is so much better and their fur is [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=468.0s)]
*  much softer ever since I switched to Smalls. Smalls also has a bunch of amazing treats and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=474.48s)]

*  So then Donald Trump goes and tells this weird lie story that he does. It's just a total lie [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=510.24s)]
*  where he says that he goes to Austria and these other nations and they say that they're forest [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=516.0s)]
*  nations and that they have better forest management and that Donald Trump had to teach California [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=522.0s)]
*  about forest management here. Watch this. Also when it comes to forest fires, so [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=528.32s)]
*  for years I've been meeting with heads of other countries and they are forest countries. They [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=534.6400000000001s)]
*  call themselves forest Austria and others and they say we're a forest nation. We live in a forest [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=539.9200000000001s)]
*  and they don't have forest fires. And in one case he said, you know, our trees are much more [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=546.88s)]
*  flammable than California, but we don't have forest fires because we clean the floor. We sweep [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=551.2800000000001s)]
*  the floor of leaves of dead debris of trees that fall because after 18 months the tree is like real, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=556.16s)]
*  it's like tinderwood and it goes up. It virtually explodes. Well, we don't take the trees out. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=564.0s)]
*  California is a disaster what they've done in California. They don't do anything. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=570.0s)]
*  And if you did, you wouldn't, you almost would not have forest fires. And you can say you, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=574.24s)]
*  in theory, you shouldn't have any forest fires. And we spend billions and billions of dollars a [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=578.64s)]
*  year because people don't clean the forest and we're going to clean the forest. We're going to [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=583.36s)]
*  start cleaning them. And as our editor in chief, Ron Filipkowski correctly writes, this story for [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=587.76s)]
*  years was always that he spoke to the president of Finland about it. Then the people in Finland [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=593.36s)]
*  started mocking Donald Trump. So in 2023, he switched it to someone in Austria. He also said [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=598.96s)]
*  in 2019 that nobody in the U.S. ever heard of forest management until he taught them about it. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=606.48s)]
*  Donald Trump then says that there were areas of Los Angeles last night that you could call [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=614.72s)]
*  an insurrection. Play this clip. Not playing around. Will you determine whether or not there is [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  an insurrection? Well, you'll take a look at what's happening. I mean, I could tell you there were [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=624.88s)]
*  certain areas of that of Los Angeles that you could have called it an insurrection. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=628.64s)]
*  Donald Trump then says that there's no timeline for how long the National Guard will remain in [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=634.16s)]
*  California. Whenever he wants, he may keep them there forever. Play this clip. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=639.36s)]
*  The National Guard be in California indefinitely. How long will they be there until you think? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=644.0s)]
*  Until there's no danger. It's easy. Look, it's common sense. You asked me that question. When [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=648.4s)]
*  there's no danger, they'll leave. You would have had a horrible situation had I not sent them. And [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=654.88s)]
*  horrible. It'd be reporting on a lot of death and a lot of destruction that's not going to take place. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=663.52s)]
*  I think if you look every night, it got less and less. They were met with very strong force, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=669.68s)]
*  the bad people, the bad sick people that do what they do. But these are paid people in many cases, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=674.64s)]
*  not in all cases, but in many cases. And they really are. They're agitators. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=680.16s)]
*  I was wondering if you had any... [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=686.5600000000001s)]
*  Then Donald Trump learns that Mexico's very popular president, Claudia Scheinbaum, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=688.08s)]
*  has been very critical of how Donald Trump has been treating protesters. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=693.84s)]
*  So then Kristi Noem, who by the way went to Mexico to suck up to Claudia Scheinbaum, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=698.0s)]
*  then has to criticize Claudia Scheinbaum. I condemn her. I condemn her. Here, watch this. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=703.0400000000001s)]
*  They really are. They're agitators. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=708.32s)]
*  I was wondering if you had any response to Mexican President Scheinbaum who condemned the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=710.64s)]
*  violence there. Have you been in touch with her at all? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=715.84s)]
*  Said what? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=717.6800000000001s)]
*  I was wondering if you had any response to what Mexican President Claudia Scheinbaum said in response. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=718.64s)]
*  What did she say? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=725.0400000000001s)]
*  She condemned the violence in LA. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=725.84s)]
*  Oh, I do too. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=728.0s)]
*  Yeah. Have you been in touch with her at all? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=728.72s)]
*  Well, you think I don't condemn it? I condemn the violence in LA, ladies and gentlemen. But I also [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=730.4s)]
*  stopped the violence in LA. And by doing what I did, I stopped the violence in LA. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=736.16s)]
*  That would have been, I think, maybe I'd ask Kristi to speak to that. That would have been [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=742.0s)]
*  an unbelievable tragedy. We would be talking, I don't know, that would even be here right now. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=747.4399999999999s)]
*  It would have been so bad. I'd probably maybe be out there. I don't know. But Kristi, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=752.0799999999999s)]
*  could you speak to that? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=756.7199999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. So in 2020, I was a governor of a neighboring state to Tim Walz and watched him [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=757.52s)]
*  let his city burn. And the president and I have talked about this in the past, and he was not [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=762.32s)]
*  going to let that happen to another city and to another community where a bad governor made a bad [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=766.5600000000001s)]
*  decision. So Claudia Scheinbaum came out and encouraged more protests in LA. And I condemn [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=771.44s)]
*  her for that. She should not be encouraging violent protests that are going on. If people [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=777.36s)]
*  are allowed to peacefully protest, but the violence that we're seeing is not acceptable [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=782.1600000000001s)]
*  and it's not going to happen in America. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=786.8800000000001s)]
*  Then Donald Trump says that residents of other American cities can expect ice raids like the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=788.9599999999999s)]
*  ones in Los Angeles. Here, play this clip. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=793.4399999999999s)]
*  our country. And I don't think that- [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=818.9599999999999s)]
*  I also want to give a quick hat tip to the company called Snapstream. That's the technology behind [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivsLsr466wI&t=821.12s)]
