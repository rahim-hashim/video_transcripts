# Trump HUMILIATED as Top Supporters TURN AGAINST HIM
**MeidasTouch:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U)
*  From Tucker Carlson to Marjorie Taylor Greene and everybody in between, you have a whole group [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=0.0s)]
*  of pissed off magas who can't believe what Donald Trump is doing on a whole series of issues, but [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=6.32s)]
*  they should believe it because it was pretty obvious what a destructive dictatorial force [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  he is, whether they're pissed about him for warmongering in the Middle East, whether they are [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=18.72s)]
*  pissed at him for targeting their families like the Latinos for Trump. Donald Trump has [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=24.159999999999997s)]
*  taken a wrecking ball to the country. Maga Republicans are on Medicaid. Maga Republicans [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=31.52s)]
*  rely on the Affordable Care Act and Medicare, and they're having lots of programs that are [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  ripped from them as well. It's almost like they thought this was all one big game, that this was [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=42.64s)]
*  some sort of, I don't know, maga cosplay role play thing until it started impacting their lives. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=49.2s)]
*  And, you know, I'm not fully convinced that a lot of them still get it, but you see people [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=57.040000000000006s)]
*  expressing the following online like Rudy Jab. The main reason I voted for Trump is this. I don't [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  want to see any more bloodshed. He's betrayed the vast majority of his voter base. And then this [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=67.12s)]
*  individual aggregated all of Trump's post from the past saying, in order to get elected, Obama will [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=73.04s)]
*  start a war with Iran. Obama will attack Iran in order to get reelected. I predict Obama will at [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=78.8s)]
*  some point attack Iran in order to save face. Remember that I predicted a long time ago that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=84.64s)]
*  Obama will attack Iran because of his inability to negotiate properly, not skilled. He got posts like [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=89.36s)]
*  this from this guy, Philip Anderson, where on October 8th, 2024, he writes, Donald Trump is [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=96.4s)]
*  literally right about everything. On June 15th, 2025, he posts, Donald Trump has completely [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=103.04s)]
*  failed us. You got Donald Trump attacking Tucker Carlson as kooky for Tucker Carlson saying that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=110.4s)]
*  we shouldn't send American troops to war. In Iran, you've got maga influencers like Texas Patriot [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  saying, f it, if Trump takes us to war, I'm done with this administration. I voted for no wars, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  cheap gases, no taxes, cheap groceries, making America healthy. Again, I'm not sure RFK Junior's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=129.6s)]
*  are a guy for that though. CBS News did a report this week about how the cuts to FEMA storm prep [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=135.68s)]
*  program are impacting red states and Trump voters the most. It focused particularly on the destruction [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=141.92s)]
*  that could be caused to states like Florida and Louisiana. If they're hit by hurricanes based on [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=148.4s)]
*  what Trump is doing, you've got people posting, I mean, there are tens of thousands of more than [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=153.12s)]
*  that post. Kenneth Rinkle, it's sad I voted for Trump for the term for the third time, thought he'd [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=159.6s)]
*  help with the price of gas, price of groceries, utility. But here in John Cornyn's district, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  things are higher than when Biden was president WTF. Wisconsin dairy farmers are suing the Trump [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=170.56s)]
*  administration for discrimination against white farmers. They're saying Trump's discriminating [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  white farmers based on his policies. And I just wonder as I share all those examples with you, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=182.16s)]
*  how people so easily kind of lost their agency and allowed this wannabe dictator to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=189.2s)]
*  impose their will lie about everything. And now they act all surprised and shocked. And don't [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=197.68s)]
*  get me started. I've done so many videos on the Cubans and Latinos and Venezuelans for Trump and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=203.76s)]
*  all of that. I want to bring in right now Shannon Watts. Shannon Watts is out with a new incredible [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=208.96s)]
*  book. The pub date is today. It's called Fired Up. I'm Fired Up. How to Turn Your Spark into a Flame [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=216.24s)]
*  and Come Alive at Any Age. And I think about Shannon, the No Kings protest this weekend also, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=222.24s)]
*  where there were lots of people who may not have even been voters, people who were on the sidelines, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=229.84s)]
*  and they showed up. So I want to talk about that. But I also want to talk about people who just kind [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=235.12s)]
*  of go through their life, not expressing themselves and not expressing their opinions on issues and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=239.68s)]
*  things. And then they find themselves slowly but surely being pulled in a rabbit hole where they [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=247.68s)]
*  can't get out of it. So first off, congrats on the book. Everybody of course knows you from [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=252.4s)]
*  Moms Demand Action, the largest group against gun violence grassroots organization. So talk to us [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=257.36s)]
*  about why you wrote this book and I think how it meets the moment. Well, you know, you were just [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=263.28s)]
*  explaining and describing someone who was exactly who I was, right, for 41 years. I was not very [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=269.76s)]
*  politically active. And so when the mass shooting happened at Sandy Hook School, I'm not sure anyone [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=276.4s)]
*  would have looked to me as the leader. I was a state home mom with five kids. I have severe ADHD. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=282.32s)]
*  I had a debilitating fear of public speaking. You know, not exactly the person someone would point to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  and say, oh, yeah, that woman over there, she can lead an organization against the most powerful, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=292.8s)]
*  wealthy, special interests that's ever existed. And yet, that's exactly what I ended up doing, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=297.92s)]
*  right, because I was able to, and this is what my book is about, marrying my values, my abilities, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=302.56s)]
*  and my desires and figure out what do I have to meet this moment? What do I have to offer and to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=308.8s)]
*  bring to the table? And look, given where we are in this country, I think you just laid it out very [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=315.2s)]
*  clearly. No one can afford to stay on the sidelines. No one. And you may not think of yourself [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=319.92s)]
*  as someone who is a gifted activist or someone who is politically motivated, but we all have to be, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=326.16s)]
*  right? Democracy is sort of like a sick child. When your kid is sick in the middle of the night [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=332.0s)]
*  throwing up and you're exhausted, you don't say, you know, good luck with this, I'll see you in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=336.56s)]
*  the morning. You hold their hand until they're better. And I think democracy is the same way. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=340.16s)]
*  And so what I really wanted to create is a manual for how do you figure out who you are and what you [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=344.8s)]
*  have to bring to the table personally, politically, professionally, and then how do you endure the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=352.32000000000005s)]
*  blowback that you're going to get during that experience? You know, probably not like me, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  you won't receive threats of death and sexual violence, hopefully, but you know, you will have [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=362.88000000000005s)]
*  people when you decide to pursue something you're passionate about, make snarky comments to you, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  maybe in the pickup line of your kid's school. How do you endure that? And then how do you use [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=371.52s)]
*  this to find your people? And I'm sure you've talked about this quite a bit, which is community [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=377.2s)]
*  and the importance of having conversations right now. It's not enough to knock doors a month out [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=382.56s)]
*  from an election. We need to be having conversations with our neighbors and within our community [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=387.84s)]
*  between now and the midterm elections and beyond. You know, you take a look at an issue like common [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  sense gun reform, and if you were to poll Americans, 65, 75 percent of people are in [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=398.32s)]
*  support of actually gun control. More, right? And then you look across the board at a lot of [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=405.44s)]
*  these very, you know, the issues that are portrayed as being controversial. They actually have [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=411.2s)]
*  overwhelming support, but what happens is, and this is what happens in dictatorships across the world, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=416.4s)]
*  where you have a small group of zealots are controlling the framing, the dialogue, the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=422.8s)]
*  discussion. They're shaming people because they're relentless with their attacks and it kind of pushes [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  the 65, 70 or even up to 80 percent away. And so community is so important. So what do you do? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=439.12s)]
*  So what's your suggestion? How does someone right now watching this say, I need to get, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=446.8s)]
*  I want to do something. How do they start? Well, the first thing you need to do is figure out who [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=451.67999999999995s)]
*  you are, right? What are your abilities? What do you have to bring to the table? The skill set that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=456.32s)]
*  I had when I started Moms Demand Actions was that I was a communicator. I had been in the corporate [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=460.08s)]
*  world in public relations for years, and so I knew how to build a brand. I knew how to tell a story, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=464.79999999999995s)]
*  but so many other women across the country brought their skills too. You know, whether they were [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=469.67999999999995s)]
*  website developers or organizers or lawyers, all of them mattered and they made a difference. So [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=473.76s)]
*  figure out what your abilities are. And if you don't know what they are, and I have all these [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=479.84s)]
*  exercises in the book to help figure it out, ask someone to tell you. And if you don't have the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=483.84s)]
*  skills that you want, you can go acquire those. The other thing is what are your values? You know, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=488.23999999999995s)]
*  they will change throughout your life. When I started Moms Demand Action, I was a 41-year-old [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=493.35999999999996s)]
*  mom of young kids. And so my values were very much about protecting my family and my community. Now [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=497.35999999999996s)]
*  that I am an empty nester, it's more about wisdom and passing on what I know to other people. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=502.08s)]
*  And then what are your desires? You know, I really wanted to stand up to the most powerful, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=507.52s)]
*  wealthy special interests that's ever existed with a badass army of women. And so that's what I set [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=511.76s)]
*  out to create. But those things are not going to be for everyone. So figure out what is the niche [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=516.88s)]
*  that you want to fill. And again, that's really what my book is all about. But then start to take [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=521.76s)]
*  those steps forward. You don't have to start an organization. You can join an organization. You [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=527.36s)]
*  can create something in your neighborhood or your community. Use your voice and your vote. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=533.04s)]
*  There's a political science scientist who talks about how you really just need 3.5% [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=537.68s)]
*  the population to rise up to affect real change. We have that. We saw that at the rallies over the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=542.48s)]
*  weekend. We know that this is going to matter and make a difference, but we have to keep this [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=548.0s)]
*  momentum going. So what does that look like? It looks like joining organizations that exist, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=552.64s)]
*  starting with what you know where you are right now, doesn't have to be perfect. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=558.0s)]
*  The last thing I will say is what I've seen in activism and probably in life is that people are [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=562.4s)]
*  frustrated by incrementalism. It's kind of a dirty word, especially among young activists. And I get [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=567.84s)]
*  it. I wish the system was set up for overnight wholesale change. It's not. So be patient and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=573.36s)]
*  understand you're playing a long game. It truly is incrementalism that leads to revolutions. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=579.28s)]
*  So finally, what do you say though to someone who may be trapped in a situation that they don't like, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=584.8s)]
*  not just the person who's not motivated, but someone whose family may be kind of deeply MAGA, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=591.2s)]
*  and they know deep in their heart that that's not who they are, but they think, oh, my neighbor's [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=597.44s)]
*  like that or my husband's like that or my parents are like that. And how do I gracefully exit that [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=603.0400000000001s)]
*  without disrupting the family unit or how does someone navigate that? Well, I'm glad you brought [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=610.72s)]
*  that up. So I would say two things. First of all, what you said earlier is absolutely true. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=618.32s)]
*  There's all these issues that we think are polarizing because, frankly, extremists want [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=622.32s)]
*  us to believe they're polarizing something like 70 to 90% of all Americans support background checks [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=627.12s)]
*  on all gun sales, depending on whether there's been a recent shooting tragedy. That's a huge [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=634.32s)]
*  amount of Americans and that many Americans don't agree on much. Right. So gun violence prevention [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=638.5600000000001s)]
*  is not polarizing. It's that we have these extremist lawmakers and they have a base of [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=643.92s)]
*  extremist voters who have really held sway over these conversations for decades. And so when we [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=649.1999999999999s)]
*  start to use our voices and our votes, you will see change. You know, I would use a state like [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=655.36s)]
*  Virginia as an example. I thought there was no chance in hell that that would become a blue state [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=659.76s)]
*  that would pass over a dozen gun safety laws by 2020. And that's actually exactly what happened. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=664.16s)]
*  We spent years laying the foundation to flip all chambers of the General Assembly. We outspent the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=669.92s)]
*  NRA in their own backyard. We created relationships with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. So by [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=676.0s)]
*  the time that we had a gun sense majority, we could go in and immediately pass all those laws [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=681.04s)]
*  and they have not been undone by the subsequent Republican governor. So again, incrementalism, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=686.4799999999999s)]
*  it saves the day. And the other thing I would say is what I have witnessed over and over again [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=691.8399999999999s)]
*  through Moms Demand Action is that when you come to conversations with data and anecdotes, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=697.36s)]
*  and you're willing to have those tough conversations, you can change hearts and minds, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  not necessarily of extremists, but of most Americans who live in the middle. You know, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=706.72s)]
*  my father and his wife, my stepmother, are Trump supporters. I'm pretty sure they voted for Donald [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=711.2s)]
*  Trump both times. And yet my dad shows up at Moms Demand Action events wearing his Moms Demand [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=717.04s)]
*  Action shirt, not just because he supports me, but because of all the conversations we have have [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=723.44s)]
*  convinced him that this is really part of his agenda too. And so I'm not saying that that's [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=728.32s)]
*  always possible, but I do think it's worth trying. Yeah, you know, it reminds me of when I spoke to [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=734.48s)]
*  a lot of governors in red states and I go and ask them and I said, well, you know, how is it that [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=743.2800000000001s)]
*  you are able to advocate for LGBTQ rights and still win in red states? And I frequently hear [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=748.8s)]
*  from these governors because I'm passionate about it, because I feel these things and I let people [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=756.4s)]
*  know that I'm passionate about it. And when people see that I really feel this way and I'm fighting [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=760.56s)]
*  for it, they respect that I'm a fighter and I don't hedge and I don't throw, you know, I don't flip [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=765.4399999999999s)]
*  flop when it comes to kind of core values and principles. This is who I am and I'm proud about [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=772.0s)]
*  and I thought that was important learning as well. I want everybody to go and check out your book [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=777.04s)]

*  kind of the perfect timing for fired up to be released. The book's called Fired Up, How to Turn [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc3A5vW1p-U&t=786.48s)]
