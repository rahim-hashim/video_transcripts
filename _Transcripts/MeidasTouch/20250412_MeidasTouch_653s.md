# Trump CRUMBLES on Saturday Morning after BAD NEWS
**MeidasTouch:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk)
*  Another weekend where Donald Trump is yet again golfing and vacationing in Florida on the taxpayer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=0.0s)]
*  dime after once again imploding the economy, causing extreme volatility, crashing the bond [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=5.68s)]
*  markets, crashing the dollar, bringing mortgage rates above 7%, and moving the Treasury yields [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=12.4s)]
*  for the 10 and 30 year yields to significantly high and alarmingly high levels. But Donald [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=18.48s)]
*  Trump is waking up to headlines like this from the usually reliable Wall Street Journal. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Trump wants to be impeached again. It's already in the cards thanks to his ill-founded trade war, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=29.2s)]
*  no matter how that war plays out. What this article says is that Donald Trump is using powers that he [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  doesn't have because the power to tariff is actually the power of Congress and that Trump is [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=42.08s)]
*  unlawfully using emergency war powers, in essence, to declare this trade war that is crashing the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  United States economy and sending the United States into a recession. So what's Donald Trump [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=55.28s)]
*  doing today though while he's golfing? What kind of important messages is he posting to try to [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=60.88s)]
*  address what he's doing? Well, he's posting photos and videos like this of Hillary Clinton [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=67.44s)]
*  from the golf course. Also, from his social media app, you get ads like this as you click through [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=74.08s)]
*  his post, Trump's $150 trillion gift to America. And it has a photo of Trump next to Bitcoin, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=81.68s)]
*  notably in the past year. Bitcoin is down close to 10%. What we just learned this morning as well is [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  that the United States published tariff exclusions for specified products that are subject to these [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=97.2s)]
*  exclusions, notably, and this includes China as well. Apparently, the U.S. is now excluding [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=104.24s)]
*  computers and smartphones and other electronics from the tariffs, despite Trump and all of his [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=111.28s)]
*  state regime media saying the iPhones and the electronics and the laptops and all of those [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=119.36s)]
*  products would clearly be subject to the tariffs. I mean, you remember Jesse Waters from state regime [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  media known as Fox, Howard Lutnick, Donald Trump's commerce secretary, that Jennings guy on CNN, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=131.68s)]
*  they're like Americans don't care about more expensive goods. Americans don't care about [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  more expensive iPhones. This is a trade war. This is what we need to do for our national security. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=143.44s)]
*  Remember, Lutnick said millions and millions of human beings will be screwing those little [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  screws in the iPhones made right here in America. I got receipts. I'll show you that in a minute. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  But just another part of the lies and chaos from the Trump regime. Here's the headline from the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=157.84s)]
*  Washington Post from moments ago. Phones, other electronics exempt from new tariffs. Trump [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=163.84s)]
*  administration says the announcement comes after Beijing and China responds to President Trump's [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=169.2s)]
*  escalating trade war with a 125% tariff on all U.S. goods early Friday. They also said in China, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=175.36s)]
*  they don't need to raise the tariff amount anymore because they've effectively shut the United States [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=183.44s)]
*  out of the Chinese market. And they said that Donald Trump's conduct is foolish and embarrassing [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=189.28s)]
*  and humiliating. The Washington Post writes the exemptions by Trump announced this morning appear [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=196.48s)]
*  to undermine Trump's quote economic revolution that seeks to move high tech supply chains and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=201.92s)]
*  parts suppliers inside the U.S. They still kind of adopt a Trumpian framing of it. I mean, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  just say that he's lying. He has no clue what he's talking about. This is about feeding his ego. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  He thought that Xi Jinping was going to fold and he was going to show, look, I made China submit. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  He didn't do that. He's backing down like the little coward cornered rat he is. No offense to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=222.96s)]
*  cornered rats. This from Bloomberg over the past week. China has already trade war proved its [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  economy. Companies and consumers will feel the pain from tariffs much less there than Americans. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=236.0s)]
*  For Xi Jinping, Trump's self-inflicted wound is an opportunity. China can present itself as a better [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=241.84s)]
*  representative of the rules-based international order. I did a video about this earlier this [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=248.88s)]
*  morning. That's what they're doing. They're going to Europe saying, buy our electric vehicles. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=254.16s)]
*  They're going to Australia and they're buying the beef there. They're creating alliances and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=258.16s)]
*  relationships across the world as the United States attacks friend and foe alike. And they're [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=262.4s)]
*  saying, look, we support free trade. We support your economy. Maybe we should talk. And that is [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=267.67999999999995s)]
*  after the United States from prior administrations spent a lot of time focused on deterrence of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  precisely that taking place. In a short period of time, Donald Trump has tanked the American economy, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=280.23999999999995s)]
*  put us on a trajectory towards a recession or even worse, and destroyed all of our alliances. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  The mighty dollar sliding sharply as Donald Trump's turbulent trade agenda has battered [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=292.24s)]
*  U.S. credibility in global markets and fan fears of a self-inflicted economic downturn. We've seen [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  the dollar crash and we see the credit markets freezing. As Spencer Akimian reports, the weekly [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=304.64s)]
*  share of home mortgage refinance applications that were rejected was the highest since October 2008, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=310.88s)]
*  the Great Recession then after the housing bubble. These things are very hard to reverse [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=320.0s)]
*  once they get going. As Akimian says, and I agree with, we must stop all the economic madness [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=325.2s)]
*  immediately. It cannot wait another day. Also, he posts that the benchmark gold auctions in London [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=331.04s)]
*  are seeing record demand because the United States is increasingly being viewed as an unreliable [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=337.52s)]
*  global actor. What we're seeing here is the dollar crashing. We're seeing foreign entities [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=343.44s)]
*  and foreign buyers not buying United States bonds. We're seeing the 10 and 30-year United [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=350.32s)]
*  States Treasury yields go to higher levels that they should not be going at reflecting an [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=355.6s)]
*  instability. People don't want to buy our notes, so they're looking elsewhere and they're looking at [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=361.68s)]
*  London's gold auctions now. One of the things we're learning about as well is that furniture [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=366.08s)]
*  producers in China who are not subject to that exemption, they've seen a complete halt in orders [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=371.04s)]
*  from U.S. importers. We're hearing the same across toys, apparel, footwear, and sports equipment. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=376.72s)]
*  Almost everything is on hold as it relates to China business. This is an article from Laurie [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=382.0s)]
*  Ann LeCroco. Trump tariffs on China will soon bring irreversible damage to most American businesses. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=388.8s)]
*  Tourism down, travel down into the United States, both because our allies don't want to visit a [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=397.04s)]
*  hostile nation like the United States that tries to bully and extort them. Also, it's just not safe. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=403.04s)]
*  People are seeing, am I going to end up in an ICE detention center without due process? Are you going [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=409.52s)]
*  to send me to El Salvador? What's this fascist authoritarian Trump regime going to do if I travel [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=414.0s)]
*  there? It's not a safe place to go. Apollo reports that arrivals at the top 10 airports [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=420.16s)]
*  in the U.S. have shown a rapid decline since late February. Travel from Canada is now expected to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=425.44s)]
*  plummet 20% this year, costing the United States $3.4 billion. You've got big Canadian [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  tourist destinations like Palm Springs and others saying, please come back, please come back, we [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=439.20000000000005s)]
*  need you to visit. But as long as Donald Trump's in charge, who threatened to conquer it, who to [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=443.68s)]
*  take it over to actually do a real war and a trade war? He ain't coming back while there's a [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=449.36s)]
*  hostile regime located to its south. Just some other news to report as well that we're learning [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=455.6s)]
*  about this morning. The CDC's cruise inspectors are being laid off as ship arrives in Florida with [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  norovirus outbreak. The people who test for norovirus to make sure that it doesn't spread [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  to the general population because on cruise ships norovirus is known to spread quicker because of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=474.4s)]
*  the conditions there. All of those people are basically being fired. So the Trump regime pro [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  measles, pro neurovirus. Also Trump's EPA plans to stop collecting greenhouse gas emissions data. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=485.44s)]
*  Trump's tariffs are also crushing the oil industry. Ain't no drill baby drilling because the oil [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=493.28s)]
*  industry is getting crushed and they don't even have the resources to buy new facilities. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=498.48s)]
*  Just to show you some of the receipts now that we know about these exemptions that Donald Trump [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=504.48s)]
*  linking and backing down to Xi Jinping. Xi Jinping is like, get out of here. I ain't submitting to [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=508.16s)]
*  you. So Trump's submitting to Xi Jinping. Remember when Jesse Waters last week said this? Now everybody [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=512.8000000000001s)]
*  says, oh, you know, we got these flat screen TVs, gotta have our cheap flat screen TVs. Okay. Does [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=518.08s)]
*  the guy really need $50 off a flat screen when his factory left, when he doesn't have a job in [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=525.68s)]
*  fentanyl is pouring into the country. That's the trade off we're talking about here. Now. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=532.88s)]
*  And remember on CNN when that Jennings guy, that right wing propagandist who goes on says this. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=536.88s)]
*  Like it or not sure Michael, they are our biggest trading partner. And if we were to manufacture [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=543.68s)]
*  iPhones here, iPhones will cost $3,500. The American people are not going to tolerate that. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=547.28s)]
*  We have one of the highest standards of work of working conditions here. I don't think that we [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=551.44s)]
*  can say forget you China. They literally. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. If we continue to [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=556.1600000000001s)]
*  put our own economic and national security future in the hands of our biggest enemy, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=563.84s)]
*  because effectively they use slave labor to build stuff. And that makes it better for us. That is [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=568.1600000000001s)]
*  terrible. I am 100% not okay with that, but I'm feeling in the reality of what is. But you are. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=574.24s)]
*  Do you want to change it? But we need to change it. I don't know that changing it means isolating [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=578.72s)]
*  us on the global stage. So what happened to. Then of course you had Howard Lutnick say this. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=584.0s)]
*  Great American workers, you know, we are going to replace on other networks of millions of people. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=588.88s)]
*  Well, remember the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=594.4s)]
*  to make iPhones. That kind of thing is going to come to America. It's going to be automated and [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=600.64s)]
*  great Americans. The trade craft of America is going to fix them. It's going to work on them. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=605.44s)]
*  They're going to be mechanics. There's going to be HVAC specialists. There's going to be electricians. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=610.96s)]
*  The trade craft of America are high school educated Americans. The core to our workforce [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=615.6s)]
*  is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=621.2800000000001s)]
*  tech factories, which are all coming to America. That's what's going to build our next generation [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=626.8800000000001s)]
*  of America. Are you. Well, there you have it folks. Let me know what you think. That's what's [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=633.04s)]
*  happening this morning in the United States of America and elsewhere. I've been myself. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=636.4s)]
*  This is the Midas Touch Network. Kids subscribe. Let's get to five million subscribers. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95YMaZHsjk&t=640.0s)]
