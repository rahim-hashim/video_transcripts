# MASSIVE GOP Scheme to STEAL Supreme Court hits FATAL END
**MeidasTouch:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c)
*  We've got major news out of North Carolina, folks, where the Supreme Court race back from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=0.0s)]
*  November was thrown into turmoil, where the MAGA Republican candidate for the Supreme Court seat, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=6.4s)]
*  Jefferson Griffin, refused to concede after losing in multiple recounts to Justice Allison Riggs, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=12.88s)]
*  who was on the Supreme Court, the Democratic-backed candidate, Justice Allison Riggs. At every step, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=21.2s)]
*  the MAGA Republican candidate, Jefferson Griffin, tried to challenge existing votes that were already [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=27.12s)]
*  counted. He tried to disenfranchise people. He tried to literally steal votes from people. This [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  had been a six-month ordeal where the votes of the people were just not being counted. It went [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=41.6s)]
*  through the state court system from the lower level court to their court of appeals to the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=49.2s)]
*  Supreme Court, where ultimately a subset of votes was ordered by the North Carolina Supreme Court [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=54.96s)]
*  to be recounted through this process, which was counter to what the will of the people were who [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=63.92s)]
*  actually voted. After the Supreme Court in North Carolina made that ruling separately, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=70.56s)]
*  Justice Allison Riggs was bringing an action in federal court. We just got a very important [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=76.32s)]
*  federal court ruling in this entire saga from, of all people, a Trump-appointed judge in North [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=82.88s)]
*  Carolina, a judge by the name of Judge Richard Myers. He got to hand it to the guy. He followed [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=89.92s)]
*  the law. He put politics aside. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Myers ordered the North Carolina [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  State Board of Elections to certify a 734-vote win for the Democratic Supreme Court Justice, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=104.72s)]
*  Allison Riggs, and rejected all of the MAGA candidate Jefferson Griffin's election protests. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=112.48s)]
*  The judge did stay the order for one week so that Jefferson Griffin may appeal. Knowing Jefferson [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=118.64s)]
*  Griffin, I'm sure he's going to do what Jefferson Griffin does. But when you take a look at this [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=124.48s)]
*  order by the District Court Judge, you get a Trump-appointed judge. I don't even like saying [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=129.12s)]
*  Trump-appointed judge, Obama-appointed judge, but I think it is still a notable factor here. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=133.6s)]
*  Here's what the judge wrote. This consolidated action concerns an attempt to change the rules [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=139.60000000000002s)]
*  of the game after it had been played. The court cannot countenance that strategy. Permitting [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=146.72s)]
*  parties to upend the set rules of an election after the election has taken place can only [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  produce confusion and turmoil, which threatens to undermine public confidence in federal courts, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  state agencies, and elections themselves. Accordingly, the court finds as follows. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=169.52s)]
*  One retroactive invalidation of absentee ballots cast by overseas military and civilian voters [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=175.52s)]
*  violates those voters' substantive due process rights. That's one of the things Jefferson [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=182.72s)]
*  Griffin wanted to happen. The cure process violates equal protection rights of overseas [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=187.52s)]
*  military and civilian voters. And three, the lack of any notice or opportunity for eligible voters [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=192.96s)]
*  to contest their mistaken designation as never-residents violates procedural due process [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=198.8s)]
*  and represents an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote. Therefore, the judge [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=204.8s)]
*  ordered that the win for Justice Allison Riggs be certified. Let's bring in Justice Allison Riggs [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=210.24s)]
*  to respond to this ruling. Where are we at? Where do we go for here? It's great to have you on, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  and we've been having you on now for a few months following this entire saga with you. So, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=223.44s)]
*  you know, here we are, May 6th, the order dropped May 5th. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=228.8s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much for having me, Ben. Six months to the day after election day after [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=232.72s)]
*  North Carolina voters spoke, a federal district court judge issued what was an enormous victory, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=237.44s)]
*  not just for North Carolina voters, but for voters all across the country. This has been [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=245.04s)]
*  a tough six months, but I'm no stranger to tough fights. And we knew all along that the threat [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  here was existential, that if people with power can toss out ballots selectively [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=259.92s)]
*  after an election, cancel the votes of people they think didn't vote for them, that democracy [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=267.04s)]
*  cannot exist in those conditions. And so we have been fighting tooth and nail in a courtroom, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  not just for North Carolina service members. That was a worthy enough fight for sure. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  North Carolina service members deserve to have someone standing up to defend them the way they [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=286.4s)]
*  defend us. But we knew that this would open the door to enormous mischief and frivolous challenges [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=291.52s)]
*  after election day across the country. So we're very gratified by the ruling and stand ready [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=300.88s)]
*  to continue the fight if need be. But really, this should have decisively ended it yesterday. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=308.0s)]
*  Can you remind our viewers what the 65,000 votes were that were being challenged? I know there was [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  one group of 60, then there was another 5,000 that were the military overseas. And maybe you [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  can describe also what Jefferson, Griffin, and the Republicans were doing to like specifically, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=331.52s)]
*  one, just target your race, not the other races, not the Trump race, not the other congressional [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  races. Those were apparently fine. And then they micro targeted democratic areas only to try to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=343.04s)]
*  change the vote after the fact. Can you go into that? Yeah. So the legal terminology for what [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=351.44s)]
*  this was is throwing spaghetti at the wall. My opponent decided to challenge it, reached as high [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=357.36s)]
*  as 68,000 eligible North Carolinians who cast lawful ballots. The biggest bucket, 60,000 of [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=365.44s)]
*  them were voters who were alleged to have information missing from their voter file, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=373.68s)]
*  including a social security number or a driver's license number. But that information is not [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=379.6s)]
*  required under federal law. Federal law actually provides that those voters can vote if they show [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=385.04s)]
*  a certain ID. My parents were in that bucket of 60,000. My dad is 30 years retired military. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=391.84s)]
*  He and my mom retired down to North Carolina to be near to me and my sister. They went to register [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=398.88s)]
*  in person using their military IDs, retired military IDs, which don't have driver's license [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  or social security numbers on it. The Department of Defense decided years ago not to put social [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=412.32s)]
*  security numbers on military IDs. So my parents followed every rule, did everything right, as did [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=417.28s)]
*  the rest of the 60,000 voters in that bucket. Over the course of the last six months, we were able to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=423.67999999999995s)]
*  knock out that challenge. Even the North Carolina Supreme Court said those voters did nothing wrong [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=429.52s)]
*  and we won't disenfranchise them. What has persisted has been the selective targeting of [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=435.11999999999995s)]
*  voters who use a federal mechanism to vote. It's called the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  Voting Act. It's a federal law designed to address how hard it is for military members and their [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=450.8s)]
*  family to vote when they are serving away from home or overseas. Upwards of 5,500 of those voters [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=456.15999999999997s)]
*  in four counties only were challenged. So these are people who used a specific [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=464.47999999999996s)]
*  identifiable kind of voting because they were service members or working overseas for certain [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=471.91999999999996s)]
*  reasons. My opponent, there's 100 counties in North Carolina, he picked four of the most [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=478.79999999999995s)]
*  democratic counties and challenged the military and overseas voters in those four counties only [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  and said they should be challenged. In other more red counties, no problem. And mine was the only [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=492.32s)]
*  race uncertified from the 2024 election cycle. It still is, but no complaints about [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump winning North Carolina in the presidential race. A number of Democrats and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=511.12s)]
*  Republicans won up and down the ballot. North Carolina is a very purple state. But this was [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=517.36s)]
*  really troubling and inconsistent challenging. It really is reminiscent of the arguments in [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=525.52s)]
*  Bush v. Gore where in the 2000 election the question was, well, do we do something in a [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  handful of Florida counties that we're not doing in other counties and subjecting military voters [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=539.36s)]
*  to the presumption that their vote is invalid unless they jump through hurdles, even when they [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=546.08s)]
*  may be serving on a submarine, under seas in the Atlantic Ocean, that that is unconstitutional. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=551.76s)]
*  And we were gratified that the federal court yesterday upheld every one of the arguments we [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=558.88s)]
*  made about why these challenges violated the federal constitution. We've talked about this [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=564.88s)]
*  concept of the laboratories of autocracy, how sometimes you're seeing these mega Republicans [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=571.2s)]
*  try out these playbooks in states and say, okay, well, we can do voter suppression here. We could [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=578.6400000000001s)]
*  gerrymander here. And now even if we lose the election after doing all of those things, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=583.6800000000001s)]
*  we can basically just kind of redo it. We can target certain areas, throw out 65,000 votes. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=590.08s)]
*  And it's why I think, you know, to your point, this has national implications here. If this stands, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=597.2s)]
*  they then kind of roll this out, this test balloon everywhere else. I just want to show the video of [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=603.92s)]
*  your parents because I think it brings it home when they're both like, if you add our ages up [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=610.24s)]
*  together, we've been voting for like a hundred years. Of course we're going to vote for our [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=615.28s)]
*  daughter. What are you talking? You're throwing out our votes for our daughter? What do you mean? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  Just watch this video. This is for our viewers. Yeah. Well, we were thoroughly shocked to find [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=622.5600000000001s)]
*  out there even was a list and then find out that we were on the list when we have voted [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=627.04s)]
*  successfully for 50 years. And combined, we have voted religiously for over a hundred years, the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=632.08s)]
*  two of us together. And this was the first time the ballots ever been challenged. And I know that [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=640.32s)]
*  my daughter had spoken a lot about recognizing voter suppression when she sees it. I can tell you, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=648.32s)]
*  this does not feel like election integrity. Personally, this feels like voter suppression [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=656.88s)]
*  when it involves us and a very important election to us personally, it involves our daughter. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=664.48s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you, Justice Riggs. So my parents were very proud when I graduated Georgetown law. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=672.72s)]
*  They were a little bit curious when I became a podcaster, but I got them back on my team now and [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=678.24s)]
*  they're proud again. But I can only imagine you got proud parents, you're a Supreme Court justice [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=683.2s)]
*  in the state of North Carolina. They go out to vote for you in the election and then they find out [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=690.0s)]
*  that, and they're going to be so careful. How could you be more careful than the parents [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=697.44s)]
*  voting for them? I bet you they looked at it, they took photos of it, they mounted it on the wall. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ77l1i_c&t=701.36s)]
