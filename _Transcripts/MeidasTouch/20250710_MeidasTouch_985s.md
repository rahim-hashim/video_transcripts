# FURIOUS World Leaders CHECKMATE Trump IN PUBLIC
**MeidasTouch:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8)
*  World leaders are absolutely furious at Donald Trump and the Trump regime, and they're moving on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=0.0s)]
*  We're seeing them holding meetings with each other and icing out the United States. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=5.64s)]
*  You have Prime Minister Modi of India meeting with President Lula of Brazil at the BRICS conference in Rio de Janeiro. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=10.72s)]
*  You've got President Lula of Brazil meeting with the President of Indonesia. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=19.2s)]
*  Take a look right here. This is the face of Mexican foreign policy right now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=25.12s)]
*  Used to be Mexico and the United States with a close bond. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  Here you have Mexico's foreign secretary with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, at the BRICS Plus Friends Summit last week. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=34.6s)]
*  Mexico and Russia as the United States weakens its relationship with Mexico. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=45.64s)]
*  You also have President Cyril Ramaphosa from BRICS, Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and then others who join, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=52.52s)]
*  which is called the sideline summit, like Mexico joined and others. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=61.52s)]
*  But remember how Donald Trump just made a fool of himself in the Oval Office with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=66.0s)]
*  Well, here's Ramaphosa in Rio de Janeiro. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=72.92s)]
*  I bet when he was in Rio de Janeiro with the other leaders, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=75.84s)]
*  they weren't accusing him falsely and defaming his country of committing a white genocide among the farmers in South Africa, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=78.76s)]
*  which is not happening, and he had to bring his white agriculture, African minister into the freaking Oval Office to say, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=86.76s)]
*  nope, that's not happening. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=93.68s)]
*  And Trump's like, I don't believe you. Let me show you this video that I've made. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=94.84s)]
*  How freaking embarrassing was that? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=98.56s)]
*  You just take a look here at a successful BRICS summit, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  from the sense of bringing in more countries and strengthening BRICS relative to the strength of the United States. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=104.72s)]
*  I mean, think about it. You had Donald Trump leave the G7 summit after less than a day, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=111.72s)]
*  run back to the United States, call Vladimir Putin, who offered to mediate the dispute with Iran. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=117.72s)]
*  Putin then escalated things in Ukraine shortly thereafter, and Trump made a fool of himself while other countries were meeting at the G7. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=125.2s)]
*  But now you have all of these countries meeting at the BRICS conference. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=133.56s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump also posted a letter to the president of Brazil, President Lula, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=137.44s)]
*  saying that he would be tariffing Brazil 50 percent because Donald Trump didn't like that Jair Bolsonaro, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=144.48s)]
*  the former president who tried to do a coup of Brazil, has been prosecuted by Brazil, frankly, the way Donald Trump should have been prosecuted. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=153.56s)]
*  So here was Donald Trump's letter to Brazil. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=162.56s)]
*  And then let me show you President Lula of Brazil's smackdown of Donald Trump. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=165.32s)]
*  And it should be noted that, like, the majority of our coffee, a massive portion of our orange juice and lots of other goods that we use here come from Brazil. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=171.2s)]
*  And it should also be noted that the United States has a trade surplus with Brazil, not a deficit. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=183.12s)]
*  And that Donald Trump is just making things up right here and things are going to get more expensive. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=190.64s)]
*  Look, I know that our markets think that Donald Trump's just a massive taco. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=195.2s)]
*  It's like, oh, this is what Donald Trump just says. Trump always chickens out. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=200.11999999999998s)]
*  He's going to say this, but then he's going to figure it out. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=203.88s)]
*  And so anything that Donald Trump says is BS. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=206.16s)]
*  This is causing long lasting systemic harm to the American economy. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=208.72s)]
*  There's a reason that the dollar is off to its weakest start since 1973 because America increasingly is losing its status as the world reserve currency. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=213.24s)]
*  Also, you take a look at a lot of the other data out there, not the BS data coming out of the White House and all of these Trump stooges, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=224.60000000000002s)]
*  but from the kind of third party sources with online shopping down, with new construction down, with inflation actually up. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=232.52s)]
*  I mean, you take a look at some of these stats out right there and it is all pointing in the direction of a recessionary time. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  Here's Donald Trump's letter to the president of Brazil. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=249.64s)]
*  Dear Mr. President, I knew and dealt with the former president Jair Bolsonaro and respected him greatly, as did most other leaders of countries. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=252.92s)]
*  And he like randomly capitalizes letters. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=262.28s)]
*  And that's not even true what he said. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=264.52s)]
*  The way that Brazil has treated former president Bolsonaro, a highly respected leader, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  the guy launched a coup he's not respected throughout the world during his term, including by the United States, is an international disgrace. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=271.0s)]
*  This trial should not be taking place. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=279.48s)]
*  It is a witch hunt that should end. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=281.48s)]
*  And he puts his own caps immediately due in part to Brazil's insidious attack on free elections and the fundamental free speech rights of Americans, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=283.24s)]
*  as lately illustrated by the Brazilian Supreme Court, which has issued hundreds of secret and unlawful, and those are randomly all capitalized letters, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=292.28s)]
*  censorship orders to the US social media platforms, threatening them with millions of dollars in fines and eviction from the Brazilian social media market. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  Starting on August 1, 2025, we will charge Brazil a tariff of 50 percent on any and all Brazilian products sent into the United States, separate from all sectoral tariffs. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=309.88s)]
*  Goods trans ship to evade this 50 percent tariff will be subject to a higher tariff. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=321.24s)]
*  In addition, we have had years to discuss the trading relationship with Brazil and have concluded that we must move away from the longstanding and very unfair trade relationship engendered by Brazil's tariff and non tariff policies and trade barriers. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=326.04s)]
*  Our relationship has been unfortunately far from reciprocal. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=340.68s)]
*  Please understand that the 50 percent number is far less than what is needed to have a level playing field. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=344.52s)]
*  We must have with your country and it is necessary to rectify the grave injustices of the current regime. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=350.12s)]
*  As you're aware, there will be no tariff if Brazil companies within your country decide to build or manufacture. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=357.32s)]
*  There is not a deficit with Brazil. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=363.64s)]
*  There is a surplus. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=366.12s)]
*  And let me show you how Brazil responded. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  President Lula writes the following. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=369.96s)]
*  In view of the public statement by the American president, Donald Trump presented on a social media network this Wednesday afternoon. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=371.96s)]
*  It is important to emphasize, meaning that Lula didn't get it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=379.88s)]
*  Trump just posted this on a social media platform. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=383.8s)]
*  How embarrassing is that? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=387.0s)]
*  Lula then goes, Brazil is a sovereign country with independent institutions that will not accept being tutored by anyone. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=389.4s)]
*  The judicial process against those who plan the coup is the sole responsibility of the Brazilian judiciary and therefore is not subject to any kind of interference or threat that undermines the independence of national institutions. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=397.24s)]
*  In the context of digital platforms, Brazilian society rejects content involving hate, racism, child pornography, scams, fraud and speech against human rights and democratic freedom. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=414.04s)]
*  In Brazil, freedom of expression is not to be confused with aggression or violent practices. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=426.03999999999996s)]
*  To operate in our country, all national and foreign companies are subject to Brazilian legislation. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=430.84s)]
*  It is false information in the case of the commercial relationship between Brazil and the United States regarding the alleged American deficit. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=436.68s)]
*  Statistics from the United States government itself confirm a surplus of that country in the trade of goods and services with Brazil and the amount of $410 billion over the last 15 years. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=444.28s)]
*  In this sense, any measure to increase tariffs unilaterally will be responded to in light of Brazil's law of economic reciprocity. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=455.08s)]
*  The respect and intransigent defense of interests of the Brazilian people are the values that guide our relationship with the world. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=462.68s)]
*  That is a smackdown right there. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=471.0s)]
*  Again, 60% of orange juice we drink from Brazil, 35% of coffee beans we roast from Brazil, 12% of cane sugar we put in our treats from Brazil. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=472.68s)]
*  Brazil, but what are we doing here? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=482.44s)]
*  What the hell are we doing here? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=483.96s)]
*  United States, I mean, not us, what Trump's doing here. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=485.4s)]
*  My dogs, Taquito and Chiquito, are the happiest dogs ever. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=487.47999999999996s)]
*  You know why? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=490.68s)]
*  Because I give them Sundays for Dogs, which is, let's face it, the best dog food ever. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=491.47999999999996s)]
*  What I love about Sundays for Dogs is that unlike other fresh dog food, Sundays does not require refrigeration or preparation because of their air drying process. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=497.64s)]
*  You just pour it and serve it and you can cancel or pause your subscription with Sundays for Dogs at any time with their 14 day money back guarantee. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=508.68s)]
*  It's fresh dog food. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=518.52s)]
*  It's made from a short list of human grade ingredients, which I love and I know my doggies love. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=519.5600000000001s)]
*  It was co-founded by Dr. Tori Waxman, a practicing veterinarian who tests and formulates every version of each recipe. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=525.64s)]
*  And Sundays contains 100% all natural meat and superfoods and 0% synthetic nutrients or artificial ingredients. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=534.92s)]
*  So here's the deal we negotiated for your puppies because I want them to be as happy as mine. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=544.04s)]
*  Get 40% off your first order of Sundays. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=549.8s)]
*  Go to Sundays for Dogs dot com slash Midas or use code Midas at checkout. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=553.64s)]
*  My doggies, Taquito and Chiquito, tell me that your doggies will love Sundays also. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=560.44s)]
*  And as that's happening, think about the past that Donald Trump has given to Putin. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=565.88s)]
*  Remember yesterday where I reported that Donald Trump claimed he did not know who stopped sending the Patriot missiles to Ukraine. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=570.6s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=578.52s)]
*  And oh, that the United States was going to send the missiles because they figured out what it was Hexagon and they were going to send it to Ukraine. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=579.32s)]
*  And oh, that the United States was going to send the missiles because they figured out what it was Hexagon who did it on his own. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=586.12s)]
*  They were blaming Hexagon. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=591.48s)]
*  Well, they still haven't sent the weapons to Ukraine. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=592.6s)]
*  And Vladimir Putin has escalated things each and every day. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=595.8s)]
*  As Jay and Keeve writes, buildings are burning in Kiev all night long as the city faces drone missile attacks three times larger than the day Trump came into office. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=600.2s)]
*  Despite humiliating Trump on a daily basis or despite Putin humiliating Trump on a daily basis, there are no new sanctions from the U.S., no new weapons package allocations, repeated attempts to block congressionally allocated weapons packages. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=611.16s)]
*  Trump is Putin's B word. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=624.92s)]
*  Trump's refusal to place any meaningful consequences onto Putin has created a catastrophic nightmare for the people of Ukraine now facing drone and missile barrages of nearly 750 per attack. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=626.92s)]
*  Putin used this time as we knew he would to build up his war machine. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=639.0s)]
*  So Donald Trump held that bizarre press conference yesterday with the five African leaders and a reporter asked him, hey, you said yesterday you weren't sure who ordered munitions being halted to Ukraine. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=643.24s)]
*  Have you figured it out? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=656.52s)]
*  And Trump's like, no, I haven't even thought about it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=657.64s)]
*  You're playing this clip. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=660.44s)]
*  Sir, yesterday you said that you were not sure who ordered the munitions halted to Ukraine. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=661.5600000000001s)]
*  Have you since been able to figure that out? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=668.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, I haven't thought about it because we're looking at Ukraine right now and munitions, but I have no I have not gone into it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=670.2s)]
*  What does it say that such a big decision could be made inside your government without you knowing? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=677.4s)]
*  I would know if a decision was made. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=682.36s)]
*  I will know. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=684.6800000000001s)]
*  I'll be the first to know. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=686.04s)]
*  In fact, most likely I'd give the order, but I haven't done that yet. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=687.32s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=690.84s)]
*  Why didn't you know? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=691.88s)]
*  I always know. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=693.0s)]
*  Did you hear what he said right there? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=694.0400000000001s)]
*  So then the next question is, are you going to send the Patriot systems to Ukraine? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=695.8000000000001s)]
*  And Trump goes, I bet they like it. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=699.96s)]
*  I bet they like it. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=702.36s)]
*  What a sick abuser. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=703.96s)]
*  That's why I say this guy is a felon. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=705.4s)]
*  He's an abuser. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=707.8000000000001s)]
*  He's a sexual abuser. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=708.76s)]
*  He is a fraud. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=711.5600000000001s)]
*  He's a bankrupt or sick vile piece of trash that he is here playing this clip. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=713.32s)]
*  Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the White House was [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=718.6s)]
*  weighing whether to send another Patriot air defense system to Ukraine. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=722.2s)]
*  Can you confirm that reporting? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=725.48s)]
*  They would like it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=727.8000000000001s)]
*  They've asked for it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=729.08s)]
*  They're very rare indeed, you know, because a lot of systems have been sent to Ukraine. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=730.2s)]
*  But they would like to I know they made the request. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=736.28s)]
*  We're going to have to take a look at it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=738.36s)]
*  It's very expensive, very expensive system. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=740.0400000000001s)]
*  It's a shame that we have to spend so much money on a war that would have never happened [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=742.52s)]
*  if I were president. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=747.08s)]
*  That's a terrible, terrible war over there. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=748.04s)]
*  And it's really a shame. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=751.0s)]
*  It's very sad. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=753.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, when you talk about a system like that, highly sophisticated, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=754.68s)]
*  tremendous amount of money, and they're doing it because they want to prevent death. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=758.1999999999999s)]
*  They're getting hit hard, very hard. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=762.28s)]
*  So we're looking at it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=765.3199999999999s)]
*  Mr. President, Ukraine was hit by over 700 drones sent by Russia last night. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=766.4399999999999s)]
*  What's your response to that? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=772.76s)]
*  Well, I've been sort of letting people know I'm not happy [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=774.36s)]
*  about what's going on. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=777.8s)]
*  It's a war that should have never happened. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=778.8399999999999s)]
*  It should not happen now. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=780.52s)]
*  They're losing. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=781.8s)]
*  Now it's up. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=782.76s)]

*  7000 people a week on both sides. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=787.24s)]
*  7000 people, young, mostly military people, young souls are dead and dying. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=789.4s)]
*  And it should be stopped. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=797.9599999999999s)]
*  Should be stopped. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=799.8s)]
*  Very sad to see what's happening. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=801.0799999999999s)]
*  And here he is asked. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=802.92s)]

*  Yes, just so you can see what's actually going on in Ukraine. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=839.88s)]
*  Here it is 3 a.m. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=843.24s)]

*  And so the Pope Leo XIV invited President Zelensky to the palace in Rome and here at [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=853.24s)]
*  the Vatican. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=870.52s)]
*  And here is what Zelensky says. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=871.4s)]
*  A great honor for me to be here in a place which has contributed to shaping the history [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=873.16s)]

*  Finally, it should be noted that yesterday Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote an op-ed [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=895.24s)]
*  in the USA Today where he basically begged countries to buy their defense material from [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=901.88s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=908.9200000000001s)]
*  We're seeing lots of countries, whether it's Canada, Australia, they're looking more towards [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=909.8s)]
*  other manufacturers because they don't trust the U.S. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=914.68s)]
*  They think the U.S. may bug the stuff that U.S. is going to give them degraded equipment [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=917.8s)]
*  that if you start buying stuff from the U.S., the U.S. will not give you the parts as Donald [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=922.5999999999999s)]
*  Trump's extortion plans play out. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=927.56s)]
*  So here's what Rubio says in his op-ed. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=930.28s)]
*  So you could read it for yourself. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=932.3599999999999s)]
*  He goes, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=934.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's what was buried in there. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=940.84s)]
*  You must let. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=943.0799999999999s)]
*  Why do you think they're not allowing it, idiot? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=944.68s)]
*  Because they don't trust you anymore. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=947.24s)]
*  Because the world is furious at the Trump regime right now. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=949.48s)]
*  And you've made America the laughing stock to our enemies. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=953.0s)]
*  And you've made America a horror show to our once former allies who are now looking elsewhere. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66Yx0LY4V8&t=956.68s)]
