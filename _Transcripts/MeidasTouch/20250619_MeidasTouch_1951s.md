# Obama DESTROYS Trump at SURPRISE PUBLIC SPEECH
**MeidasTouch:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4)
*  My inauguration had more people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=0.0s)]
*  And that's demonstrable. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=5.16s)]
*  I say that by the way, not because I don't care. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  But facts are important. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=17.28s)]
*  Former president Barack Obama brought the house down. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=19.68s)]
*  This was one of the biggest speeches he has given thus far during the Trump regime. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=23.28s)]
*  You heard him right there talking about objective facts. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=30.08s)]
*  This all took place at the Connecticut forum. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=32.88s)]
*  Heather Cox Richardson was the moderator of this incredible event. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=36.12s)]
*  I want to play for you some key portions of this event. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=41.08s)]
*  You'll hear from former president Barack Obama. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=44.84s)]
*  I really want to hear more from him in times like this, because when he delivers these [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=49.04s)]
*  speeches, it is incredible. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  And the way he knows how to precisely go after Donald Trump and meet the moment is a skill [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=56.440000000000005s)]
*  that is really unique to former president Barack Obama. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=63.28s)]
*  So let me share this clip with you right here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=66.88000000000001s)]
*  You're going to want to watch every minute of this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=69.2s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=71.4s)]
*  We're also witnessing is that when the system is captured by those who, let's say, have [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=72.28s)]
*  a weak attachment to democracy, are not. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=83.08s)]
*  But I don't even think that's a controversial statement at this point. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=94.92s)]
*  No, I'm actually being serious now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=98.96s)]
*  It was a it was a controversial statement. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=102.12s)]
*  Now it is self-acknowledged. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=105.8s)]
*  If you follow regularly what is said by those who are in charge of the federal government [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=107.64s)]
*  right now, there is a weak commitment to what we understood and not just my generation, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=116.88s)]
*  at least since World War II, our understanding of how a liberal democracy is supposed to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=131.0s)]
*  work. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=143.68s)]
*  And when I say liberal, I don't mean left. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=143.88s)]
*  I mean, liberal in the sense of believing in rule of law and independent judiciary and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=145.64s)]
*  freedom of the press and freedom of assembly and protest and compromise and pluralism. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=152.44s)]
*  All those institutional norms and laws that were embodied in the Constitution [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=166.4s)]
*  and then over time were expanded so that we had a basic understanding of why I can't just [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=176.76s)]
*  be picked up on the street and hauled off to another country. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=184.28s)]
*  That's not something that's not that's not that that wasn't a that wasn't a partisan [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  view. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  That wasn't a Republican or Democratic notion that that shouldn't happen. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=198.76s)]
*  That was an American value. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=202.88s)]
*  And so so what I believe it continues to be that there has to be responses and pushback [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=205.84s)]
*  from civil society, from various institutions and individuals outside of government. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  But there also has to be people in government in both parties who say, well, no, you can't [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=234.92s)]
*  do that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=245.0s)]
*  And what we're seeing right now is when you do not have those constraints and guardrails, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=250.76s)]
*  when you don't have people inside of government who say, no, this is how the law works and we [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=255.72s)]
*  should follow it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  Democracy is not self-executing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=272.28s)]
*  It requires people, judges and people in the Justice Department and people throughout the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=274.64s)]
*  government who take an oath to uphold the Constitution. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=286.04s)]
*  It requires them to take those that oath seriously. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=292.48s)]
*  And when that isn't happening, we start drifting into something that is not consistent with [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  American democracy. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=315.0s)]
*  It is consistent with autocracies. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=316.79999999999995s)]
*  It's consistent with Hungary under Orban. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  It's consistent with places that hold elections but do not otherwise observe what we think [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=328.12s)]
*  of as a fair system in which everybody's voice matters and people have a seat at the table [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=337.24s)]
*  and their checks and balances and nobody's above the law. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=344.2s)]
*  And we're not there yet completely, but I think that we are dangerously close to normalizing [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=350.56s)]
*  behavior like that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=366.52s)]
*  And we need people both outside government and inside of government saying, let's not go [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=368.6s)]
*  over that cliff because it's hard to recover. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=377.96s)]
*  And part of the reason I think, it's interesting, when I was first elected, we were in the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=384.12s)]
*  middle of a huge global financial crisis. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=395.24s)]
*  It had started on Wall Street, so understandably other countries were annoyed about it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  And the Iraq War obviously was not popular around the world. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=403.76s)]
*  And so our reputation and our leadership globally had dipped pretty significantly. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=411.44s)]
*  And so I come in first year and I'm doing a lot of travel and making a lot of speeches [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=421.15999999999997s)]
*  and holding town halls like this in foreign countries. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=426.76s)]
*  And one of the raps that I got from the opposition, the Republican side, was, he's on an apology [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=430.44s)]
*  tour. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=439.32s)]
*  And basically what they were arguing was that I wasn't just going around bullying other [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=440.76s)]
*  countries and telling them that we're better than you, which I thought was a bad strategy [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=448.12s)]
*  to get them to cooperate. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=453.96000000000004s)]
*  That's human nature, I think. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=457.96000000000004s)]
*  But what they always missed and what I would always say everywhere I went around the world [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=466.28000000000003s)]
*  was, what makes America exceptional is not that it has the biggest military, it's not that it has [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=477.08s)]
*  the largest economy. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=485.32s)]
*  What really makes America exceptional is that it's the only big country on earth and maybe the only [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=488.44s)]
*  real superpower in history that is made up of people from every corner of the globe. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=500.68s)]
*  And they show up, they come here, and the glue that holds us together is this crazy experiment [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=510.68s)]
*  called democracy. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=526.2s)]
*  And this idea that we can somehow, despite all our differences, we don't look alike, we don't [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=528.2s)]
*  worship God in the same way, we don't like the same foods. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=541.32s)]
*  And yet, when this experiment works, it gives the world a little bit of hope. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=548.6s)]
*  Because it says it is possible for human beings who are not bound by tribe or race or blood, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=558.44s)]
*  but are instead bound by an idea, that they can somehow work together and arrive at a common good. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=569.08s)]
*  That's what made America exceptional. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=578.44s)]
*  And so, I think we have to recover pride in that. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=581.24s)]
*  That's what makes us special. That and our capacity through this constitutional process [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=600.12s)]
*  and representative government and an adherence to certain ideas has allowed us to get better. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=609.0s)]
*  Not perfect, but get better over time. With just one big civil war, large exception, but otherwise, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=618.92s)]
*  we've managed to make real progress. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=630.28s)]
*  You know those mornings where you wake up and your coffee just doesn't cut it? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=634.84s)]
*  That was me this week, low energy, dragging through my workout, and ready to quit halfway through. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=637.64s)]
*  That's when I reached for Peak Beats from Peak Pure and Natural. This podcast is sponsored by [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=642.28s)]
*  Peak Pure and Natural, and their product, Peak Beats, is a simple natural way to support energy, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=647.72s)]

*  I want to play for you this other incredible portion of this event at the Connecticut Forum. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=708.5999999999999s)]
*  Let's play it. One of the most important challenges, I think, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=714.1999999999999s)]
*  our democracy faces is how do we regain some common sense of truth. Not absolute truth, but [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=718.68s)]
*  rough, basic truth. In 2020, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=733.16s)]
*  one person won the election, and it wasn't the guy complaining about it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=741.88s)]
*  And that's just a fact. That wasn't [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=746.0400000000001s)]
*  just like, you know, my inauguration had more people. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=753.32s)]
*  And that's demonstrable. I say that, by the way, not because, like, I don't care. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=760.2s)]
*  But facts are important. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=769.64s)]
*  Because if you can't, and I think one of the most pernicious things that has happened is [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=776.12s)]
*  we have a situation now where we're not just arguing policy or values or opinions, but [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=787.72s)]
*  basic facts are being contested. And that is a problem. Because then the marketplace of ideas [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=796.7600000000001s)]
*  of the democracy don't work. I've said this before, but I always repeat it. You and I can [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=805.08s)]
*  have an opinion about this little side table. You know, you might not like the design, you might not [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=810.0400000000001s)]
*  like the color or how it's finished, but we can have that discussion. If I say to you, this is a [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=821.8000000000001s)]
*  lawnmower, you'll think I'm crazy. And if I really believe it, I'll think you're crazy. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=833.8000000000001s)]
*  And we're now in a situation in which we are having these just basic factual arguments. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=844.36s)]
*  And that further undermines trust. And those in power, those with money, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=851.48s)]
*  exploit that space in which nobody knows what's true. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=867.64s)]
*  Vladimir Putin and the KGB had a saying that was then adopted proudly by Steve Bannon, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=871.8s)]
*  which was, if you want [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=891.3199999999999s)]
*  propaganda to be effective, you don't have to convince people that what you are saying is true. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=895.56s)]
*  You just have to flood the zone with so much poop. They use a different word, but you have to flood [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=906.4399999999999s)]
*  the zone with so much untruth constantly that at some point people don't believe anything. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=917.0s)]
*  So it doesn't matter if a candidate running for office just is constantly, just hypothetically, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=932.52s)]
*  saying untrue things. Or if an elected president claims that he won when he lost, and that the [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=943.48s)]
*  system was rigged, but then when he wins, then it isn't rigged because he won. It doesn't matter [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=954.84s)]
*  if everybody believes it, it just matters if everybody starts kind of throwing up their hands [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=963.8000000000001s)]
*  and saying, well, I guess it doesn't matter. And that's what's happened. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=970.28s)]
*  That's what's happened in one of our major political parties. You have a whole bunch of people [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=980.04s)]
*  who know that's not true, but we will pretend like it is. And that is dangerous. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=988.84s)]
*  And finally, here's the last clip I want to share with you from this truly incredible event where [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1002.44s)]
*  former president Barack Obama did not hold back. Here, play this clip. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1008.76s)]
*  There is a story about America that includes everybody. It's a good story. It's a story about [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1013.88s)]
*  people who aren't pretentious and don't believe that anybody is worse than them [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1026.04s)]
*  or better than them. That we're all endowed with our core dignity and our deserving of rights [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1043.64s)]
*  and respect and have to assume responsibility for ourselves individually and our collective lives. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1060.2800000000002s)]
*  We all play a part. And that historically has not been a, I'm repeating myself here, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1073.64s)]
*  it hasn't been a Republican or a Democratic idea. That is an American idea that everybody could tap into. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1085.48s)]
*  And if that ends up being our starting point for a common identity, if our starting point is [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1094.76s)]
*  these homespun values of we don't have aristocracies here, we don't have rank, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1105.8s)]
*  we don't have monarchies, we have rule of law, all people are equal in the eyes of the law, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1113.24s)]
*  that we all have a part to play in democracy, that we all have to take individual responsibility [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1127.88s)]
*  for our lives, but we also have to, as Lincoln said, do some things together because we can do [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1136.92s)]
*  better together than we can do it apart. If that's our starting point, then I think [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1142.8400000000001s)]
*  we'll be okay. But that's not where we are right now. I think right now what we're seeing is [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1152.3600000000001s)]
*  a politics that is reasserting a bad story of America, which is that [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1159.64s)]
*  even if there are technically ranks, we like the idea of caste and we like the idea of hierarchy. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1170.44s)]
*  And some people, this is our country, the real Americans, and these other folks are the phony [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1181.96s)]
*  and the fake Americans, or not even American. And that story also has a deep [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1190.68s)]
*  history in this country that says, okay, the first Americans aren't Americans, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1203.88s)]
*  and slaves are not Americans, and women are sort of Americans as long as they're doing [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1210.9199999999998s)]
*  what their husbands say, and people have different sexual orientations. They're not, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1219.6399999999999s)]
*  we don't even want to hear about them. That story has been part of America as well. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1228.84s)]
*  People sometimes ask me, what is my favorite? What is the favorite of the speeches I've given? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1234.44s)]
*  And probably my favorite, and it will be a portion of it's on the face of the presidential center that [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1242.3600000000001s)]
*  we'll be opening next year in Chicago, is the speech I gave in Selma for the 50th anniversary. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1252.76s)]
*  And the reason I love that speech is because, to me, that contest on the Edmund Pettus Bridge is [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1259.48s)]
*  as important a battle as Concord and Lexington and Appomattox, because you have, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1270.6s)]
*  you have on one side, you have on one side John Lewis in a backpack and an apple and a toothbrush, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1280.76s)]
*  and maids, and college students have flown down, and rabbis, and young priests, and [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1288.92s)]
*  they are carrying with them across that bridge this story, this better story, that [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1299.16s)]
*  we're all equal, we all have a place, nobody's worse, nobody's better, and we can all join [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1305.8000000000002s)]
*  together. And on the other side, you've got, you've got a lot of people who are in the same [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1313.8000000000002s)]
*  place, nobody's worse, nobody's better, and we can all join together. And on the other side, you've got [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1321.5600000000002s)]
*  folks on horseback with billy clubs and guns and dogs, and they're carrying a different story, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1329.88s)]
*  which is, no, ignore what we say in the Declaration of Independence, we have caste. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1338.44s)]
*  And some people are better and more deserving than others and have more power and more wealth. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1347.88s)]
*  And so I think we are, you know, that question right now is being called, and you asked about [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1360.3600000000001s)]
*  universities, law firms, businesses. One of my bigger concerns is when I see institutions [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1368.44s)]
*  power before this bad story because they're worried that it will [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1381.4s)]
*  affect their bottom lines in some fashion. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1390.6000000000001s)]
*  And the question I've asked, you know, because there have been partners in law firms who have [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1393.64s)]
*  called me and asked me about this, there have been university presidents who I've had [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1398.2s)]
*  conversations with about this, businesses who have asked me how they think they should handle this. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1401.5600000000002s)]
*  And what I've said to them is, well, what do you believe? Like, like, you know, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1408.92s)]
*  what do you believe? Like, that's your starting point. What do you care about? What's your mission? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1419.3200000000002s)]
*  If you believe, if you are a university, what is your core mission? And if, as I think your [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1430.44s)]
*  core mission should be, it's to teach, to transmit knowledge and broaden horizons for young minds [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1441.16s)]
*  and transmit information that allows them not just to get a job but also to live meaningful lives and [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1451.48s)]
*  be good citizens. If that's your mission, then it really doesn't matter what the threats are coming [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1458.2s)]
*  for now. You push back against somebody who says you can't carry out that mission. If you are a law firm, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1466.12s)]
*  then, now, obviously, you're running a business, it's a partnership, you're billing, you want clients, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1476.28s)]
*  but you're also all supposed to be officers of the court. You went into [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1486.36s)]
*  the law, presumably not just because you couldn't think of anything else to do, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1494.04s)]
*  or your dad or your mom thought it was a good idea. Presumably, you went into the law because you [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1501.08s)]
*  believe in the law. So, if you are getting pressure from government saying, ignore or fudge [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1508.04s)]
*  or compromise that commitment, you have to push back. Now, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1524.04s)]
*  one thing that I've noticed, and I've said this before in a few other venues, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1532.36s)]
*  Heather, you and I, we both grew up after World War II and America's [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1539.24s)]
*  colossus around the world, and we're exporting all these ideas, and our economy is growing. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1548.2s)]
*  Terrible things have happened during our lifetimes. Vietnam, assassinations, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1556.52s)]
*  killing fields, Rwanda. I don't want to, in any way, minimize those things. But what's been [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1565.88s)]
*  fascinating about this period in our history, and it's anomalous, is that things got steadily better. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1572.36s)]
*  The world became hugely wealthier and healthier and better educated, and infant mortality dropped, and [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1583.08s)]
*  women and girls suddenly had access to education. Human rights became an idea that people violated, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1596.68s)]
*  but were guilty about. Listen to, sometimes, the Nixon tapes just talking about bombing Cambodia. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1608.52s)]
*  Crazy how indifferent they were in ways that were taken for granted then, and now, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1619.6399999999999s)]
*  whatever differences I have with the Bush administration, they wouldn't have conversations [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1626.36s)]
*  like that, and that happened just in 20 years. So, I think a lot of us started to take it for granted, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1630.44s)]
*  and part of what happened was, if you were relatively privileged to have been grown up in [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1639.24s)]
*  the United States of America during this period, you could be as progressive and [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1645.56s)]
*  socially conscious as you wanted, and you did not have to pay a price. You could still make a lot [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1650.36s)]
*  of money, you could still hang out in Aspen, and Milan, and travel, and have a house in the Hamptons, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1658.6s)]
*  and still be, and still think of yourself as a progressive. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1670.2s)]
*  And now, things are a little different. Your commitments are being tested. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1677.56s)]
*  Not the way Nelson Mandela's commitments were tested, where you go to jail for 27 years. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1685.48s)]
*  Not the way Nelson Mandela's commitments were tested, where you go to jail for 27 years. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1690.2s)]
*  You might lose some of your donors if you're a university, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1696.6000000000001s)]
*  and if you're a law firm, your billings might drop a little bit, which means you cannot [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1704.6000000000001s)]
*  remodel that kitchen in your house in the Hamptons this summer. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1710.2s)]
*  And if you're a business, and this has happened because I've been getting calls about it, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1721.0s)]
*  yes, you may be threatened by an administration that says, we won't approve a merger, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1725.56s)]
*  or we will launch an investigation of you, and we will make you uncomfortable. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1732.52s)]
*  Part of what all this tariff stuff is about, by the way, because it's such... [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1742.3600000000001s)]
*  It is such poorly thought out economics. So you kind of wonder, well, why would you do something [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1751.0800000000002s)]
*  that's just not well thought out? I mean, you can apply tariffs. There's a place for tariffs to [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1762.3600000000001s)]
*  help open up markets and leverage. The United States sometimes gets taken advantage of because [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1770.52s)]
*  we've been the biggest market. China in particular, as it came up, started taking [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1776.6s)]
*  advantage of the rules, and my administration applied tariffs as well, occasionally to counteract [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1784.04s)]
*  these bad practices. But that's not what's going on now. What's going on now is that [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1791.24s)]
*  the tariffs means everybody has to come to you for favor. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1798.52s)]
*  You apply blanket tariffs around the world, now suddenly Vietnam's got to negotiate tariffs, and [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1811.3999999999999s)]
*  oh, would it be helpful in terms of lowering tariffs if maybe we approved a golf course for [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1818.04s)]
*  a certain business? All right, let's discuss that. So what's happening is that we now have a situation [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4w0Rx490g4&t=1825.32s)]
