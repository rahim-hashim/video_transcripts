# Trump VERY Publicly SCREWS OVER States who VOTED HIM
**MeidasTouch:** [April 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q)
*  The Retribution Tour continues. Donald Trump is denying FEMA aid to North Carolina in connection [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=0.0s)]
*  with Hurricane Helene. You'll recall we previously reported how Donald Trump denied FEMA aid to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=7.68s)]
*  Georgia. Democratic governor in North Carolina, Republican governor Kemp in Georgia. Donald Trump [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=16.0s)]
*  doesn't like either, and Donald Trump previously said recently that he wants to gut FEMA, get rid [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=23.2s)]
*  of it. He says he's going to replace it with the states, whatever that means, and that it's going [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=30.4s)]
*  to be much bigger and more beautiful and better. But Donald Trump not supporting people with [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=37.2s)]
*  emergency aid who lost their lives and lost their life savings or lost their shelter or lost their [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=44.64s)]
*  homes because of devastating hurricanes. You don't get much more low than that actually when [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=53.84s)]
*  it's Donald Trump. There's really no depth to his depravity. North Carolina voted for Donald Trump. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=60.16s)]
*  Georgia voted for Donald Trump. Former President Biden immediately activated FEMA when it came [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=67.44s)]
*  to the national emergencies in both of those states over and over again. No questions asked [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=74.56s)]
*  and supported those states relentlessly. Only for Donald Trump to go into those states and lie [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=80.64s)]
*  and claim that FEMA was stealing. Remember what Trump said during the campaign? That he would make [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=87.36s)]
*  FEMA so much better that during his term FEMA was the greatest thing ever. And he said FEMA was [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  stealing the money from the people of North Carolina and Georgia and elsewhere and giving [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=97.44s)]
*  it to illegal aliens is what he said. And then Donald Trump convinced his supporters, and this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=102.72s)]
*  was echoed on state regime media known as Fox and all the propaganda that FEMA wasn't giving money [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=108.0s)]
*  to people and that FEMA was just helping the migrants. And people believe that and then voted [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=114.64s)]
*  for Donald Trump. Take a look right here at the letter that Donald Trump just sent to the governor [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=120.08s)]
*  of North Carolina, Governor Josh Stein, where Trump says, quote, it has been determined that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=125.36s)]
*  the increased level of funding is not warranted in an emergency caused by a hurricane. This is [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=131.04s)]
*  the official letter from FEMA to Governor Stein. This is in response to your February 20th, 2025 [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=140.72s)]
*  request for an extension to the cost share waiver under major disaster FEMA-4827-DR that was [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=148.0s)]
*  declared on September 28, 2024 due to Tropical Storm Helene. You specifically requested an [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=157.44s)]
*  extension of the 100% federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=163.68s)]
*  including direct federal assistance for an additional 180 days. On September 25, 2024, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=169.68s)]
*  the federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=177.04s)]
*  federal assistance was increased to 100% for 180 days from the start of the incident period [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=182.24s)]
*  pursuant to the statute. And then it goes on to say on December 6, 2024, the federal cost share [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=189.52s)]
*  for all categories of assistance, including direct federal assistance was increased to 90% [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=196.0s)]
*  of total eligible costs except for assistance previously approved at 100%. This cost share [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=201.84s)]
*  adjustment is for the lifetime of the disaster based on our review of all, by the way, that was [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=207.76s)]
*  all under former President Biden. Based on our review, the Trump regime's review of all information [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  available, it has been determined that the increased level of funding you have requested [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=219.04s)]
*  for a major disaster is not warranted. Therefore, I must inform you that your request for an extension [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=223.92s)]
*  of the period of 100% federal funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=230.16s)]
*  including direct federal assistance for an additional 180 days is denied. Doesn't that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=237.28s)]
*  look awfully similar to the letter? By the way, from when the request was made by North Carolina, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=244.08s)]
*  February 20, 2025, they're now getting a letter April 11, 2025. Doesn't exactly sound like [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=251.2s)]
*  government efficiency to me, and it also feels retaliatory and the height of cruelty. I mean, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=258.72s)]
*  what do you think a federal government's supposed to do? I guess for Donald Trump, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  it's make people suffer and boost his ego. This is the role of the federal government. And by the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=270.64s)]
*  way, Georgia got a letter like this February 12, 2025, similar letter. Dear Governor Kemp, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=276.32s)]
*  this is in response to your January 2025 request for an extension to the cost share waiver under [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=282.96s)]
*  major disaster relief, FEMA- the same thing, on September 30, 2024, due to Hurricane Helene. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=289.6s)]
*  It goes and talks about how Biden approved it for 180 days. It's now expired. And then Donald Trump [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  says that he's denying it. Your request is therefore denied. And it goes and says that right [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=303.68s)]
*  there. We're going to closely monitor it, but it is hereby denied. Now, I just want to refresh [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=309.92s)]
*  your recollection here about what went down. So when Donald Trump was in these various states, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=316.56s)]
*  and he was talking about FEMA spending their funds on things like here's part of Donald Trump's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=324.32s)]
*  campaign speech where he says, FEMA was great under the first Trump administration. We had [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=330.48s)]
*  tremendous success. Then he attacks Biden. Let's play this clip. Everything will be beautiful once [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=336.32s)]
*  they take office. Everything's good. They spent all their funds. They have no funds to take care. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=342.0s)]
*  They have no funds. They have no workers. They have no nothing. FEMA, we had such a good FEMA. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=350.0s)]
*  FEMA was great under Trump. That I can tell you. We had tremendous success. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=356.8s)]
*  You're smart enough to know when something's not working, like when you can't focus at work, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=361.84s)]
*  or when you're dragging by 2 p.m., or when your stomach feels like it's fighting you after every [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=366.4s)]
*  meal. Well, here's the thing. These aren't random symptoms. Your gut impacts everything from your [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=371.04s)]
*  digestion to your brain function to your energy levels. That's why we love Just Thrive Probiotic. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=376.72s)]
*  Unlike other brands that make big promises but fall apart in your stomach, Just Thrive is the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=383.68s)]
*  only probiotic clinically proven to arrive in your gut 100% alive. For you, that means real results, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=389.12s)]

*  But don't just take our word for it. Try Just Thrive Probiotic for 90 days and see how much [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=401.84s)]

*  This is what Donald Trump said when he was in North Carolina in October of 2024. He says, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=429.76000000000005s)]
*  FEMA is not supposed to be spending the money on taking it out and illegal, on spending it on [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=436.48s)]
*  illegal migrants. Play this clip. Probably less FEMA because FEMA just hasn't done the job. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=441.04s)]
*  And we're looking at the whole concept of FEMA. I like, frankly, the concept when [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=447.2s)]
*  North Carolina gets hit, the governor takes care of it. When Florida gets hit, the governor takes [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=451.6s)]
*  care of it, meaning the state takes care of it. To have a group of people come in from an area [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=456.8s)]
*  that don't even know where they're going in order to solve immediately a problem is something that [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=462.88s)]
*  never worked for me. But this is probably one of the best examples of it not working. And there's [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  been some others, like in Louisiana, et cetera. So we're going to be doing something on FEMA that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=473.68s)]
*  I think most people agree. I'd like to see the states take care of disasters. Let the state take [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=480.64s)]
*  care of the tornadoes and the hurricanes and all of the other things that happen. And I think you're [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=485.52s)]
*  going to find it a lot less expensive. You'll do it for less than half, and you're going to get a [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=491.2s)]
*  lot quicker response. So that seems to be the recommendation, but we'll be making that recommendation [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=495.92s)]
*  over the next couple of weeks. We're going to go to- A reporter asked Trump in North Carolina [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=501.6s)]
*  on October 21, 2024, how an armed man was arrested for threatening FEMA workers [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=507.12s)]
*  because Donald Trump's lies were activating MAGA people to terrorize FEMA workers. And here's what [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=513.84s)]
*  Trump said, play this clip. President Trump, my armed gunman was arrested, charged with making threats [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=520.48s)]
*  against FEMA workers two Saturdays ago. FEMA had a safety stand down because of these incredible threats. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=527.76s)]
*  Is it helping the recovery up in North Carolina to keep making these claims that FEMA's not doing [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=534.88s)]
*  their job? Well, I think you have to let people know how they're doing. If they were doing a great [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=539.76s)]
*  job, I think we should say that too, because I think they should be rewarded. But if they're [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=544.08s)]
*  not doing, does that mean that if they're doing a poor job, we're supposed to not say it? These [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=547.76s)]
*  people are entitled to say it. And these are honest people behind this. If FEMA were doing well, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=552.48s)]
*  they would be saying they did a good job. They're not, for the most part, political people. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=557.04s)]
*  For the most part, they're not political people. But you've obviously seen nothing but, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=561.92s)]
*  you know, very bad statements coming out about the job that FEMA and this administration has done [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=567.92s)]
*  having to do with this area, North Carolina as a whole. And by the way, other states also, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=572.56s)]
*  they're also complaining. But look, a lot of the money is gone. They don't have any money. They [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=577.8399999999999s)]
*  have to have a meeting in Washington, a special meeting in Washington to get money. It's all gone. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=582.8s)]
*  They've spent it on illegal migrants. Many of them are murderers. Many of them are drug dealers. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=588.16s)]
*  Many of them come out of mental institutions and insane asylums. And many of them are terrorists. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=595.36s)]
*  And they spend money to bring these people into our country. And they don't have money to take [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=602.24s)]
*  care of the people from North Carolina and other states. So, you know, I think you have to be able [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=607.2s)]
*  to speak. Does that mean let's not talk about it? Because by doing that, they'll do a better job [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=612.72s)]
*  the next time. It's very important. Yeah, one more question. And now let me also show you some [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  receipts. This is what Governor Kemp said when he was asked about, this is in response to Hurricane [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=623.2s)]
*  Helene, where Governor Kemp is asked about, this is when Biden was in office, did Biden give you a [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=632.16s)]
*  call? Did Biden reach out to you? Because Trump was lying and saying Biden refused to call Kemp. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=640.8s)]
*  Here, play this clip. So I just spoke, the president just called me yesterday afternoon. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=645.6s)]
*  I missed him and called him right back. And he just said, hey, what do you need? And I told him, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=652.16s)]
*  you know, we got what we need. We'll work through the federal process. He offered that if there's [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  other things we need just to call him directly, which I appreciate that. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=663.0400000000001s)]
*  And here's the former governor of North Carolina, Governor Cooper, letting former Vice President [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=667.0400000000001s)]
*  Harris know when she was in the area, the amount of support that the Biden administration gave to [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=673.44s)]
*  North Carolina. Play this clip. Well, Madam Vice President, we are so glad to see you and welcome [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=679.52s)]
*  you once again to North Carolina. This has been an unprecedented disaster for our state. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=685.36s)]
*  But what you are seeing, thanks to you, the Biden-Harris administration, state and local officials, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=692.96s)]
*  volunteers, private organizations, this has been a massive unprecedented response. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=701.36s)]
*  We are deeply grateful for the federal resources that we have. FEMA has been on the ground with us [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=708.48s)]
*  since the very beginning of this. So we look forward to briefing and giving you details about [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=716.48s)]
*  the significant progress that's happening and all that we have to do. Unfortunately, we have 68 [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=724.32s)]
*  people who've lost their lives, but people are still working hard in search and rescue to save [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=731.12s)]
*  people and to surge resources into Western North Carolina. So thank you for being here. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=737.92s)]
*  Thank you. And remember on January 24th, 2025, a few days into the Trump regime, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=743.92s)]
*  Donald Trump visited North Carolina and this is what he said about FEMA. Let's play this clip. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=750.4799999999999s)]
*  So that's the only thing I can say. And certainly you have all heard the same stories that we all [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=755.5999999999999s)]
*  hear that FEMA has done a very poor job. Our FEMA, when we had a problem, we did record [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  rescues and the job that FEMA did under the Trump administration was really incredible. But [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=767.92s)]
*  they had spent, in all fairness to FEMA, they had spent hundreds of millions of dollars doing [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=776.16s)]
*  other things, things that I don't think bear any relationship to this money. They were not supposed [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=782.16s)]
*  to be spending the money on taking in illegal migrants, maybe so they could vote in the election [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=787.92s)]
*  because that's a lot of people are saying that's why they're doing it. I don't know. I hope that's [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=793.28s)]
*  not why they're doing it. So they really didn't have any money. They don't have very much money. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=796.96s)]
*  And now they're saying, can we have a special vote? Let's have a special session. I'm in favor of [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=801.6s)]
*  that. But somebody has to get back to why did they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=808.32s)]
*  something that they were not supposed to be spending it on? Okay. And from that visit, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=815.84s)]
*  Donald Trump then said, they don't need FEMA to come in all of these states like Florida and [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=820.8000000000001s)]
*  others. You don't need FEMA, he said. And he goes, it should be the states that take care of it. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=826.32s)]
*  Here, play this clip. FEMA is a very expensive organization that really doesn't work out very [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=831.6800000000001s)]
*  well. It hasn't. This is not the only example. So it was up to me right now. It ended right now. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=837.6800000000001s)]
*  And I just let the state take care of the problem. I mean, you can always have problems. Let the state, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=844.4000000000001s)]
*  if it's Florida, it's a hurricane. Let Florida take care of it. They don't need FEMA to come in. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=849.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, the whole thing is that FEMA works with the states. That's the way it works. This is not [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=854.3199999999999s)]
*  government efficiency. This is government cruelty, inflicting pain and suffering on North Carolina. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=860.0s)]
*  And by the way, the North Carolina, Georgia, you voted for Trump. You voted for a guy [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=864.8s)]
*  who took away emergency disaster assistance for debris removal, who's gutting your social [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=873.12s)]
*  security and your Medicaid, who's cruelly firing veterans, who's cruelly destroying the federal [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=881.2800000000001s)]
*  government and getting rid of essential services that you need. You literally are voting. I mean, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=887.5200000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying all the people in North Carolina. There's a lot of people who voted Democrat in [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=892.96s)]
*  North Carolina and Georgia as well. But the state voted Trump. I think about all those people who [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=896.6400000000001s)]
*  are voting against someone who goes, yeah, you don't deserve disaster assistance. Yeah, you don't [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=903.0400000000001s)]
*  deserve your Medicaid. Yeah, die. This is a sick regime, this Trump regime. Cruel, cruelty. You [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vup7ZXTzm7Q&t=908.72s)]
