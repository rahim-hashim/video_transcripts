# Trump has DISASTER Monday AM as SHOCK SETS IN
**MeidasTouch:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw)
*  Donald Trump returned to Washington DC. It was absolute chaos and mayhem this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=0.0s)]
*  Initially, the markets opened and started to tank more than we've really ever seen in modern [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  history. Then there was some unfounded rumor that Donald Trump was going to be pausing the tariffs [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  for a 90-day period. The stock market then shot up very quickly. Then the Trump rapid response team [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=20.56s)]
*  said fake news and then the market began to crash again. Normally on these videos I would put up [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=28.32s)]
*  where the market is, but right now it is going down, up, down, up. The volatility is so [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=35.28s)]
*  unprecedented in its nature, not the way a stable market is supposed to look. I don't want to even [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=44.72s)]
*  share it because in five, 10 minutes after I post this video or a half hour after it's posted, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=50.96s)]
*  it may look entirely different. Suffice to say, I think, to be a responsible reporter in this moment. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=56.08s)]
*  I need to say it is just absolutely chaotic with volatility like we've never seen before. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=62.16s)]
*  When I have a bigger snapshot, I'll of course report on what that is, but I don't want to in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  this moment in any way cause signals that could be problematic in any way. But let me just share [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=74.24s)]
*  with you what happened as we all woke up to the opening of the market. It officially became the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=80.24s)]
*  worst three-day performance of the S&P 500 since October of 1987 with the S&P falling more than 20% [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=86.8s)]
*  from its February closing high on pace to confirm a bear market. Here was the moment where [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  there was this unfounded rumor about this 90-day tariff pause to which the Trump response team said, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=104.72s)]
*  wrong, fake news. You'll see here this account, Unusual Wells, which covers the market says, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=112.32s)]
*  this is absolute comedy. I wouldn't really refer to it as that. The market was blood red today. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=120.24s)]
*  Then an unattributed rumor was starting on X that there was consideration of a 90-day tariff pause. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=125.52s)]
*  The market turned green. Then five minutes later, the White House denied the rumor. The market [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=131.92s)]
*  became red again. Then Donald Trump posted that he was going to impose additional tariffs on China [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=137.28s)]
*  and not have any further discussions with China. It would basically mean if you add up all the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  tariffs on China over 100%. Donald Trump posted, Yesterday China issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=150.64s)]
*  on top of their already set record setting tariffs, non-monetary tariffs, illegal subsidization [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=159.84s)]
*  of companies. Then it goes on and on and on. And then it says, therefore, if China does not withdraw [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=165.84s)]
*  its 34% increase above their already long-term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  the United States will impose additional tariffs on China of 50% effective April 9th. Additionally, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=177.52s)]
*  all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated. Negotiations [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=184.64s)]
*  with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=190.16s)]
*  Thank you for your attention to this matter. This would bring the tariffs to China above 100%. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=194.72s)]
*  You see right here this cartoon. I always think these political cartoons encapsulate the moment. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=200.32s)]
*  Trump on Fifth Avenue shooting the economy. Also, as Axios reported over the past few days, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=206.24s)]
*  we talked about this when the Trump tariffs were initially announced, which he calls Liberation Day. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  We refer to it as Recession Day, Annihilation Day, Great Depression Day, Liquidation Day. You [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=220.88s)]
*  pick your name. The Trump tariffs were based on a massive error in just the underlying formulation. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=227.12s)]
*  What Axios went on to report is how this conservative think tank shows that the formula [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  that was applied was incorrectly applied. Also, as we've said before, the tariffs are not reciprocal [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  despite the Trump regime referring to these as reciprocal tariffs. He made up the numbers that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=249.36s)]
*  he claimed were the tariff rates against the United States based upon the deficit with specific [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  countries. A country like Vietnam, when you calculated the deficit, Trump would include [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=263.2s)]
*  the delta and the deficit as part of what he considered to be a tariff against the United [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=269.92s)]
*  States. Countries like Vietnam and Cambodia and others would be viewed as being high tariff rates [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=276.56s)]
*  against the United States, even though the US was getting cheap products from those countries. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  The Orange Monday is the new Black Monday. That's at least when the markets were opening. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=290.16s)]
*  You may be seeing billboards like this across the United States that are being paid for by Canada [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=296.8s)]
*  and others. Tariffs are a tax at the gas pump. Tariffs are indeed a tax. That's what they are. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=302.24s)]
*  Tariffs are taxes on the American consumer. The American consumer is ultimately going to be the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  one to pay for this. The American consumer is paying this volatility, the hit that our 401Ks [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=313.2s)]
*  and retirements have been taking. This is not the way the markets are supposed to work at all. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=321.12s)]
*  You can tell even here, when you've lost your CNBC MAGA host, this is the CNBC MAGA host right here. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=327.2s)]
*  You'll just see that they're pissed. Play this clip. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=335.44s)]
*  I think from policy institutes on both sides of the aisle, the methodology that was used [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=338.48s)]
*  has been universally derided as being non-serious. I don't know whether you know exactly who came up [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  with the formula, but it allowed you to at least characterize most of these countries as being [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=352.24s)]
*  their tariffs well above the reality of the situation. When you say that we're going to do [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=359.68s)]
*  half on them, it was much higher than anyone anticipated. I think you'd have to concede that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=365.44s)]
*  this was not the market reaction you were looking for. There's a way of maybe incrementally trying [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=373.04s)]
*  to accomplish some of the things that the president wants to do in a reasonable, serious way. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=379.36s)]
*  This just almost across the board has caused what you're seeing in the stock market and a lot of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=384.96s)]
*  head scratching and head shaking on whether anyone really knows what they're doing in this case, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=391.36s)]
*  Peter. Can you acknowledge that? Sure. No, I can't because here's what I'm seeing. You throw a lot [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=396.32s)]
*  of stuff at me. First of all, the methodology was perfectly sound. It was done by the Council of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=402.48s)]
*  Economic Advisors based on long-term studies that are in the academic literature. The people taking [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  pot shots at us are the same people that always take pot shots. The American Enterprise Institute, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=412.8s)]
*  Peter. Of course. Of course. The American Enterprise Institute. Then you had Kevin [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=417.68s)]
*  Hassett, Donald Trump's top economic advisor, was going on Fox. You see the market there on the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=424.88s)]
*  right. At least that was the snapshot in time. Then here, Kevin Hassett talks about, he's being [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  asked about a pause on the 90-day tariffs. Here's what he says, play this clip. Will you do a 90-day [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=438.56s)]
*  pause? Would you consider that? Or Bill? Yeah. I think that the president is going to decide what [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=445.6s)]
*  the president's going to decide. There are more than 50 countries in negotiation with the president. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=450.72s)]
*  We've got the prime minister of Israel coming today. We've had a reach out overnight from Taiwan. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=455.44s)]
*  But I would urge everyone, especially Bill, to ease off the rhetoric a little bit. The fact is [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  that say 10% baseline tariff is on 14% of GDP. That's about how much trade we have, how many [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=469.12s)]
*  imports. 86% of GDP is affected by the deregulation and the tax cuts and everything else. Even if you [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=478.72s)]
*  think, and I think a lot of us at the White House think that these economic responses are exaggerated [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=486.24s)]
*  by critics, even if you think that there will be some negative effect from the trade side, that's [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=492.24s)]
*  still a small share of GDP. The idea that it's going to be a nuclear winter or something like [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=496.32s)]
*  that is completely irresponsible rhetoric. It was based on that where he didn't say that there [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=500.8s)]
*  would be a pause on the 90-day tariffs. It was incorrectly, erroneously reported that there was [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=505.92s)]
*  a pause, which was just false information. Take a look. Did you watch 60 Minutes recently? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=511.44s)]
*  60 Minutes found that there was no criminal record for 75% of the Venezuelan migrants that [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=519.52s)]
*  US sent to El Salvador. Yes, 75%. We've been highlighting a lot of those stories here on the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=526.0s)]
*  Midas Touch Network. People who just had autism awareness tattoos or people who had tattoos of [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=534.08s)]
*  Real Madrid, a soccer club or this story particularly is of significance today as [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=542.16s)]
*  there was a major ruling by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=549.76s)]
*  Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man, migrant, who in 2019, an immigration judge during the Trump [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=554.48s)]
*  administration said that he had a protected status here and could not be sent to El Salvador. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=563.04s)]
*  No criminal history at all, never committed a crime. Working in Maryland would check into ICE [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=569.52s)]
*  regularly. The Trump regime kidnapped him, sent him to the El Salvador concentration camp. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=575.2s)]
*  The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that he be immediately confirmed the district court [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=584.32s)]
*  order saying you need to return him immediately by midnight. Donald Trump is appealing the Fourth [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=591.36s)]
*  Circuit ruling to the Supreme Court. It was a particularly powerful ruling by the Fourth Circuit [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=598.48s)]
*  Court of Appeals affirming what the district court said. Get this guy back to the United States. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=605.6s)]
*  He had protected status. He's not a criminal. You can't kidnap people and send him to concentration [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=610.88s)]
*  camps. This is the ruling from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. It says the following, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=616.4s)]
*  The panel unanimously agrees that the district court's order requiring the government to [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=622.4s)]
*  facilitate and effectuate the return of Plaintiff Kilmore Armando Abrego Garcia [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=626.88s)]
*  to the United States by no later than 11.59 p.m. on Monday, April 7, 2025, should not be stayed. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=631.68s)]
*  The government's motion to stay is therefore denied. I write to explain my view. The United [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=638.48s)]
*  States government has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=643.36s)]
*  States off the street and remove him from the country without due process. The government's [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=649.76s)]
*  contention otherwise and its argument that the federal courts are powerless to intervene [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=654.56s)]
*  are unconscionable. Donald Trump immediately appealed that to the Supreme Court. That's where [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=659.52s)]
*  we stand right now. I'll give you more updates, of course, as I get more data. Thanks for watching [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSkUq66uqw&t=664.16s)]
