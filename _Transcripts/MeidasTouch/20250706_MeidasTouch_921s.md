# ðŸš¨ Trump DOJ makes SHOCK CLAIM about Trump DARK PAST
**MeidasTouch:** [July 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk)
*  So the Trump regime is now claiming that the Epstein list does not exist. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=0.0s)]
*  On Sunday night, Axios got their hands on a DOJ memo which claims there was never an Epstein list, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=5.26s)]
*  that Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex trafficker, did not keep a list that he used to blackmail powerful rich men. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=13.26s)]
*  And they also claim in this DOJ memo that there is no evidence that Jeffrey Epstein was murdered [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=22.9s)]
*  or that anything happened to Jeffrey Epstein other than he died by suicide. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=30.299999999999997s)]
*  And we all know that the DOJ and the FBI are made up of people who had been saying for years [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=35.9s)]
*  that this Epstein list was going to expose everything. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=43.4s)]
*  But of course, it seems that they are covering up for Donald Trump, who would be all over [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=46.4s)]
*  the Epstein files. So here's the headline from Axios, exclusive. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=52.7s)]
*  DOJ, FBI conclude Epstein had no client list, committed suicide, died by suicide. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=57.2s)]
*  But what about from February 21st, 2025, when Attorney General Pam Bondi says the Epstein client list was, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=64.9s)]
*  sitting on my desk right now, which she was reviewing along with the JFK and MLK files. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=74.19999999999999s)]
*  So the Epstein list went from sitting on Pam Bondi's desk right now in February to, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=81.5s)]
*  quote, there's no list in just a few months. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=87.5s)]
*  The official White House account, Rapid Response 47, back on February 21st, 2025, posted this, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  Fox, the DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=100.8s)]
*  Will that really happen? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=106.1s)]
*  Pam Bondi, it's sitting on my desk right now to review. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=108.0s)]
*  That's been a directive by President Trump. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  That's from the official Rapid Response account of the White House. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  Here was Pam Bondi in February saying that the client list was on her desk. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=118.7s)]
*  So you can hear it and see for yourself. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=123.4s)]
*  The DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=125.4s)]
*  Will that really happen? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=129.9s)]
*  It's sitting on my desk right now to review. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=131.4s)]
*  That's been a directive by President Trump. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=134.5s)]
*  I'm reviewing that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=136.9s)]
*  I'm reviewing JFK files, MLK files. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=137.70000000000002s)]
*  That's all in the process of being reviewed because that was done at the directive of the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=141.0s)]
*  president from all of these agencies. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=144.5s)]
*  So have you seen anything there? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=146.3s)]
*  You said, oh my gosh. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=147.9s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=150.4s)]
*  Okay, well, we'll check back with you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=152.5s)]
*  Now, we at the Midas Touch Network were able to get the first interview [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=154.5s)]
*  with Alex Eisenstadt, the reporter from Axios, who got this incredible [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=158.9s)]
*  exclusive. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=164.3s)]
*  Here's what Alex told us. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=165.3s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=166.9s)]
*  Hello, Alex Eisenstadt from Axios here tonight. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=167.9s)]
*  At Axios, we have an exclusive report. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=173.0s)]
*  The DOJ says it has no evidence to suggest that disgraced financier convicted [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=175.9s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein kept a client list, blackmailed any of his clients, or that he was murdered. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=184.0s)]
*  We have obtained a memo that was written by the DOJ and the FBI explaining these findings. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=193.6s)]
*  Further, the FBI and the DOJ are releasing video footage from out that it says is from [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=201.6s)]
*  outside Jeffrey Epstein's jail cell the night he was killed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  The FBI and the DOJ have released this footage in two different versions. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=212.9s)]
*  One is in raw footage version. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=218.1s)]
*  The other is in sort of enhanced version. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=220.1s)]
*  They say that this footage and it can be viewed yourself that it shows that there was no one [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=223.8s)]
*  that murdered Jeffrey Epstein when he was killed in 2019. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=230.4s)]
*  So that's the reporting that we have tonight up on Axios. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=236.8s)]
*  This is a really interesting thing for a couple of different reasons. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=241.5s)]
*  One, the FBI is led by Cash Patel, Dan Bongino. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=246.2s)]
*  And before they were at the FBI, both of them were really important conservative influencers, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=251.3s)]
*  MAGA type influencers, activists, and people who were very aggressive in terms of promoting [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=258.4s)]
*  the idea that there was some broader Epstein related conspiracy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=265.4s)]
*  Now that now that they're in government, they've tamped down a lot of how they speak [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=271.2s)]
*  when it comes to Epstein. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  They're now throwing cold water on the idea that there was ever such a conspiracy. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=279.09999999999997s)]
*  Another reason why this is interesting is because a lot of the people who have propagated [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=284.9s)]
*  this idea that there was a conspiracy are actually in Trump's orbit beyond just Bongino [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=290.7s)]
*  and Patel. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=295.46s)]
*  A lot of the conspiracy theories have emanated from sort of the more right leaning part of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=296.56s)]
*  the internet. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=303.76s)]
*  And now you have the Trump administration kind of pushing back on that and saying, no, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=306.06s)]
*  there's no evidence of a conspiracy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=312.35999999999996s)]
*  Now do you all remember back in, was it February, where the MAGA influencers all went to the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=315.64s)]
*  and they were holding up the binders that said the Epstein files, phase one. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=322.82s)]
*  Remember that there were going to be multiple phases and they all said, here's the list. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=328.82s)]
*  We've got the list. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=332.62s)]
*  And it wasn't the list. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=333.82s)]
*  It was just a call list of Epstein, by the way, which Donald Trump's name was on. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=334.82s)]
*  We shouldn't forget what Elon Musk said in the past few weeks. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=342.22s)]
*  Remember what Elon Musk wrote? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=345.72s)]
*  That is the real reason they have not been made public. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=352.92s)]
*  Have a nice day, DJT. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=357.12s)]
*  Mark this post for the future. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=359.62s)]
*  The truth will come out. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=361.62s)]
*  Well, here we are right now in the future. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=363.42s)]
*  And the Trump regime seems to be suppressing these files. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=366.42s)]
*  And as I've said before, we know that Donald Trump is on all of the files that have been [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=370.32s)]
*  released to date. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=375.42s)]
*  He's on Epstein's flight log at least seven times. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=376.82s)]
*  Trump is in the depositions of Epstein sex trafficking victims. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=380.92s)]
*  For example, there's a deposition where a victim says that she was with Epstein on the plane [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=384.92s)]
*  and Epstein said, let's go to Atlantic City. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=390.42s)]
*  And then Epstein called Donald Trump in her presence. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=392.82s)]
*  Also, we know that Donald Trump is identified as DOE 174 in the Epstein civil cases and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=395.62s)]
*  other cases. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=402.82s)]
*  And so if we wanted to get the Epstein files with Trump's information, we would say produce [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=404.02000000000004s)]
*  the records relating to DOE 174, who's Donald Trump. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=408.92s)]
*  Also at the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal trial, she was the sex trafficker for Epstein. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=412.52s)]
*  There was a woman, someone who's now a woman at the time, was a girl, 14 years old, and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=418.92s)]
*  said that Ghislaine and Epstein introduced her to Donald Trump when she was 14 years [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=425.32s)]
*  old and a girl. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=430.82s)]
*  We also know that Virginia Joufray, who died by suicide, was trafficked from Mar-a-Lago. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=432.22s)]
*  She was homeless. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=441.02s)]
*  She got a job in Mar-a-Lago when she was underage. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=442.22s)]
*  And then Ghislaine found her at Mar-a-Lago, brought her to Epstein to give Epstein a massage. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=445.52s)]
*  And then that led to the sex trafficking of Virginia Joufray after that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=451.12s)]
*  After then she was sexually assaulted and then she was sex trafficked by Epstein. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=457.42s)]
*  But she was found at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=461.02s)]
*  And of course, Donald Trump said Epstein's a great guy who likes women on the younger side. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=463.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, here we have this video of Donald Trump partying with Epstein so you can just see for yourself. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=468.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, here this speaks volumes. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=473.71999999999997s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=475.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to get great ratings on your show. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump is surrounded by women as music flares in the background. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  After a while, Trump goes to greet three new guests, among them the financier Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  More than a decade before his guilty plea on state prostitution charges. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=490.82s)]
*  Later in the footage, Trump is seen talking to Epstein and another man as women are dancing in front of them. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=495.82s)]
*  Trump alternates between dancing and pointing out women to Epstein and the other men and telling Epstein about the cameras. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=501.82s)]
*  Though exactly what they say is difficult to understand as they discuss the women and their appearances, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=510.82s)]
*  Trump gestures to one and appears to say to Epstein, look at her back there. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=517.82s)]
*  She's hot. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=523.4200000000001s)]
*  And then Trump says something else into Epstein's ear that makes him double over with laughter. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=526.72s)]
*  But as the president says now, he never liked Epstein. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=534.0200000000001s)]
*  OK, then you may remember what Cash Patel said a little bit longer than a month ago regarding the Epstein files. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=538.12s)]
*  He said the reason that it's being delayed is that they need to get it out in the right format. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=546.02s)]
*  Remember this? Let's play this clip. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=551.3199999999999s)]
*  The other thing on the Internet is the Epstein files. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=552.92s)]
*  What's the answer to that? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=556.02s)]
*  The answer to that is the same as everything else. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=558.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to withhold information from the American public ever, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=561.42s)]
*  but I'm also not going to rush to get it out there in a format in which they can't rely on it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=566.42s)]
*  So on the Epstein matter, any other matters, we are diligently working on that. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=571.7199999999999s)]
*  And it takes time to go through years of investigations, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=575.72s)]
*  years of political maneuvering and years of cover up to get the American people what they deserve. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=580.82s)]
*  And that's what I'm going to give them on everything. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=585.72s)]
*  Now, do you remember when Donald Trump was still campaigning and he was asked by Fox [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=588.32s)]
*  if he would release the Epstein list? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=594.12s)]
*  Remember how terrified he looked? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=595.9200000000001s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=597.4200000000001s)]
*  Would you declassify the 9-11 files? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=598.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=601.22s)]
*  Would you declassify JFK files? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=601.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=603.62s)]
*  I did. I did a lot of it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=604.62s)]
*  Would you declassify the Epstein files? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=605.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I would. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=608.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=610.22s)]
*  I guess I would. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=610.72s)]
*  I think that less so because, you know, you don't know. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=611.62s)]
*  You don't want to affect people's lives if it's phony stuff in there [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=614.62s)]
*  because it's a lot of phony stuff with that whole world. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=617.22s)]
*  But I think I would. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=621.32s)]
*  Now, let's also not forget a few weeks back what Pam Bondi said about the Epstein client list. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=622.62s)]
*  This was about two or three months ago. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=628.82s)]
*  Here's what she said. Play this clip. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=630.62s)]
*  I was briefed on that yesterday. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=632.22s)]
*  I can't talk about that publicly, but, you know, President Trump has given a very strong directive, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=634.12s)]
*  and that's going to be followed. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=639.32s)]
*  Wow. Okay. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=640.52s)]
*  So a lot of documents. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=641.62s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=643.12s)]
*  All right. So people can expect actual movement on this. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=644.02s)]
*  It's not just empty promises. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=646.22s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't make empty promises. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=648.12s)]
*  I think promises made, promises kept. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=651.32s)]
*  Now, you'll also recall that I exclusively interviewed Democratic Congress member [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=653.42s)]
*  Dan Goldman in mid-May where he was calling out Pam Bondi [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=657.92s)]
*  for stonewalling the release of the Epstein files. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=662.52s)]
*  Here's what he told me. Play this clip. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=665.3199999999999s)]
*  And so there was a mad dash and a big rush to release everything, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=667.3199999999999s)]
*  and everyone was talking about it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=671.42s)]
*  And now there's radio silence and the begs the question. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=673.22s)]
*  Why has the Attorney General gone dark on this? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=678.02s)]
*  Why has Congresswoman Luna and others stopped calling for it? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=682.8199999999999s)]
*  What is it that's in the Epstein files that they were so eager to have [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=687.9200000000001s)]
*  that now are just not being released according to the Attorney General's promises of transparency, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=693.9200000000001s)]
*  but are still there? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=701.12s)]
*  And there's no explanation. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=704.32s)]
*  And the concern I have, of course, is we know Donald Trump had a friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=707.12s)]
*  We know Jeffrey Epstein had numerous numbers for Donald Trump. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=714.12s)]
*  And the question then is, was this some sort of directive from Donald Trump [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=718.52s)]
*  or someone on his staff or an agent of his to the Attorney General to kill this? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=723.42s)]
*  And that would be yet another pretty egregious act of corruption [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=729.72s)]
*  using his position as president for his own personal benefit. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=736.12s)]
*  It is incumbent upon the Republicans currently in the majority, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=740.92s)]
*  to do their damn job, do their job and conduct oversight over the president of the United States. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=744.02s)]
*  Stop sucking up to him so much. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=750.92s)]
*  And then, of course, back on March 4th, 2025, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=752.92s)]
*  Bondi said that there was a truckload of evidence relating to the Epstein case. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=755.8199999999999s)]
*  And then we should also not forget that was a few months ago as well. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=761.02s)]
*  Bondi then tried to blame the SDNY, Southern District of New York, prosecutors and DOJ and FBI there, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=765.22s)]
*  for not turning over the files. Here's what she had to say. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=773.92s)]
*  I want to get into this Epstein thing a little bit. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=776.8199999999999s)]
*  I think the American people are very curious about who's on this list or these lists. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=778.8199999999999s)]
*  You have been doggedly trying to get all the information. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=784.02s)]
*  And now we learn, thanks to you, that you've been stonewalled by people in New York. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=787.7199999999999s)]
*  Do you want to explain that? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=794.8199999999999s)]
*  Yes, Mark. So, as you know, we released about 120 pages of documents. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=797.42s)]
*  And I started asking for these documents right when I came into office and before Cash Patel was in there. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=803.62s)]
*  So I ended up getting about 120 pages. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=810.92s)]
*  We carefully redacted them, of course, to be sure the 254 young girls, women who are victims of sex crimes and sex trafficking, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=814.52s)]
*  their personal information was redacted and out of there to protect them. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=825.42s)]
*  So I'm going through it and I kept saying there has to be more. There has to be more. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=829.52s)]
*  I'm assured that's it. Cash asked the same questions. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=832.82s)]
*  Assured there's no more. Last I found out, you know, this week that a source told me New York, SDNY, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=836.32s)]
*  they're sitting on thousands of pages of documents regarding Epstein. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=844.5200000000001s)]
*  Thousands, thousands. And of course, you've seen the very strong letter. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=849.5200000000001s)]
*  We will get everything. We will have it in our possession. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=854.0200000000001s)]
*  We will redact it, of course, to protect grand jury information and confidential witnesses. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=857.82s)]
*  But the American people have a right to know. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=864.5200000000001s)]
*  And Donald Trump is the most transparent president in our nation's history. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=866.82s)]
*  So not only will America get the full Epstein files, they will get JFK. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=871.22s)]
*  They will get Martin Luther King. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=875.72s)]
*  So, folks, a lot of information right there to process. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=877.4200000000001s)]
*  But the Trump regime and the DOJ saying the Epstein files do not exist, never existed. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=880.32s)]
*  Epstein never blackmailed powerful men who were also involved in the sex trafficking ring. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=886.52s)]
*  That's what they're going with right now after saying they were going to release the files. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epy1RM3AvBk&t=892.52s)]
