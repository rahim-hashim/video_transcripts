# Trump FREAKS OUT Bad as MASSIVE BRIBES Surface
**MeidasTouch:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA)
*  In normal times, impeachment would be the worst of the worries of a vile and pathetic president [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=0.0s)]
*  who engaged in the behavior that is happening in our plain view. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=8.0s)]
*  The felon, the fraud, the sexual abuser. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump is bragging on social media about getting a $400 million gift from Qatar [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  in the form of a 747 jet with gold-plated walls, gold-plated toilets, gold-plated beds. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=23.92s)]
*  Not just for Donald Trump to now use as Air Force One. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  Can we say massive security threat and massive security breach? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=38.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, as part of this gift, Donald Trump gets to keep the 747 after he leaves office [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=42.96s)]
*  as part of his hypothetical presidential library. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=50.08s)]
*  So just a $400 million at least. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=54.0s)]
*  I think that's understating a gift from Qatar directly to Donald Trump to use as Air Force One. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=57.44s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=65.36s)]
*  If that doesn't make you pissed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=67.44s)]
*  Well then Donald Trump goes around and says, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  We've fixed inflation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=73.2s)]
*  Everything is great. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=75.04s)]
*  Prices are so much lower. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=76.64s)]
*  Aren't you rich now? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=78.72s)]
*  Don't you feel great again? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=80.56s)]
*  No, Donald. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=82.64s)]
*  You're a scammer. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=83.68s)]
*  You're a punsy schemer. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=84.8s)]
*  And what you're doing with your trade war against the world, reckless and careless, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=86.64s)]
*  going around and disparaging the United States' reputation across the world [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=92.64s)]
*  while enriching yourself is obvious for all to see. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=100.08s)]
*  Take a look, Donald Trump's posting about it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=102.8s)]
*  Here was his post last night. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a gift free of charge of a 747 aircraft [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=107.12s)]
*  to replace the 40-year-old Air Force One temporarily in a very public and transparent transaction [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=114.24s)]
*  so bothers the crooked Democrats that they insist we pay top dollar for the plane. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=121.2s)]
*  Anybody can do that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  The Dems are world class losers. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=130.24s)]
*  MAGA. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=133.68s)]
*  As our editor in chief Ron Filipkowski writes, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=134.56s)]
*  Trump's quote, very public and transparent transaction on the Qatar jet grift [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=137.84s)]
*  only came to light after confidential sources told ABC and others about it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=144.8s)]
*  So Donald Trump then needs to distract from the fact [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=152.16s)]
*  that he's done another deal to enrich himself. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=155.76s)]
*  And by the way, we could get into it as well. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=158.8s)]
*  In addition to the $400 million plane, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=161.68s)]
*  Donald Trump is building resorts in Qatar. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=164.56s)]
*  Donald Trump is building resorts in Oman paid for by the Saudi Sovereign Wealth Fund, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=167.84s)]
*  the Abu Dhabi Sovereign Wealth Fund using $2 billion of Trump crypto. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=173.84s)]
*  Donald Trump Jr. creating a club called the Executive Branch, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  which costs $500,000 to join, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=184.56s)]
*  which Don Jr. leads with the quote, unquote, crypto czar, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  a guy named David Sachs, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=192.0s)]
*  and they throw parties at five-star hotels for access. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=193.84s)]
*  With all of that going on, how is Trump going to distract? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, his next one is claiming that he is lowering prescription drug prices [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=202.4s)]
*  by 30% to 80% based on price controls that he is unilaterally implementing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=208.4s)]
*  So here's what went down yesterday. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=218.32s)]
*  First, he posts the following, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=220.0s)]
*  My next truth will be one of the most important and impactful I have ever issued. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  Enjoy! Exclamation point. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=228.56s)]
*  And by the way, we should not ever neglect how Orwellian is to call his lies truths. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=230.64s)]
*  I just want to point it out there. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=237.84s)]
*  And then he sends this big blob of a paragraph. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=239.68s)]
*  I'll go through some of it, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=242.4s)]
*  which he basically says that he's going to implement something called an MFNA, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=243.68s)]
*  Most Favored Nations Clause against pharmaceutical companies. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=249.44s)]
*  He says that if a pharmaceutical company is selling a drug at a price that is lower [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=254.16s)]
*  than in the United States, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=261.04s)]
*  that pharmaceutical company has to do that not just abroad, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=262.72s)]
*  but also in the United States. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=266.72s)]
*  Now, in theory, that is great. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=268.88000000000005s)]
*  In practicality, Donald Trump said he was going to do that in 2020, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=272.24s)]
*  but did not do that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  And rather than addressing, I think, the systemic issue first of making sure there is access to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  health care, ensuring universal health care that everybody gets the best health care, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  What I see is this is another gimmick where Donald Trump, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  via an unlawful executive order, is going to do more Ponzi scheme, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=294.96s)]
*  more rug pulling, where his people believe, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=300.96s)]
*  Oh my God, if I just wait a little longer, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=304.4s)]
*  30% to 80% off my prescription drug prices, that's going to be incredible. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  I think that would be incredible. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  Like, let's be real. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=315.84s)]
*  I think that Trump is a vile, fraud, felon, sexual predator. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=317.28s)]
*  He is all of those things. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  If he got 30% to 80% reductions in prescription drug prices and health care costs, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=323.2s)]
*  I would celebrate that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=330.32s)]
*  That would be incredible and a massive accomplishment. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=332.23999999999995s)]
*  But what Trump is doing with price controls via an executive order [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=335.67999999999995s)]
*  is he's dangling hope and carrots in front of his base that's never going to actually occur, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=339.91999999999996s)]
*  but they think it is, and then he's just going to drag it out, drag it out, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=346.88s)]
*  and blame others for not achieving it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=350.48s)]
*  So let me just show you what it is that he posted. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  He goes, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=355.2s)]
*  For many years, the world has wondered why prescription drugs and pharmaceuticals [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=356.32s)]
*  in the United States of America were so much higher in price than they were in other nations. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=360.32s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=364.64s)]
*  Sometimes being five to 10 times more expensive than the same drug, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=365.76s)]
*  manufactured in the exact same laboratory or plant by the same company. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=369.36s)]
*  I agree. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=373.04s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=373.52s)]
*  It was always difficult to explain and very embarrassing because, in fact, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=374.64s)]
*  there was no correct or rightful answer. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=378.47999999999996s)]
*  So stipulated. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=380.47999999999996s)]
*  I agree. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=381.44s)]
*  But pause there. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  Then why did all of these MAGA groups and right-wing groups sue former President Biden [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=383.52s)]
*  when he tried to implement policies to reduce prescription drug prices? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=390.8s)]
*  Why did your people, your MAGA Republican leaders, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=395.76s)]
*  block this stuff from being implemented if you're being genuine? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=400.56s)]
*  But go on. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=403.52s)]
*  He goes on to talk about how he's going to implement these price controls, he says, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=404.56s)]
*  by implementing a most favored nations clause, he says. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=411.52s)]
*  And he goes, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=415.68s)]
*  Prescription drug and pharmaceutical prices will be reduced almost immediately by 30% to 80%. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=416.64s)]
*  They will rise throughout the world in order to equalize. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  And for the first time, bring fairness to America. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=427.2s)]
*  I will be instituting a most favored nations policy. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=430.24s)]
*  By the way, do I think that if you can reduce prescription drug prices [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  and make them lower in America than they are in the rest of the country, it would be great. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=438.64s)]
*  The MAGA Republicans are the people who say that they're against price controls. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=443.52s)]
*  All of this stuff is price controls. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=448.72s)]
*  My view is if you want to repair our health care system, you have universal coverage, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=452.24s)]
*  you make health care a human right, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=458.4s)]
*  you make it accessible and affordable. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=461.35999999999996s)]
*  The reason why health care costs are cheaper in the rest of the world is because mostly [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=463.67999999999995s)]
*  all other countries other than the United States have a form of universal health care [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=469.67999999999995s)]
*  where the prices are low because the government negotiates with the health care providers. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=475.2s)]
*  If you want to enter the market, you have to pay, you have to make your drugs cheaper. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=482.08s)]
*  That's what, let me be very clear, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=487.52s)]
*  that's what President Biden did to have the government negotiate down Medicare prices. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=490.24s)]
*  He wanted to do that across the system and the Trumpers voted against it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=497.68s)]
*  It's why I know this is a gimmick and it's just one of those things where he goes, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=503.12s)]
*  I'm going to try to do it 80%. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=507.68s)]
*  And what's the timing of this? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=509.52s)]
*  The timing of this is the cutter jet. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=511.6s)]
*  So Trump wants to distract from his $400 million jet. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=514.72s)]
*  Look what I'm doing. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=518.8s)]
*  I'm going to get you 80% off. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=519.8399999999999s)]
*  And the problem is it's not true and people are going to hold out hope [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=522.0s)]
*  and it ain't going to happen, although I hope it happens. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=525.8399999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about this other, I think, big piece of news from the weekend. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=528.4s)]
*  Although I think it is important that we always have to look at what the details are [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  with everything and then we have to also ask what is the policy behind it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  So there were two days of negotiations between the United States and China. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=543.92s)]
*  Over the 145% tariffs that the United States imposed on China [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=548.88s)]
*  and America imposed tariffs on the rest of the world as well. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=554.4799999999999s)]
*  After day two, the United States issued kind of two different statements. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=558.7199999999999s)]
*  One from Treasury Secretary Scott Besson, who said substantial progress was made. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  Then the United States Trade Representative Jameson Greer [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=569.52s)]
*  said that there was actually an agreement reach. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=573.5999999999999s)]
*  Separately, China's Commerce Department and their lead negotiator in China [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=576.24s)]
*  described that there was some consensus that was formed to lead to other talks. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=581.12s)]
*  We'll see what develops today. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=587.6s)]
*  But here's my overall question. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=590.8s)]
*  The Trump regime says that tariffs are amazing, that they're incredible, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=594.16s)]
*  that everybody's going to get rich. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=599.76s)]
*  That's why over the past, you know, whatever, since that liquidation or great recession day, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=601.92s)]
*  which Trump calls Liberation Day, he said that solves everything. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  We get rich. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=612.0s)]
*  So I'm just trying to be logical here. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=613.12s)]
*  If tariffs are great and makes everybody rich and everything's amazing, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=616.0799999999999s)]
*  then why would they be negotiating in Switzerland to remove the tariffs? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=621.1999999999999s)]
*  And why is the media referring to this as a deal when it is simply Donald Trump [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=626.72s)]
*  removing either all or some or pausing the problem that he created? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=633.84s)]
*  We need to speak accurately on these events and stop acting like these are some [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=640.32s)]
*  five-dimensional chess deals when it's Trump as the arsonist creating the fire. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=646.24s)]
*  Everybody recognizes it's a fire. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=653.44s)]
*  He puts out some of his own fire. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=655.68s)]
*  That's not a deal. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  It's not a comprehensive trade policy at all. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=659.68s)]
*  And if you want to just take a look, for example, at what the S&P looks like over the past year or so, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=662.88s)]
*  you'll see that it is still trading down. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=670.4s)]
*  Still, overall, with all of this, that's not what winning looks like. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=673.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=677.52s)]
*  And if we remove and pause the tariffs, what was the point of doing all of this? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=679.04s)]
*  Stopping the ships, stopping containers from getting here, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=684.8000000000001s)]
*  causing longshoremen jobs and truckers jobs. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=687.9200000000001s)]
*  Americans suffered because of this. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=692.0s)]
*  Americans are suffering because of this. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=695.28s)]
*  Inflation is not going down. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=698.0s)]
*  Inflation is going up. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=699.6800000000001s)]
*  The economy is not doing good. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  The economy contracted in the first quarter. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=703.2s)]
*  What was this for? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=705.6s)]
*  Oh, lots of market manipulation so the rich can get richer [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=706.64s)]
*  and the rest of Americans can get screwed over in this chaos. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=710.64s)]
*  And amongst all the chaos, Trump and his oligarchs can feast and exploit we the people. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=714.24s)]
*  As I've said before, keep this simple. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=721.6800000000001s)]
*  If setting aside if you're a Democrat, an independent, whatever, keep it simple. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=724.88s)]
*  Americans are getting screwed over by a decade millionaires and oligarchs [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=729.92s)]
*  and people who want to hoard their wealth. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=737.52s)]
*  If you are working a job, you should be paid with dignity. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=742.64s)]
*  You should be able to afford a home. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=747.04s)]
*  And you should not be worried that you're going to get kicked out, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=750.0s)]
*  that you can't pay your rent. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=753.52s)]
*  To me, that's what we should be focusing on. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=755.1999999999999s)]
*  Rather than gimmicks of I'm issuing an executive order on health care, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=757.8399999999999s)]
*  we should make sure every American has health care, that health care is cheap. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=762.3199999999999s)]
*  When it comes to education, education should be a right. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=766.0799999999999s)]
*  Every American should get top-notch education. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=769.1999999999999s)]
*  Nazi A Trump regime cut education and cut libraries and cut universities [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=771.92s)]
*  and cut things that really matter to help people. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=777.92s)]
*  I'm not okay with that. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=781.52s)]
*  And we should feel safe when we get on an airplane. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=783.04s)]
*  We should feel safe in our country. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=786.24s)]
*  We shouldn't have to hear stories like this. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=788.4799999999999s)]
*  Breaking a new air traffic control equipment outage was at Newark again. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=791.36s)]
*  FAA advisories showed the ground stop lasted for about 45 minutes. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=796.64s)]
*  This comes after a 90-second long radar and radio outages on May 9th and April 28th. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=801.04s)]
*  And I don't want to see a public servant. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=808.56s)]
*  That's what a president is, a public servant. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=812.7199999999999s)]
*  The word is servant in there. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=816.16s)]
*  Serve the people. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=818.48s)]
*  That's your priority. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=819.5999999999999s)]
*  Doing deals with country after country. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=821.1999999999999s)]
*  The Trump-branded projects have 20 open or in-progress deals with various countries [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=825.44s)]
*  across the world to enrich Donald Trump. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=833.12s)]
*  Donald Trump and his family got over $4 billion richer over the past 100 days. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=836.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, they've destroyed the lives of veterans. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=844.0s)]
*  They've destroyed the lives of hardworking Americans. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=848.72s)]
*  They've ripped apart our government. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=851.9200000000001s)]
*  And now we have to wait till what, hurricane season, and then find out that FEMA's understaffed. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=854.64s)]
*  We have to see other natural disasters take place only for the Trump regime to deny emergency [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=862.32s)]
*  relief like we saw in red states and blue states. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=869.12s)]
*  We're going to have to see a budget prepared where Medicaid gets cut and people can't [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=872.48s)]
*  access health care. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=877.12s)]
*  But I'm glad that I'm being sarcastic here that Donald Trump gets a golden 747 airplane [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=878.32s)]
*  paid for by Qatar. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=887.92s)]
*  We're going to have to what? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=892.08s)]
*  In a normal times, you would have to rip that plane apart, check for bugs. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=893.04s)]
*  Do you think they're going to do that? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=897.52s)]
*  No, because Donald Trump doesn't even think it's a big deal when his Department of Defense [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=898.88s)]
*  head, Secretary of the Department of Defense Pete Hegseth, is having conversations about [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=905.76s)]
*  classified information on Signal. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=912.0s)]
*  And they don't think that's a problem. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=915.04s)]
*  And there's at least 20 other communications like that taking place that we know of while [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=916.64s)]
*  Predator drones are getting shot down over Yemen, while two F-18s were lost in the Red Sea. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=922.4s)]
*  That's the status here. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=930.24s)]
*  Let's keep this conversation simple. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=931.84s)]
*  And that's what we try to do here at the Midas Touch Network each and every day. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=934.96s)]
*  Thank you so much for watching. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjWQWB0PkWA&t=939.0400000000001s)]
