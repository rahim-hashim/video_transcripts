# Fox News LOSES CONTROL on LIVE TV as Trump GOES NUTS
**MeidasTouch:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU)
*  State regime media known as Fox is in panic mode as the tables are being turned against it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=0.0s)]
*  By people who you would think could be their biggest supporters. Maybe maybe not [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene Tucker Carlson and all this MAGA media is out there Matt Gaetz [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=11.96s)]
*  They're saying Fox is state regime media Fox is propaganda media [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=19.04s)]
*  It's coming from Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz here watch this play this clip [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=24.92s)]
*  We've watched for decades propaganda news. I'll call out Fox News and the New York Post [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=29.68s)]
*  They're known to be the neocon network news [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=34.88s)]
*  we have propaganda news on our side just like the left does and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  The American people have been brainwashed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=42.08s)]
*  Into into believing that America has to engage in these foreign wars in order for for us to survive and it's [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=44.88s)]
*  Absolutely not true [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=53.6s)]
*  And then the day before you had Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon calling Fox quote news [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=54.88s)]
*  State regime media and propaganda and then Tucker Carlson even does my Mark Levin impression [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  That's my impression Tucker. I did the Mark Levin first here play this clip. So what is that? That's not by popular acclaim [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=68.64s)]
*  That's not like their viewer surveys like you know, we need a lot more Mark Levin less Jesse Waters more Mark Levin [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=75.68s)]
*  What they're doing is what they always do [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=80.72s)]
*  Which is just turning up the propaganda hose to full blast and just trying to you know [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=83.84s)]
*  Knock elderly Fox viewers off their feet and make them submit. This is this and by the way on [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=90.64s)]
*  State regime media known as Fox their guests are talking about [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=96.92s)]
*  How many views the Midas Touch Network is getting on YouTube? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=102.68s)]
*  Midas Touch Network is getting on YouTube [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=107.12s)]
*  Yeah, they're talking about Midas Touch on Fox and the guests are saying [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=110.04s)]
*  California governor Gavin Newsom is out maneuvering you Fox's guests are saying that you're being out maneuvered by Newsom [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=114.14s)]
*  Because he goes on Midas Touch who gets 22 million views every other day play this clip [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=120.4s)]
*  What's interesting about what he's doing is not just what he's saying, but where he is saying it [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  He had an exclusive on the Midas Touch Network with his address the nation with 2 million people [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=128.74s)]
*  Seeing that Midas Touch is getting 22 million views every two days [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=133.96s)]
*  He had Brian Tyler Cohen a youtuber into the emergency operations center to do an interview [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=136.96s)]
*  It just shows that I think he's learning the lessons candidly of 2024 that Democrats didn't do enough to communicate more to independent media [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=141.0s)]
*  Which I think is exciting Wow, and then here's Mark Levin on Hannity last night [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=147.46s)]
*  Then they really had their kind of neocon war mongering [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=152.72s)]
*  This looked just like the lead-up to the war in Iraq and they're doing it again [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=157.72s)]
*  They're bringing out the same cast of characters [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=163.5s)]
*  Mark Levin was on Sean Hannity and here's what he has to say play this clip [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=166.2s)]
*  Gee and we have morons fools running around the country. This isn't magna [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=170.96s)]
*  This isn't magna. This isn't what I voted for [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=177.24s)]
*  Donald Trump is a forever war president. How so? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=180.24s)]
*  He's gonna do it every president before him since Carter didn't have the guts to do [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  He's gonna put an end to this damn thing and that's what needs to happen. That's not a warmonger [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=188.29999999999998s)]
*  That's a peacemaker that is a man is gonna make sure this generation and future generations are [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=193.54s)]
*  Protected from nuclear missiles coming out of the Middle East from barbarian primitives from the seventh century [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=200.54s)]
*  That's what he wants to do then earlier in the day you had Larry Kudlow [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  This is why they're called state regime Larry Kudlow worked in the first Trump regime and the first administration [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=212.22s)]
*  and here you have Larry Kudlow and Tommy Tuberville and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=218.78s)]
*  They're not even reporting the news [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=223.94s)]
*  I mean you just have Kudlow on Fox saying Donald Trump is the greatest person ever [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=225.94s)]
*  Donald Trump is so amazing. Donald Trump is so powerful. He's got all of the cards. You've got all of the cards Donald [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=231.62s)]

*  It's not Xi Jinping is Trump Trump holds the cards in his hand and he knows how to play him [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=255.06s)]
*  That's what's happening here. I've pretty much I've been around a long time. You've been around a long time [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=260.66s)]
*  Never seen anything like it. He is utterly dominant senator in Tarpavel by the way [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=265.18s)]
*  That's what they were then doing the whole day you then have senator Haggerty who goes on Fox and he goes look [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=269.78s)]

*  Whatever he does it's going to be putting America's interests first [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=289.85999999999996s)]
*  It's going to be bringing Iran to a point where they do not have a nuclear weapon [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=292.9s)]
*  That's the stated objective and it's gonna have to happen very very quickly [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=297.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean Trump is literally the biggest moron in the world. I mean the guy is the biggest idiot [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=300.1s)]

*  Donald Trump is so smart and you see what an idiot this guy is and all of the disasters he's causing it's like [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=314.90000000000003s)]
*  Is your mind just become full maga mush here you had Fox with Ted Cruz remember [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=322.74s)]
*  Donald Trump called Ted Cruz's wife incredibly ugly and Donald Trump said that Ted Cruz's dad killed JFK [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=329.86s)]
*  But here he's the main guest promoting Trump last night Fox now displaying [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=337.38s)]
*  Educational graphics on how bombs work to their audience [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=342.82s)]
*  encouraging the USB to bombers to hit [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=347.26s)]
*  Iran and here Ted Cruz says if Iran gets a nuclear weapon [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=350.90000000000003s)]
*  I think the odds are high that we would find out with a mushroom cloud over New York City [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=355.7s)]
*  Again, now this is the same language that they used about Iraq play this clip [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=362.94s)]
*  You need an ICBM to get to America if is if Iran gets a nuclear weapon [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=367.3s)]
*  I think the odds are unacceptably high that we would find out with a mushroom cloud over New York City or Los Angeles [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=373.1s)]
*  Or Tel Aviv and Israel. No, let me be very clear where I stand. I believe Iran is [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=379.82s)]
*  Iran should never ever have a nuclear weapon. Okay. I believe Iran is led by an extremist Ayatollah regime [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=387.3s)]
*  I think that Iran would be far better off with a [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=394.64s)]
*  regime that focused of course on democracy on the people and you know those images that you saw before [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=400.1s)]
*  The revolution in the late 1970s, you know the images of Iran being a major [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=406.7s)]
*  Metropolitan center with women's rights and and and human rights. I would love to see that. Okay [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=412.66s)]
*  I just think it is important that we have a clear delineated plan about what we are doing [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=419.18s)]
*  War powers are the province of our Congress not dictators and I don't want to see a protracted war [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=425.42s)]
*  Call me naive. I don't want to see a protracted war in the Middle East that will result in the deaths of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  Thousands or tens of thousands of American troops like we saw happen in Iraq. I don't want to see that happen in Iran [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=441.34000000000003s)]
*  Okay, you topple the Ayatollah. What happens next? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=448.46s)]
*  You're gonna have groups that are allied with the Shah come back in you're gonna have groups that are allied with [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=451.78000000000003s)]
*  Far-right [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=459.26s)]
*  Terroristic extremist groups and I think you'll have a civil war. It's not like Iran's gonna be like oh, hey Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=460.86s)]
*  Hey, you tell us who should lead Iran. We want Benjamin Netanyahu's pick that ain't gonna happen in Iran [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=468.21999999999997s)]
*  You think that's gonna happen in Iran. So what happens after you topple the regime? What happens next by the way? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=474.42s)]
*  Speaking of flipping the script on Fox and its guests then you had Tucker bring Ted Cruz on the Tucker show [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=481.74s)]
*  Watch Ted Cruz get obliterated on Iran by Tucker play this clip. How many people live in Iran, by the way? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=488.44s)]
*  I don't know the population at all. No, I don't know the population [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=494.92s)]
*  You don't know the population the country you seek to topple [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  How many people living around 92 million, okay [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=504.24s)]
*  Yeah, how could you not know that? I [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=507.32s)]
*  Don't sit around memorizing population tables. Well, it's kind of relevant because you're calling for the overthrow of the government [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=510.76s)]
*  What why is it relevant whether it will be because 90 million or 80 million or a hundred million? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=516.64s)]
*  What why is that? I don't know anything about the country. I didn't say I don't know anything about okay. What's the ethnic mix of Iran? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=520.6s)]
*  They are Persians and predominantly Shia, okay [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=526.84s)]
*  You don't know anything about Iran. So okay. I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=531.16s)]
*  You're a senator who's calling? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=537.16s)]

*  You know, I'm not saying that who can't figure out a good idea to kill General Soleimani [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=546.0s)]
*  You said it was bad. They're trying to murder Trump. Yes, I guess you're not calling for military strikes against them in retaliation [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=550.56s)]
*  They really believe that carrying out military strikes today. You said Israel was right with our help [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=556.48s)]
*  I'm said we Israel is leading them, but we're supporting them [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=561.56s)]

*  Then you have Brian Kilmeade and Fox and you you it literally bringing the exact cast of characters who told us about [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=742.8s)]
*  WMDs in Iraq so here we have you you it saying that nope the war powers act of Congress is [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  Unconstitutional go for it. Donald be a dictator. That's what they were promoting play this clip. So what role should Congress play in this? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=758.9599999999999s)]
*  None I'm very disappointed to see my senator Tim Kaine. I'm a Virginian [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=767.4799999999999s)]

*  James Madison drafted which vested all commander-in-chief power in the president of the United States [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=777.76s)]

*  It's been honored in the breach by people like President Obama [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=789.78s)]
*  President and Biden who have both committed forces and withdrawn forces without congressional approval [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=792.0799999999999s)]
*  There's usually a little bit of a of a dance that a president doesn't send them a notice that they've done something [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=797.3199999999999s)]
*  But it's simply ridiculous the president is the commander-in-chief if he orders the b2s to fly from Diego Garcia or wherever [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=803.2800000000001s)]
*  To strike fordo. It's within his complete authority to do so and mr. Massey is not a Republican [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=810.1600000000001s)]
*  He's an irritant and he should not be held up as representing anyone in the Republican Party [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=816.3000000000001s)]
*  I doubt you'll find one Republican other than him who denies the president's power to do this if he chooses to do so [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=821.96s)]
*  Then you you it talks about we have also sent a nuclear sniffing aircraft in the event [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=828.4s)]
*  Radioactive material is released but Donald Trump is the greatest peacemaker in history. Okay play this clip [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=835.28s)]

*  Hope so [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=847.04s)]
*  I think the all the signals indicate that [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=847.8s)]
*  His last meeting in the situation room was a confirming meeting that he will join Israel in striking at least fordo as well [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=850.76s)]
*  As any other parts of the nuclear program in Iran that cannot be reached by Israeli munitions [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=858.4s)]
*  I believe the b2s can get there. We also have sent the nuclear sniffing [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=864.38s)]
*  Aircraft over there in the event that there's any release of radioactive material from fordo after its bomb [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=869.12s)]
*  I hope he does [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=873.9599999999999s)]
*  I think it will secure his place in history as a peacemaker [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=874.88s)]
*  Because after the nuclear program is dismantled and he has said for ten years they may not have a nuke [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=877.64s)]
*  He said it last night. He said it ten years ago when he came down the escalator [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=883.84s)]
*  He've been consistent. They may not have a nuke after it's destroyed [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=887.72s)]
*  He'll go into the history books is a great peacemaker. Then Fox has Lindsey Graham talking about regime change [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=891.76s)]
*  Let's play this clip right here. Arabia would like to see the theocracy gone [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=897.0s)]
*  I know the Emirates would and many other Arab states as well. But then there's the question of [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=900.52s)]
*  What happens if there is a power vacuum there? We saw all too well what happened in Iraq? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=906.8000000000001s)]
*  We saw what happened in Afghanistan when the Taliban took over and literally a matter of hours [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=911.96s)]

*  You've got the crown prince Reza Pahlavi [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=922.28s)]
*  Who would like to go in as an interim leader and the other side of that fence? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=924.56s)]
*  You've got the NCRI the National Council for Resistance in Iran, which used to be the Mek [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=928.48s)]
*  Which a lot of people in Iran say would be worse than the ayatollah. So what steps into the vacuum if the regime falls? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=934.68s)]
*  Well, I think what will happen is the Iranian people will know freedom for the first time since [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=941.68s)]
*  1979 you know people probably asked that about Hitler in the 30s [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=946.6s)]
*  What would happen in Germany if we took him out in the mid 30s? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=950.36s)]
*  Well, I wish we had because we know what happened when they let him stay in power and here's what I can say [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=953.84s)]
*  Taking the ayatollah's regime down is a good thing [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=959.88s)]
*  Not a bad thing and I'm willing to risk what happens next because I know what's going to happen if they stay in power [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVdnRbtuIU&t=963.92s)]
