# FATIGUED Trump is CRACKING as PRESSURE GROWS
**MeidasTouch:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE)
*  He looks beaten down. He looks utterly fatigued as he panicked posts throughout the day [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=0.0s)]
*  in his dumpster fire of a presidency. The worst ever post after post, oddity after oddity, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=6.88s)]
*  dangerous vile trash after dangerous vile trash. Posts like this yesterday. Rebuild an open [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Alcatraz. For too long America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=22.56s)]
*  The dregs of society then goes on to say, this is why today I'm directing the Bureau of Prisons [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=28.96s)]
*  together with the Department of Justice, FBI, Homeland Security to reopen a substantially [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  enlarged and rebuilt Alcatraz. That's what he's talking about. You know Donald Trump waste, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  fraud, and abuse that Alcatraz was something that was overly expensive and really wasn't [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  doing anything good. That's why it was shut down. It's part of the national park system right now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=55.04s)]
*  What are you doing talking about opening up Alcatraz? Oh, and then Donald Trump is posting [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=60.0s)]
*  photos of Alcatraz right now. Then Donald Trump posts the following. The movie tariffs on foreign [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=64.8s)]
*  movie production. That's what Donald Trump's thinking about. I don't even know how that would [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  work. It was when it arrives on the ship, when the movie arrives on the ship, Donald, he goes, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=76.72s)]
*  The movie industry in America is dying. That's all in caps. A very fast death. Our other countries [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=82.88s)]
*  are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=89.2s)]
*  Hollywood, and many other areas within the USA are being devastated. This is a concerted effort [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=94.72s)]
*  by other nations and therefore a national security threat, he says. It is in addition to everything [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=99.84s)]
*  else, messaging and propaganda. Therefore, I am authorizing the Department of Commerce and the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=107.12s)]
*  United States Trade Representative to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=113.28s)]
*  on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands. We want movies [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=121.04s)]
*  made in America again. In other words, if you make a movie in another country, 100% tariff, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=128.0s)]
*  how's that going to even work? When the director shows up back into the United States, you're [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=134.24s)]
*  going to tariff the director. What in the world is this guy doing? And then you have Howard Lutnick, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=138.88s)]
*  who some people refer to as Nutlick. Here's why. He goes, we're on it, as our editor in chief, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=145.52s)]
*  Ron Filipkowski, who coined the name Nutlick says, because of course he is. Donald Trump then posts, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  It is time for Howie Kurtz to retire. Every woke anchor in the business, people that no one watched [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=158.72s)]
*  from CNN, MSDNC and others are plastered all over his show with all really negative and fake [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=165.84s)]
*  statements. And then I am weakly defended by Howie and his group. Although Ben Dominick has been [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  strong, the case Howie makes for me is so pathetic that it would be a lot better if he didn't say [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=178.8s)]
*  anything at all. Anyway, that's the way it is. Also on Trump's social media platform, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=183.68s)]
*  lots of advertisements for Trump knives these days. Everywhere you look there, there's a Trump [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  knife for sale with Trump's name on it. Donald Trump then posts late last night, I don't need [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=194.24s)]
*  to have Karl Rove of Fox News tell me what to do. That guy's a total loser who's been wrong about [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=200.32s)]
*  almost everything. Now, of course, this follows Donald Trump posting AI images of himself as the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  Pope deeply offending the Catholic community and just anybody who has a shred of decency, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=212.96s)]
*  regardless of if you're Catholic or even regardless of your religious. It's like, what the hell are you [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=219.12s)]
*  doing, Donald? And then earlier today, the official White House account posted the following, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=223.84s)]
*  Donald Trump AI that looks nothing like him with bulging muscles and the red sith lightsaber. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=231.52s)]
*  And then they go happy May 4th to all, including radical left lunatics who want to to to they say [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=239.92s)]
*  to all over again, fighting hard to to bring sith lords, murderers and drug lords, dangerous [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=246.48s)]
*  prisoners and gang members to the U.S. Hey, Donald, you know you have the red sith lightsaber right [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=253.83999999999997s)]
*  there. So then then Donald Trump took a flight back from vacationing again on the taxpayer dime, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=259.76s)]
*  right? Donald Trump was in Mar-a-Lago partying it up lavish parties. There was an RNC spring [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=267.04s)]
*  retreat at Mar-a-Lago. So Donald Trump double dip in, triple dip in, quadruple dip in while he's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  doing deals with Qatar for Trump resorts while the Abu Dhabi fund is using Trump's crypto. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=280.88s)]
*  As you have Don Jr. doing clubs that are called the executive branch, $500,000 a member to join [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=289.28s)]
*  the executive branch with Dave Sachs. The cryptos are you have Donald Trump doing lavish parties [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  at Mar-a-Lago on the taxpayer dime where Trump's staff is being housed. And then you now have the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=304.32s)]
*  RNC spring retreat. So they're paying Donald Trump as well. A massive, massive grift going on there. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=311.36s)]
*  So Trump vacations, he comes back to Washington, D.C. and he spends his time on the flight back [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=317.76s)]
*  like attacking reporters, specifically the Wall Street Journal, because the Wall Street [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=323.44s)]
*  Journal's reporting on the failure of Trump's trade war against the against the world. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=328.48s)]
*  So here Donald Trump looks at the Wall Street Journal reporter and goes, you're rotten. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=333.92s)]
*  You're a rotten person. Your newspaper is rotten. Watch a severely demented and dangerous and vile [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=338.4s)]
*  Donald Trump attacked the Wall Street Journal reporter. Let's play it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=346.32s)]
*  Now, this is a line that Donald Trump's been repeating over and over again. It's one of his [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=376.32s)]
*  main talking points where he goes, little girls, beautiful little girls, he says, which is creepy [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=386.8s)]
*  in and of itself. He goes, I don't see why they want $35. They should have two dolls and they [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=392.08s)]
*  should pay more money for their dolls. And why do they want 250 pencils? Use five pencils. What [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=399.28s)]
*  are you doing? What are these little girls doing? You take your two dolls, you take your five [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=405.2s)]
*  pencils and you shut up little girls. So Donald Trump's been saying over and over again. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=409.44s)]
*  Here he is saying it on the flight last night. Play the clip. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=414.48s)]
*  Oh, listen, what I'm saying is that you don't have a young lady, a 10 year old girl, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=418.88s)]
*  nine year old girl, 15 year old girl, doesn't need $37. She could be very happy with two or [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=428.96s)]
*  three or four or five. I wouldn't, I wouldn't, let's not waste a lot of time. What else? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  And just so you see, I'm not making it up, but this is a talking point he repeats over and over [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=442.64s)]
*  again. Here he was on the Kristen Welker interview saying it as well. Play this clip. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=446.8s)]
*  Talk about the tariffs. And I want to ask you about something you said this week. Got a lot of [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  attention. You were at your cabinet meeting. You said, quote, I'm going to quote what you said. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=455.6s)]
*  Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. And maybe the two dolls will cost a [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=459.6s)]
*  couple of bucks more than they would normally. Are you saying that your tariffs will cause some [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=464.56s)]
*  prices to go up? No, I think the tariffs are going to be great for us because it's going to make us [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=470.48s)]
*  rich. But you said some dolls are going to cost more. Isn't that an acknowledgement that some [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=474.72s)]
*  prices will go up? I don't think a beautiful baby girl needs that's 11 years old needs to have [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=478.48s)]
*  30 dolls. I think they can have three dolls or four dolls. Because what we were doing with China [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=485.92s)]
*  was just unbelievable. We had a trade deficit of hundreds of billions of dollars with China. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=492.08000000000004s)]
*  When you say they could have three dolls instead of 30 dolls, are you saying Americans could see [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=497.92s)]
*  empty store shelves? No, I'm no, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying they don't need to have [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=503.76s)]
*  30 dollars. I can have three. They don't need to have 250 pencils. They can have five, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=508.24s)]
*  but you're basically saying there could be some supply shortage because of the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=513.6s)]
*  tear waste money on a trade deficit with China for things we don't need for junk that we don't need. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=518.08s)]
*  So on that flight last night as well, Donald Trump essentially was conceding that none of his [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=525.04s)]
*  trade negotiations were going well. So Donald Trump's new talking point, I want you to listen [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  to it very clearly here. What he's saying is even if I don't do any deals, I don't need to do deals. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=537.36s)]
*  He says, because I'll set the deals myself. He goes, I'll just look at the country and I'll say, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=544.88s)]
*  here's your number. Here's your number. And that becomes the deal. So why do I even negotiate? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=549.76s)]
*  Because I make up the number. He says here, listen to what he says. I don't need deals. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=556.08s)]
*  At the end, I'm setting the deal. I keep saying, what are you going to do? This is not like a big [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=586.1600000000001s)]
*  deal that's going to be signed. In some cases, we'll sign. We don't have to have to set. I'm [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=591.5200000000001s)]
*  going to be setting the deal. I'll be setting a tariff. You keep asking the same question. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=595.84s)]
*  When will you agree? It's up to me. It's not up to them. It's up to me now. They don't have to [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=600.72s)]
*  deal with us, which is OK, because we lost under Biden. We're losing five billion dollars a day. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  Think of it. Five billion dollars a day. Now we're not dealing with China at all because the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=611.68s)]
*  tariff is so high that they basically can't deal. But what he's most focused on now is the military [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=618.88s)]
*  parade on his birthday in June. It'll cost us at least a hundred million dollars, 50 helicopters, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=625.1999999999999s)]
*  paratroopers, 7,000 soldiers, Kim Jong-un style in Washington, D.C., tanks. This is what Donald [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  Trump wants to happen. Here he is talking to Kristen Welker about the military parade [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=640.88s)]
*  that he wants to have play this clip. The president also told me that next month [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=646.32s)]
*  he's planning a military parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army that also falls [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=651.04s)]
*  on his 79th birthday. We're going to have a big, beautiful parade. A military parade. Yeah, sure. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=658.8s)]
*  OK, we're going to celebrate our military. We have the greatest military people. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=664.32s)]
*  Uh, peanuts compared to the value of doing it. We have the greatest missiles in the world. We [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=668.88s)]
*  have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest army tanks in the world. We [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=675.28s)]
*  have the greatest weapons in the world and we're going to celebrate it. And lastly, I could keep [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=679.52s)]
*  going on, but you get the point. Here's Donald Trump telling Kristen Welker that he doesn't know [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=685.2s)]
*  if he needs to even follow the Constitution anymore. He goes, I don't even know if it applies [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=691.6s)]
*  to me is the reality. I don't know. And, you know, I don't think I need to follow any due process [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=696.24s)]
*  play this clip. Your secretary of state says everyone who's here, citizens and non-citizens, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZ8eDVnFOE&t=702.96s)]
