# PANICKED Trump Voters FREAK OUT over CRASHING ECONOMY
**MeidasTouch:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM)
*  Trump voters are regretting what they did, especially individuals in the market who are or who are looking at their [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=0.0s)]
*  pensions and 401ks right now or those in the investment community. You had people like Geiger Capital [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  who had previously posted no one other than [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=16.18s)]
*  fairly stupid partisans on the left think that Trump is truly going to implement [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=20.48s)]
*  20% tariffs on everything across the board. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=26.86s)]
*  Maybe didn't predict a hundred and forty five percent tariffs against China or whatever cockamamie formula they use and then Geiger Capital [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=30.12s)]
*  responded to their own post recently. I won't delete this tweet because I am a man of honor, but yes [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=37.24s)]
*  I was wrong on the tariffs in November. He has indeed put blanket tariffs on every country. Trump 2.0 is very different. Also [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=42.64s)]
*  seeing a lot of posts like this. I've lost [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=51.42s)]
*  $208,000 since Trump became the president. I should have voted for and of course the person can spell [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=54.26s)]
*  Kamala Harris's name correctly. It says Camilla [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=61.46s)]
*  other statements like this. It's no secret. I voted for Trump, but I didn't vote for a global trade war. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=64.62s)]
*  He better fix this strife immediately if Republicans want a chance to keep the House or Senate. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=70.25999999999999s)]
*  71 million Americans have a 401k. We are the world's largest consumers. Our trade deficits could have been ironed out with a phone call. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=75.66s)]
*  I believe this is a huge miscalculation. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=82.66s)]
*  Democrats should be jumping up and down tonight celebrating. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=85.42s)]
*  Actually, we're not jumping up and down celebrating. This is a horrible time generally for the country. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  I mean the pain that Donald Trump is inflicting other posts like this. I'm a small business in a small town. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=94.46s)]
*  99.9% of America's small businesses. We cannot survive the tariffs. I voted for Trump. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=100.78s)]
*  So don't come on here and calling me a liberal. I can go on and on and on. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=106.64s)]
*  Headlines like this market turmoil puts brosphere support for Trump under strain and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=111.17999999999999s)]
*  while as of we're recording this you never know with kind of the pump-and-dump meme coin [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=119.02s)]
*  economy that Donald Trump has turned our markets into so I want to be careful what I say, but as the markets are once again [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=125.46s)]
*  in a crash mode right now [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=132.7s)]
*  Donald Trump held a cabinet meeting and he talked about the big day. We had the prior day here play this clip [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=135.44s)]
*  Prescription drug prices are [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=143.76s)]
*  Even to down doing very well. It's it's been amazing. We had a big day yesterday. There will always be transition [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=146.2s)]
*  difficulty, but we had a [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  In history, it was the biggest day in history [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  The markets so we're very very happy with the way the country's running very happy with the way the country is running [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=159.6s)]
*  Let's call in Democratic Congressmember Jimmy Gomez Congressmember Gomez. He's very happy [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=167.72s)]
*  Very happy with it transition problem. Very happy with it. What's what's your response to that? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=173.56s)]
*  Well, it pisses me off. It actually makes me extremely angry because his his economic [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=178.84s)]
*  Plan if he wants to call it it has just been creating chaos one [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=184.84s)]
*  We always knew taking on having a trade war would be difficult [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=189.16s)]
*  Especially when you're picking a war with every single [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=194.28s)]
*  Country in the on the globe including your own allies [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=197.92s)]
*  That was that's insane [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=201.76s)]
*  I always he always said oh these are gonna be easy to win easy to win [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=203.68s)]
*  Not when the opposition starts firing back and that's what exactly started happening [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  And he just created a tailspin in the marketplace where you saw the stocks going down down and down [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=211.92s)]
*  You also saw the the consumer confidence crashing. Yes our bank started saying hey [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=217.44s)]
*  There's gonna be a recession recession recession and it just was a complete [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=223.6s)]
*  Chaos and what happens is you're starting to see it hurt really working men and women people that need to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=230.04s)]
*  Look at their receipt when they go to the grocery store or a restaurant [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=237.2s)]
*  They really need to buckle down and here's the thing those tariffs [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=240.72s)]
*  He lifted the big ones, but not all the all the tariffs [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=244.68s)]
*  So what you're gonna see is you're gonna see the inflation still go up people still hurt and and once that happens [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=248.2s)]
*  People start tightening their belts [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=254.52s)]
*  They stop spending that revenues decline and all of a sudden when revenues decline the small business owner starts cutting back on [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=256.2s)]
*  Hours and then laying off people so we're in a downward spiral [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=264.28s)]
*  It hasn't stopped just because he he paused it for 90 days [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=268.44s)]
*  the the bond [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=272.88s)]
*  market super bad like to an extent if you're if people are not scared they should be because they we were on the verge of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=274.76s)]
*  having a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  financial economic meltdown and this guy at the only reason he changed was because people were saying hey [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=284.64s)]
*  This is gonna bring down the entire economy [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=290.76s)]
*  So this guy is costing people their livelihoods or 401ks [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=292.72s)]
*  And I think that that's finally breaking through to the people that voted for him [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=297.04s)]
*  But this guy has no idea what he's doing. He listens to an economic advisor named Pete Navarro [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  Who made up an expert called Ron Vera to justify his positions? That's insane [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=308.16s)]
*  You run the lead the congressional dad's caucus, you know there were [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  Overall still in the last election a lot of you know men who voted for [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=321.52s)]
*  For for Trump, I mean, but you know men dads [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  You know are I mean all Americans but are feeling the pain [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=332.68s)]
*  What's your vantage point from the dad's caucus about what your you know about what you're seeing? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=336.52s)]
*  So the dad's caucus we started off. We only had six members now [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=343.28s)]
*  We're up to 45 members and it really is talking about the issues that men and families care about one [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  How do you survive? How do you actually earn enough? How do you make sure things are not going up and up? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=353.48s)]
*  How do you kind of provide and in a way? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=360.16s)]
*  Really kind of acknowledges people where they're at, you know, you're a dad. You're a mom you're struggling [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=363.92s)]
*  But we want to figure out how to make life easier for you [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=369.12s)]
*  and one of the things that we've known is that when we [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=372.68s)]
*  Talk to dads about raising a kid [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=376.35999999999996s)]
*  saving for a house [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=380.03999999999996s)]
*  Losing a job mental health we had people talk talk about mental health [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=381.88s)]
*  We'd have them talk about gun violence when you talk about issues that impact them [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=386.2s)]
*  They're more likely to have to listen to your other [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=390.96s)]
*  other policies, right but when you sit there and you kind of like [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=395.0s)]
*  Don't have that conversation. Don't treat them as a [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=399.55999999999995s)]
*  Valued part of your your coalition [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=403.12s)]
*  Well, then all of a sudden they start moving away from you and this appeals the Democrats caucus [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=405.72s)]
*  We have everybody who is up from a blue dog to a new dam to progressive members [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=411.38s)]
*  It's ideologically diverse racially diverse and geographically diverse [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=416.16s)]
*  It's one of the few caucuses that actually can do that because we start where people where people's parties are [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=420.44s)]
*  themselves and their families and a big part of that is health [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=427.08000000000004s)]
*  Making sure [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=431.44s)]
*  They're healthy. Their families are healthy. Their parents are healthy [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=433.2s)]
*  you know one of the things about this budget in addition the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=437.64000000000004s)]
*  Magga-republican Trump budget in addition to giving four point five trillion dollars in tax cuts to the billionaires is it's gutting Medicaid [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=441.64000000000004s)]
*  But they almost pretend that they're not doing it like it. Oh, not that it could even get worse [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=448.90000000000003s)]
*  But it does in the sense that then they're deceitful about like that's not what we're doing when they're doing it [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  Here's what speaker of the house? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=460.5s)]
*  Maga Mike Johnson said earlier today after pushing forward the Senate blueprint which by the way looks nothing like the house blueprint [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=461.74s)]
*  But they're just pretending that they're gonna go along with this until I guess what we hit a debt ceiling and then we're in another crisis [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=468.64s)]
*  Mode, but here's what Maga Mike says then I'll get your response to it all [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=474.5s)]
*  No one has talked about cutting one benefit in Medicaid anyone who's duly owed what we've talked about is returning work requirements [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=478.74s)]
*  So for example, you don't have able-bodied young men on a program that's designed for single mothers and the elderly and disabled [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=485.8s)]
*  They're draining resources from people who are actually do that [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=493.04s)]
*  So if you if you clean that up and shore it up [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=495.62s)]
*  You save a lot of money and you return the dignity of work to young men who need to be out working instead of playing video [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=498.2s)]
*  Games all day. We have a lot of fraud waste abuse in Medicaid. Just one one tiny example. The estimate is 51 billion dollars [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=504.12s)]
*  Congressman your response to that [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=512.02s)]
*  The Republican plan is really [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=513.76s)]
*  Defund defraud and lie to the American public and here's the defund. They're trying to cut Medicaid. They're trying to cut [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=516.76s)]
*  Social Security by by making it so hard for people to get their checks. They're trying to cut the Department of Education [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=525.4s)]
*  They're just trying to cut cut cut without giving a damn of who it's gonna hurt [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=532.76s)]
*  So that's the defund and then they want to take that savings and use it to defraud the American people by giving tax breaks [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=538.12s)]
*  To the top one tenth one percent the billionaires are ultra wealthy [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=544.88s)]
*  And making sure that the corporations get a lower tax rate as well [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=549.8s)]
*  That's how they're gonna defraud the American people and then they're lying about it. Here's the thing he said [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=553.4s)]
*  Oh, that's not what we're doing their own budget [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=559.4s)]
*  Instructions to the Energy and Commerce Committee says you have to cut [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=563.0799999999999s)]
*  880 billion dollars out of federal step spending. Well, they have jurisdiction over Medicaid [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=566.88s)]
*  Medicare and some other spending well [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=573.28s)]
*  The other spending is only you cut everything to the bone you get rid of it. You only cut 200 billion [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=575.6s)]
*  So where do you get the other 680 billion in savings that they need? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=581.28s)]
*  Medicaid yeah [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=586.24s)]

*  Working people but that only saves you about a hundred and hundred twenty billion dollars. So they're they're straight-up lying [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=593.64s)]
*  That's why I actually went to [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=600.8s)]
*  Valadeos representative Valadeos and Bakersfield district held a town hall. He has 67% of his district on [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=603.64s)]
*  Medicaid and he doesn't care and it's like that's because either you're lying about the math lying [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=611.4s)]
*  That you're gonna cut the deficit or you're just lying about your entire plan [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=617.0s)]
*  So they're defund defraud and lie strategy. We got to just expose and make people know what really is going on [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=620.8s)]
*  finally, I gotta ask you about this because la USD is in your [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=628.44s)]

*  Tried to question kids at two elementary schools in Los Angeles Monday what but were denied entry by administrators [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=648.08s)]
*  Superintendent Carvalho said the agents claimed they had parent permission to question the kids but it wasn't true [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=656.88s)]
*  Carvalho said the agents were seeking to talk to five children who came to this country as unaccompanied minors and are in the care of [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=662.76s)]
*  legal guardians [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=669.96s)]

*  You know, I would just made aware of the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=696.3199999999999s)]
*  Superintendent what happened la USD. It's extremely scary because this basically says that the Trump administration knows [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=699.4s)]
*  No bounds and and it has no dignity when it comes to dealing with even young children and as a dad [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM21hBP9BMM&t=707.04s)]
