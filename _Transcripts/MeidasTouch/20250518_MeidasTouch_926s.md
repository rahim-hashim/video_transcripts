# Trump SUFFERS Major DEFEAT in SHOCK Romania ELECTION
**MeidasTouch:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI)
*  Romania has spoken in their major presidential election. They have rejected the Trump and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=0.0s)]
*  Putin backed far right wing candidate George Simien. Instead, the pro-EU, pro-democracy [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=14.08s)]
*  centrist candidate who's currently the mayor of Bucharest, Nekusher Dan, is going to go [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=22.96s)]
*  on and win this election. 95% of the vote has been counted and Nekusher Dan is taking a [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=29.0s)]
*  commanding lead with 54% of the vote to George Simien's 45% of the vote. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=37.28s)]
*  Romania has spoken. They want closer ties within the European Union. They want democracy. They [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=44.24s)]
*  want to support Ukraine. This is a massive loss for Donald Trump and MAGA who supported [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  George Simien who modeled himself as Romania's Trump, as Romania's MAGA. This is a massive [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=57.36s)]
*  defeat for Vladimir Putin and for far right wing autocracies across the world. Now, George [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=64.96s)]
*  Simien modeled in the kleptocratic, despicable, vile model is not conceding. Instead, he's declaring [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=72.72s)]
*  victory despite losing. He has posted on social media in Trumpian fashion, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=82.08s)]
*  I am the new president of Romania despite losing. Now, this has also been amplified by RT, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=88.0s)]
*  the Russian propaganda network as well. But let's be very clear, Nekusher Dan is going to go on and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=96.16s)]
*  win this election. As I mentioned, the mayor of Bucharest, a centrist, a math Olympiad, has a PhD, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  a brilliant soft spoken man who supports democracy. Now, if you looked at the odds [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=109.84s)]
*  a few days ago, George Simien had a 75 to 80% chance of winning. After all, he won the first [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=116.16s)]
*  round of Romania's election back in early May. Then right before the elections were to take place, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=123.36s)]
*  we saw George Simien's odds of winning slide to about 54%. Two hours ago, there was a complete [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=132.24s)]
*  reversal. Now, you may be used to seeing the polling look like this, although it looked a [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=140.96s)]
*  little bit not as all of a sudden fashion like this. But when we showed you how the far right [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  wing party in Canada lost after leading in the polls, same thing in Australia, their far right [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  wing party lost after leading in the polls, more repudiation of MAGA, more repudiation of anyone [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=160.48s)]
*  who doesn't support Ukraine and any major repudiation to sympathizers of Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  Let's take you to the scene of Bucharest right here where the people are celebrating. Let's watch [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=175.83999999999997s)]
*  this. Let's play the clip. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=181.28s)]
*  So what happened in this election to lead Nacoucher Dan to go on to beat [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=196.24s)]
*  George Simien? How did the centrists pull off this upset right now? Well, there was a surge [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=202.96s)]
*  that we just saw today in Bucharest and other areas of young voters. They saw what happened [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=210.64s)]
*  in early May during the first round where although Simien didn't get a majority, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  Simien still got the leading vote total. And I think the young people said, our future [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=222.88s)]
*  is going to be absolutely destroyed by this MAGA Putin candidate. Romania will be lost [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=229.44s)]
*  to Putin. So you saw this surge of young people voting. You saw this record turnout that nobody [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=237.92s)]
*  expected to see in Romania. And this led to the centrist pro-democracy, pro-EU candidate pulling [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  off this important upset and an upset that was a further repudiation of Trump and Putin. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=255.2s)]
*  Let me show you how France 24 was talking about this election just days ago. Here's how they [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=261.36s)]
*  described George Simien from the AUR, the MAGA Putin candidate, the far right wing extremist. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=268.8s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=276.0s)]
*  Simien, that even though he has never been in government, he is fit to lead. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=291.36s)]
*  The AUR wants to remain in the European Union but has proposed cutting off military aid to Ukraine. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=302.72s)]
*  We need to take care of our own interests and of our own citizens. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  If the far right received 40 percent of the vote in the first round this month, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=314.8s)]
*  it's also thanks to Kalin Georgevsku. The anti-vaccine pro-Russian candidate won the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=319.2s)]
*  first round of elections in November before it was annulled. Now under investigation for campaign [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=325.84s)]
*  abuses, Georgevsku must report to the police once a week. Our next sponsor has been a game changer [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=332.56s)]
*  for my family and me. If you get nauseous, you absolutely must get our next partner, Relief Band. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=338.08s)]
*  Relief Band is the original anti-nausea wristband that quickly relieves and effectively prevents [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=344.56s)]
*  nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness, anxiety, migraines, hangovers, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=350.08s)]
*  morning sickness, chemotherapy, and so much more. Relief Band is legitimately a band you wear on [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=355.2s)]
*  your wrist to give you the relief from nausea and you can change the intensity depending on how you're [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=361.36s)]
*  feeling to make it stronger or weaker. It's 100 percent drug-free, non-drowsy, works quickly [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=366.88s)]
*  before or after symptoms start, and has zero side effects. Now I was recently on a ferry in New [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=372.88s)]
*  York, first time in a while, and I used my Relief Band. It was a lifesaver. And Relief Band isn't [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=379.44s)]
*  magic, it's science. Relief Band's technology was originally developed for hospitals before being [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=386.4s)]
*  sold to consumers. Relief Band is FDA approved and clinically proven and recommended by doctors [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=391.68s)]
*  nationwide. Now at first I was skeptical, but Relief Band is the real deal. It actually relieves [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=397.44s)]
*  my nausea. Now I'm very conscious of what I put in my body, so I love that I don't need to take any [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=403.68s)]
*  pills for Relief Band to just work its magic. Relief Band has sold over one million devices [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=409.04s)]
*  and is backed by thousands of four-star and above reviews, making it a trusted choice for fast-acting [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=414.88s)]

*  play this clip. On the other side, campaigners for the centrist candidate and mayor of Bucharest, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=456.96s)]
*  Nekoucha Dan, are worried. The country is turning to the extreme right, away from the European Union [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=461.84s)]
*  and towards the influence of Russia. The independent candidate presents himself as [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=469.84s)]
*  anti-corruption. He says the campaign has been tough. People don't have a lot of confidence in [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=475.68s)]
*  traditional media and are looking elsewhere. There's lots of information out there about me [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=484.24s)]
*  and there's no verification. The latest polls show the candidates in a near-dead heat, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=489.36s)]
*  with a slight advantage for the far right. Let's take a look at how the local Bucharest [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=497.2s)]
*  coverage has been describing this surge in young voter turnout today. Here play this clip. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=503.6s)]
*  Turnout has come to be a lot higher than people anticipated, especially among young people the ages [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=509.92s)]
*  between 18 to 34. And those are really the numbers that everybody is here observing, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=516.72s)]
*  two types of votes. The votes of the young people who tend not to vote in as many numbers as they [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=522.64s)]
*  have chosen to come out this time, according to the electoral registry here in Romania. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=529.68s)]
*  While on the other side, we did see George Simeone already cast shadow over these elections, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=537.04s)]
*  basically stating that some 1.8 million dead people were still registered and eligible to vote, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=544.2399999999999s)]
*  saying that he hopes that those people did not rise from the dead to cast their vote. While on [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=551.68s)]
*  the other side, Nicosaur Dan has already said that as far as he is concerned, the votes [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=557.12s)]
*  that are coming in are being counted as they are coming in. And he sees no transparency issues [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=565.44s)]
*  in these elections as of this morning. The polls will close at some 9 p.m. But if these polls are [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=573.28s)]
*  challenged and additional doubts are casted on the election electoral results, it may take days [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=580.32s)]
*  and possibly even weeks to get the results of this election. I also thought one of the defining [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=588.48s)]
*  moments of this election was this clip that went viral right here of a Romanian woman singing the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=594.8000000000001s)]
*  national anthem after casting her vote, a powerful moment unfolding at this polling station in [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=601.7600000000001s)]
*  Romania as a woman broke into song after voting, proudly singing the national anthem, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=608.88s)]
*  recognizing that if the vote went for George Simeone, Romania would likely have been fully [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=615.84s)]
*  lost to Vladimir Putin. It would have become another satellite country of Putin. And fortunately, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  Romania said not today. Here, watch this clip. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=629.84s)]
*  The [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=633.6s)]
*  Now here's the iconic fountains in Bucharest, lighting up the colors of Europe and the European [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=653.76s)]
*  Union to celebrate their hard fought victory over fascism. Long live Romania, long live Europe, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=660.88s)]
*  Slava Ukraini. Play this clip. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=668.48s)]
*  Now [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=670.88s)]
*  it's also worth showing you as well this clip from earlier in the day of Bridget Brink, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=690.88s)]
*  who recently quit her post as US ambassador to Ukraine. And here she talks about how [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=698.4000000000001s)]
*  what Trump was doing was basically sucking up to Putin and selling out Ukraine and treating the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=706.48s)]
*  victim, Ukraine suffered the unlawful invasion by Putin as the aggressor. Here's why the ambassador [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=712.4000000000001s)]
*  to Ukraine quit her post. And I think this all ties into what we just saw in Bucharest [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=719.6s)]
*  with the Romania election. Play this clip. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=725.12s)]
*  And committed war crimes and atrocities at a level we haven't seen since World War II. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=755.28s)]
*  I resigned from Ukraine and also from the Foreign Service because the policy since the beginning of [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=761.52s)]
*  the administration was to put pressure on the victim Ukraine rather than on the aggressor, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=766.96s)]
*  Russia. I fully agree that the war needs to end, but I believe that peace at any price is not peace [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=772.48s)]
*  at all. It's appeasement. And as we know from history, appeasement only leads to more war. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=779.76s)]
*  And to be clear, you are a career diplomat. So that means you serve regardless of who is the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=785.36s)]
*  president of the United States and what party they come from. And in fact, when you tried to [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=790.4s)]
*  leave post in January, Secretary Rubio asked you to stay on in Kiev, as I understand it. You were [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=794.24s)]
*  there for a number of months until April. What specifically with this policy is a problem for [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=799.36s)]
*  you because you did you worked at post under the Trump administration. Was there a trigger that [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=808.72s)]
*  made you say we're getting it so wrong? Well, I would say it wasn't a hard, a hasty rash decision. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=815.12s)]
*  It was one that I took over the first three months of the administration. But the first sign was the [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=822.8000000000001s)]
*  Oval Office meeting in February, in February, President Trump and President Zelensky, where I [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=827.36s)]
*  saw that our approach is to put pressure on Ukraine and not pressure on Russia. So folks, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=832.08s)]
*  a major upset, but an important one for the sake of democracy, for the sake of rejecting Putin and [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=838.08s)]
*  MAGA. Romanian voters showed up despite the far right wing candidate, George Simeon of the AUR, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=847.2s)]
*  winning the first round of elections early in May, which scared a lot of people into thinking [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxous7ZAaI&t=855.76s)]
