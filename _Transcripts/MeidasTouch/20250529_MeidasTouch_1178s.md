# Fox News PANICS on AIR as Trump Suffers MAJOR DEFEAT
**MeidasTouch:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA)
*  Fox News was in full collapse mode last night when a federal court struck down Donald Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=0.0s)]
*  tariffs against the world. A three-judge panel on the international trade court in the United States [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=6.48s)]
*  said Trump did not have the ability to issue those tariffs by invoking emergency powers. So, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=14.4s)]
*  what were the Fox hosts doing? Well, you had Laura Ingraham getting the news live on TV. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=20.56s)]
*  She was questioning MAGA Republican Senator Kennedy. He was not exactly prepared for this [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=26.48s)]
*  question. Watch what went down. Senator, we just got breaking news. Senator, I'm so sorry to interrupt. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=32.96s)]
*  We just got other breaking news. The big news tonight. A federal court just blocked the majority [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=39.04s)]
*  of Trump's tariffs. The court of international trade saying he overstepped his authority on an [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  international emergency economic powers act. This was, I believe, the three-judge panel. There was a [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=49.68s)]
*  Reagan appointee, a Trump appointee, and a Biden appointee on this particular panel. This was kind [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=56.16s)]
*  of widely predicted among those who study trade closely. So, those European tariffs blocked. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=63.279999999999994s)]
*  Senator, your reaction? You mean that a federal judge has intervened with the other two branches' [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  ability to make policy? I'm shocked. That hasn't happened since yesterday. It'll be taken up. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=83.28s)]
*  It'll be appealed. I think it's pretty clear that the president has tariff authority. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=93.04s)]
*  Congress gave it to him. Now, you can debate whether that was a prudent move or not, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=97.76s)]
*  but I think it's pretty clear that he has tariff authority. So, then Fox realized they had to kind [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=103.92s)]
*  of switch gears. Let's go into some other questioning. You had MAGA Republican Congress [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=109.2s)]
*  member Dan Mauser from Pennsylvania on, and you could even see Laura Ingraham just losing her [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=116.0s)]
*  patience with all of her guests at this point. She knows what she's doing. She knows the con [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=122.0s)]
*  that she is perpetuating as state regime media. So, here you... But this one was even too [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=129.52s)]
*  ridiculous for her. You have this MAGA Republican Congress member Dan Mauser basically saying that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=135.44s)]
*  the Nippon steel deal, acquiring U.S. steel, is not an acquisition, he claims. He goes, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=141.2s)]
*  it's like an investment, just part of Donald Trump's agenda. It's not actually an acquisition. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=148.0s)]
*  It is an acquisition. That's why Donald Trump promised that he was going to block it to protect [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=152.56s)]
*  U.S. steel, and then went back on that. Here, play this clip. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=158.96s)]
*  Mel and University. Yeah. Congressman, I don't blame you. I think you're... [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=162.24s)]
*  It would be a big risk for them to take. Yeah. You're doing what you should do for your district. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't have any doubt about that. But President Trump campaigned against a deal that would end up [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  with ultimately 51% control of a critical industry like steel in the hands of a foreign entity. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=178.24s)]
*  Now, you're saying... We don't see the terms of the deal. I'm the lawyer, so I want to see the deal. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  I don't know why they're hiding the terms of the deal. I haven't seen the deal. Have you [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=190.4s)]
*  actually seen the terms of the deal? No. I have seen where CFIUS is on it and how those [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=193.12s)]
*  national security concerns can be mitigated. I also know that the president has reviewed it, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=200.16s)]
*  as has, I believe, Scott Besant, Howard Lutnick, and others. But it's still being structured, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=205.44s)]
*  Laura. It needs to be highly satisfactory. Congressman, yeah. I'm not trying to be [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=212.4s)]
*  difficult. But it's still being structured. But we have heard repeatedly that this is a partnership. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=218.4s)]
*  On the US Steel website, it says, it's a good thing, basically I'm paraphrasing, that we are [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=225.68s)]
*  being acquired by Nippon. Are you saying tonight that they're not being acquired by Nippon? Because [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=230.32s)]
*  that's what it says on the US Steel website. I'm saying it's strictly an investment, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=238.24s)]
*  just like the other investments that the president's economy that he's creating are being [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=244.32s)]
*  made. It will be American owned. It will be American run. The White House has investigative [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=249.6s)]
*  and oversight authority. And that is what we have, the deal that we have. So then for the rest of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  the evening, Fox had to be like, all right, let's just not talk about the fact that Donald Trump [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  just got destroyed on his tariffs against the world until we really formulate what are our [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=268.24s)]
*  talking points going to be. So then you have like Jesse Waters lying and saying that the real reason [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=274.64s)]
*  why we are cutting SNAP benefits and why we're cutting food stamps and all this assistance is [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=281.44s)]
*  because all of the recipients are using it to buy designer bags. No, they're not, Jesse. And stop [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  with this offensive BS propaganda, man. Just stop it. Play this clip. Beautiful Charlie Hurt. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=294.72s)]
*  Before we get to legislation, I know I needed you to answer this question. Can you buy a designer [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=302.8s)]
*  bag with an EBT card? You know, it's remarkable. It's amazing the stuff that you can buy in America. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  It's a free country with an EBT card. You can buy whatever you want. And you know, it's so funny, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=317.68s)]
*  because if you actually cared about people who were relying on EBT cards and their children, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=324.56s)]
*  you might limit what they could buy. I'm just thinking, you know, just spitball. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=330.4s)]
*  I'm sure the kids don't love the purse. I'm sure the kids might want something else besides the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=334.16s)]
*  purse, probably anything but the purse. How about the cow? And then Jesse Waters has to go kind of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=339.76s)]
*  extra deranged and weird. And then he starts talking about, you know, if you're rocking a [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=346.4s)]
*  spread collar, Trump is going to take you to Brooks Brothers. Yeah, because that's what the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=351.84s)]
*  most American people don't even know what the hell you're even talking about, Jesse Waters. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=357.67999999999995s)]
*  Play this clip. Once the shoe check's done, up to the neck. Trump's got a thing for collars. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=361.11999999999995s)]
*  If you're rocking a spread collar, Trump's taking you to Brooks Brothers. I know from experience. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  I was playing around last year and Trump hand delivered me a shirt with a traditional collar. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=372.32s)]
*  And since then, my collars have been less British. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=377.84s)]
*  Folks, what I want you to understand is that these are the elitists, the Jesse Waters, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=382.55999999999995s)]
*  the Laura Ingrahams, the Sean Hannity, running a total con on the American people. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=388.32s)]
*  And one of the things we saw when Fox settled the defamation lawsuit against Dominion for [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  close to $800 million, when we read the text messages of these Fox hosts, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  they hated their audience. They talked about how stupid their audience was and that they knew they [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=405.76s)]
*  just had to spread the lies in order to make money. We've seen the messages, yet their audience like, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=411.36s)]
*  okay, Laura Ingraham, I guess it's okay. Do you struggle with bloating and discomfort [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=416.96s)]
*  after your morning coffee? Well, after drinking everyday dose consistently, my bloating has [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  reduced and my face, it feels less puffy. Everyday dose is coffee plus benefits. It combines 100% [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=426.32s)]
*  arabica coffee with powerful ingredients like limes made in shaga, collagen protein, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=434.24s)]
*  and utropics to fuel your brain, boost focus, and give you clean, sustained energy all day long. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=439.52s)]
*  There's no crash and no jitters, just clean, sustained energy. The two products of theirs [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=446.32s)]
*  that you need to check out like right this second are their coffee plus and their coffee plus bold. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=452.24s)]
*  Coffee plus is a mild roast. It's light and smooth. It's low acidity, which is easy on [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=458.64s)]
*  sensitive stomachs and it gives you this mellow sort of energy. It's awesome. Coffee plus bold, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=464.4s)]
*  that's their rich blend of medium roast, 100% arabica coffee, robust and full bodied, yet smooth. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=470.08s)]
*  It gives you that extra boost of energy you're looking for. Both are 100% arabica coffee and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=477.84s)]
*  they have functional benefits that are also mold free. Now, everyday dose, they do third party [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=483.92s)]
*  testing. I love that. Get 45% off your first subscription order of 30 servings of coffee plus [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=489.6s)]

*  rechargeable frother and gunmetal serving spoon by going to everydaydose.com slash Midas or entering [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=502.48s)]
*  Midas at checkout. You'll get free gifts throughout the year. That's everydaydose.com [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=511.44s)]
*  slash Midas for 45% off your first order. One of the things they were talking about on Fox [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=518.08s)]
*  throughout the day as well was Melania Trump's spokesperson shuts down, quote, completely false [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=523.68s)]
*  theory that Donald Trump is attacking Harvard because Trump couldn't get into Harvard and that [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=531.04s)]
*  Barron applied to Harvard but couldn't get in. She shut it down as our editor in chief, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=538.08s)]
*  Ron Filipkowski, says sarcastically. Melania denies the story that Trump is going after Harvard [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=543.12s)]
*  because he and Barron were rejected. They ran this, this is why I call them state regime media, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=549.44s)]
*  because they literally just launder the regime stuff. Like what are you even talking about? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=555.44s)]
*  Barron did not apply to Harvard. First Lady Melania Trump quashes the conspiracy theory [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=561.2s)]
*  about her son. I like that they say that that's the conspiracy theory and not all of the conspiracy [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=568.32s)]
*  theories that they launder in every day. It actually impacts the American people like now [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=573.84s)]
*  because of their deranged and unhinged conspiracy theories. You have the FDA preventing healthy [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=579.2s)]
*  people under the age of 65 from getting the COVID vaccine. You have all of their deranged [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=585.28s)]
*  election conspiracies, but I'm sure Fox is quashing the conspiracy that Barron applied to [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=591.04s)]
*  Harvard. So ridiculous. Then they bring on transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=597.52s)]
*  who got famous from being on the Real World Reality Show and the Real World Road Rules [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=603.8399999999999s)]
*  Challenge. Then you have Sean Duffy whining and complaining about the things that are [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=608.72s)]
*  quite literally his job. You're the transportation secretary. If you don't like the way public [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=614.56s)]
*  transportation looks, fix it. The world class cities in the world have good public transportation [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=621.28s)]
*  systems. As Brandon Friedman says, that's why they're world class cities, but these [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=629.8399999999999s)]
*  MAGAs are just a bunch of whiners. Oh, the liberals talk about public transportation and the climate [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=635.4399999999999s)]
*  and all of the time here playing this clip. And by the way, listen, if you're a liberal, Larry, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  they want you to take public transportation. I'm okay with public transportation. We have a whole [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=647.6s)]
*  department here for it. The problem is that it's dirty. You have criminals, it's homeless shelters, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=651.4399999999999s)]
*  it's insane asylums, and it's a work ground for the criminal element of the city to prey upon the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=657.36s)]
*  good people. So if you want people to ride a subway, make it clean, make it safe. It's very, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=664.88s)]
*  very simple. But these liberals, I don't know, Larry, maybe you figured them out. I don't get [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=670.56s)]
*  it. They don't think through this stuff and they come up with stupid policy. Well, they don't invite [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=675.04s)]
*  me to their dinner parties anymore in New York. I mean, so I just have to deal with that. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=679.3599999999999s)]
*  You never invited me, Larry. Mr. Secretary, another point. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=683.5999999999999s)]
*  And then like just straight up authoritarianism, straight up central planning, you have Linda [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=687.5999999999999s)]
*  McMahon. Linda McMahon. She reminds me, she's got that posture of treasury secretary, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=693.92s)]
*  Scott Bessent, you know, these billionaires are close to billionaires. She's a billionaire. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=702.16s)]
*  Bessent's worth almost a billion dollars. They go, well, here's what we're going to do in the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=706.3199999999999s)]
*  Trump administration. We're going to, so Scott Bessent, we're going to, and here, Linda McMahon, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=710.56s)]
*  we're going to, the regime wants to make sure that the universe, I'm not sure what that accent is, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=715.8399999999999s)]
*  that the universities are complying with what the regime wants. I mean, this is just straight up [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=721.84s)]
*  authoritarianism 101. It's not like close to it. You're talking about using the government to attack [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=727.6800000000001s)]
*  private universities, even if we're attacking public universities. Here, play this clip. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=734.48s)]
*  True, and I couldn't agree with Tammy Bruce Moore in that we do have a right to know who these [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  students are. I mean, clearly this is in the hands of the State Department and the Secretary [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=742.8000000000001s)]
*  of Homeland Security. This is not falling under DOE or the Department of Education, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=747.28s)]
*  relative to these actions, but the president was really clear, who are these students that [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=752.88s)]
*  are coming into the country? Who are these teachers? It's part of what we were asking with [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=757.04s)]
*  Harvard. What is their screening process? How do we know who are coming? What ideology the teachers [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=760.16s)]
*  may be teaching? Do the students have any background of being involved in any kind of activity that [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=765.28s)]
*  could cause riots on campus? And I think we clearly have a right to know that. That's [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=772.4s)]
*  within the realm of expectation of students who are coming into our country. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=778.0799999999999s)]
*  Then bring in Kelly Loeffler, Kelly Loeffler, Kelly Loeffler, who runs the Small Business [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=782.56s)]
*  Administration. She's a billionaire. Bring in the billionaire who runs the Small Business [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=789.36s)]
*  Administration. That makes sense to you. And she talks about the WNBA continues to attack [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=794.48s)]
*  Caitlin Clark. And even Caitlin Clark's like, can you stop using the fact that I'm white [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=802.0s)]
*  and I'm a white WNBA player to push your agendas? Even Caitlin Clark's like, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=808.88s)]
*  I just want to play basketball, guys. Leave me alone. But for Fox, they got to push this, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=814.16s)]
*  play this clip. Well, well, I was a team owner for a decade. And it's the WNBA continues to step on [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=820.8s)]
*  a rake when it comes to Caitlin Clark, who is their billion dollar player. I mean, she's increased [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=828.0799999999999s)]
*  ratings beyond all expectations. It's incredible to see what she's done. But you know, now to the [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=833.8399999999999s)]
*  point of they're not only going after Caitlin Clark, they're going after the fans of the team [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=840.16s)]
*  that she plays for and that investigation. And, you know, look, fans want sports to be about sports. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=844.56s)]
*  They want sportsmanship. They want to see the thrill of victory, the agony of defeat. And this [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=851.1999999999999s)]
*  league continues to kneecap itself when it comes to really promoting what could be a great sport [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=856.0799999999999s)]
*  and reverting back to social justice issues that were proven to be an abject failure for the league [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=862.2399999999999s)]
*  in 2020 and continue to be. And then I got to give a hat tip to Jessica Tarlov, the pro-democracy [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=868.24s)]
*  voice on Fox, who just ripped these MAGA hosts to shreds. Watch what she had to say here. Play this clip. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=875.36s)]
*  There is an important distinction to be drawn between being accessible and being good or [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=883.92s)]
*  delivering truth or actually saying what's going on in the world. And now I'm all fuddled up in my head. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=892.56s)]
*  But you've been told Bibi Netanyahu to cut it out. We don't call him Bibi. I always get that name wrong. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=899.52s)]
*  Well, don't. It's important. There is, Donald Trump does this thing. Not only, like today, he says, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=904.3199999999999s)]
*  that, you know, we got 5.1 trillion in the Middle East. It was 1.5 trillion like a week ago. But most [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=910.3199999999999s)]
*  importantly, he sits down for these interviews and I think Biden should have been more accessible. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=915.5999999999999s)]
*  Maybe we would have had a competitive primary if he had been more accessible. But he does these [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=918.72s)]
*  interviews and then he says, I don't know or I'm not sure. Like, Kristen Welker asked him, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=922.8s)]
*  do you need to uphold the Constitution? I don't know. Ask a lawyer. Are you sending migrants to Libya? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=927.76s)]
*  I don't know. Ask Homeland Security. You just announced a new nominee for Surgeon General who [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=932.56s)]
*  didn't graduate from med school. Why? Bobby likes her. I don't know her. You have the power to bring [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=937.04s)]
*  back Abrego Garcia. I don't make that decision. Lawyers do. You are arguing on behalf of him right now. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=942.16s)]
*  No, I'm not. I'm saying that that is what the criticism is of him. He may be in front of you, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=947.44s)]
*  but that doesn't mean that he's not spewing utter BS. But you know what? And he or she talks about [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=952.4000000000001s)]
*  why the budget bill is awful. Play this clip. The funny thing is the reason why there's so much [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=957.6s)]
*  opposition to the bill is because it didn't go far enough. This is not about spending. I mean, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=962.48s)]
*  you're saying this bill is awful because they're going to be cutting. We have to cut. We are heading [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=968.24s)]
*  toward a doom. We're in a doom spiral. But it balloons the deficit. I'm saying that, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=976.32s)]
*  but that's not why you're mad about it. You're mad that they might cut something or they might [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=981.6800000000001s)]
*  cut taxes and they might cut Medicaid. I'm saying is you should be mad that they're not cutting more. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=986.32s)]
*  In terms of cutting Medicaid, let's be honest about the Medicaid stuff. This is about able-bodied young [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=991.84s)]
*  men and illegal immigrants. So push that aside. Here she comes with the data about the polling [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=997.12s)]
*  about Trump. And I'm also committed to the truth, Jesse. And the truth is that the Democrats are [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1003.2s)]
*  very unpopular, but so is a lot of what Donald Trump is doing. So in a polling, Marquette, Fox News, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1009.76s)]
*  all the goodies, he's down 16 on the economy, down 14 on foreign policy, 26 on handling tariffs, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1019.6800000000001s)]
*  and 32 on cost of living. And this reconciliation bill that they're trying to pass through the [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1027.04s)]
*  Senate right now has opposition from more senators than they can handle. So you've got the Josh [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1032.0s)]
*  Hollies of the world, who's miraculously concerned about throwing people off Medicaid, Rick Scott, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1037.2s)]
*  and Maria Bartiromo was raking them over the coals this morning about his views, Rand Paul, who [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1041.76s)]
*  has been talking about everything from how unconstitutional it is for Trump to be putting [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1049.12s)]
*  in these tariffs to how we're ballooning the deficit, Ron Johnson, Susan Collins, Jerry Moran. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1052.48s)]
*  Those are a lot of senators that you've got to get on board. So if this is the big ticket item, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1057.52s)]
*  right? This is the big marquee agenda piece that we're going to give tax cuts to the wealthy. And [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1061.92s)]
*  we're going to take away food assistance and Medicaid. So we're hurting the poor to help the [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1066.0s)]
*  rich. That does not bode well for 2026 for the Republicans or for 2028, when we're going to have [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1070.4s)]
*  a big, beautiful primary and we will get a great candidate and everyone will forget about the hoity [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1076.72s)]
*  and we shall be victorious. Incredible, incredible stuff right there by [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1082.4s)]
*  Jessica Tarlov. Oh, and then of course you have on Fox Business, the MAGA Republican Congressman [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1087.3600000000001s)]
*  saying, we just have to listen to what Putin says. The real voice here has got to be Putin. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1092.96s)]
*  Here, listen. Russians don't seem to be taking President Trump very seriously. It's a sort of [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1098.0s)]
*  schizophrenic message coming out of them. I wouldn't take what Medvedev says very seriously though. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1104.48s)]
*  If you read his Twitter feed, it's absolutely, I don't want to say insane, but it's clearly absurd [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1110.0s)]
*  and not what you'd expect from a world leader. I think we really need to just listen to Trump, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1117.04s)]
*  Putin, the Kremlin and RNSE folks. That's the folks we need to be listening to. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1122.72s)]
*  But it also seems like President Trump is about to wash his hands of this. He's going nowhere. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1128.8s)]
*  He seems to be giving the problem to the Europeans. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1135.36s)]
*  Well, he clearly wants the Europeans to step up. He's wanted that since his first term [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1140.24s)]
*  and so he's very consistent on that regard, but the sanctions are a legitimate threat. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1SfHCK2xA&t=1145.1999999999998s)]
