# Trump has FULL MELTDOWN Sunday UNDER PRESSURE
**MeidasTouch:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU)
*  Yeah, Donald Trump is spiraling right now on Sunday. He's calling for military tribunals against former President Obama. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=0.0s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump's posting on his social media right now. A meme with a photo of him sitting next to former President Obama, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=8.0s)]
*  and it says, all roads lead to Obama. Retruth if you want public military tribunals. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=15.0s)]
*  This is coming from his official account, Donald Trump, that also posts this weird meme of him from an account called [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=22.0s)]
*  Spiritual Street Fighter, which is a QAnon death cult account. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=29.0s)]
*  And it's a weird meme of Donald Trump holding a sword, mind you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=34.0s)]
*  It's after he posted that he wants to see public military tribunals of Obama. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=38.0s)]
*  And it says, blind justice under the law will return to our republic. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=43.0s)]
*  When I say this is a QAnon account that Donald Trump is reposting, which is an actual death cult, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=49.0s)]
*  go and look at the account like I do. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=55.0s)]
*  Spiritual Street Fighter 17, it says, I believe in Q, the great awakening and holding the line. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=57.0s)]
*  And then it has the QAnon slogan, WWG1WGA! where we go one, we go all. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=65.0s)]
*  It's a literal QAnon death cult account that the president of the United States is posting. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=73.0s)]
*  So if you're wondering why is it that a credit agency like Moody's is downgrading the United States credit score, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=79.0s)]
*  it's because we literally have a psychopathic madman right now running the country and making posts of QAnon death cults [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=86.0s)]
*  and calling for military tribunals against a former president, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=93.0s)]
*  while the corporate media just wants to propagandize Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=97.0s)]
*  and pretend that this guy's actually doing deals when he's literally ripping apart the very fabric of the United States of America [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=102.0s)]
*  and trashing the United States Constitution. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=110.0s)]
*  Donald Trump then posted all of these posts right after each other, post after post after post this morning. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=113.0s)]
*  There's another post where he goes, we are taking back our great country. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=119.0s)]
*  Another post from this spiritual Street Fighter 17 account. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=123.0s)]
*  Then Donald Trump reposts this thing from Patriot Lady, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=127.0s)]
*  which says why haven't they raided James Comey's house in the middle of the night and arrested him? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=131.0s)]
*  So Donald Trump is reposting accounts calling for James Comey, Trump's former FBI director, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=138.0s)]
*  to be raided and arrested in the middle of the night. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=145.0s)]
*  Trump also, all these again, post post post. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=149.0s)]
*  There's about 10 other posts I'm not going to show you because you get the point, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=151.0s)]
*  but he's been posting all of these this morning. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=156.0s)]
*  Donald Trump then posts this person that says, with this like weird selfie of this guy, actual post from Donald Trump. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=159.0s)]
*  It says, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=166.0s)]
*  The term 86 means to like get rid of the trash. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=178.0s)]
*  It means like you kick somebody out. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=181.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean to actually kill somebody, but you're still on. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=184.0s)]
*  And by the way, all of these MAGA people in the past have posted 86 this person, 86 that person. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=189.0s)]
*  And now the former FBI director James Comey posted a photo of seashells that said 86 47 [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=195.0s)]
*  and y'all are making this like the main thing you talk about and whine about. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=201.0s)]
*  Because inherently not only is MAGA just a dangerous movement, it is a whiny. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=206.0s)]
*  It is a bunch of babies. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=212.0s)]
*  No offense to babies. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=214.0s)]
*  Oh, and then Donald Trump posts this photograph of New York Attorney General Letitia James this morning. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=216.0s)]
*  And he writes, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=221.0s)]
*  A sick and horrible woman who also happens to be grossly incompetent. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=222.0s)]
*  And then before he went to sleep last night, if he even did, he posted this video of himself. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=228.0s)]
*  But here's a photo of what he posted, like holding a guitar and playing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=235.0s)]
*  And this is an AI image of himself. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=240.0s)]
*  So after Donald Trump attacked Bruce Springsteen because Bruce Springsteen criticized Donald Trump selling out the working class [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=243.0s)]
*  and destroying factories and destroying American jobs and shilling for the billionaire class that Mar-a-Lago that Donald Trump is part of. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=250.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has this Bruce Springsteen complex. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=258.0s)]
*  So he's posting that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=261.0s)]
*  There's about 10 more posts like that. You get the point. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=263.0s)]
*  So when I say Donald Trump is spiraling, I want to just give you the objective exhibits. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=266.0s)]
*  None of this will be covered at all on corporate media. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=272.0s)]
*  If you, and I'm sure you don't even watch them anymore, any of the morning shows don't even reference that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=276.0s)]
*  They're talking about, did you think that Biden was this? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=282.0s)]
*  Did you think that Biden was? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=285.0s)]
*  That's what they're talking about. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=287.0s)]
*  So I would say that on any given day, if we're talking about cognitive stuff, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=289.0s)]
*  Donald Trump does 30 things that have me far more concerned than any scintilla of a thing I saw when Biden was in office. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=294.0s)]
*  And why are we talking about that? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=302.0s)]
*  Anyway, Donald Trump is engaged in a hostile takeover of our democracy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=304.0s)]
*  He's out there taking bribes from the Qataris. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=308.0s)]
*  He's out there crashing our economy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=311.0s)]
*  They're out there trying to do this tax bill that's going to give trillions in tax cuts for the billionaires and take away people's Medicaid. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=313.0s)]
*  You know what the commander in chief, by the way, should be talking about right now, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=320.0s)]
*  instead of all of these posts that he's making, these QAnon posts? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=324.0s)]
*  There have been, what, close to 20, right around 20 deaths in Kentucky, Indiana, Missouri, and Illinois right now from horrific tornadoes and storms. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=329.0s)]
*  You'll recall Donald Trump previously denied FEMA aid to Kentucky, to Arkansas, to Georgia, to North Carolina, to other states that needed it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=341.0s)]
*  And one of the things that we've now learned, and I'll do a whole other video on this, is that DOGE has ripped apart, as you know, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=351.0s)]
*  the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who helped predict the forecast. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=359.0s)]
*  So people in Kentucky were not even getting the forecast of these tornadoes and these storms until about 20 minutes to 30 minutes before the storms hit. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=369.0s)]
*  I truly blame Donald Trump for those deaths. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=379.0s)]
*  And maybe corporate media doesn't want to talk about Biden. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=382.0s)]
*  Donald Trump just, in my opinion, murdered at least 16 to 20 people, and he doesn't even talk about it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=384.0s)]
*  By the way, has he mentioned once, other than one time when he was prompted and didn't know what the hell he was even talking about, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=390.0s)]
*  the troops who died in Lithuania, the troops who died in New Mexico when Trump sent them to the border so he can make some propaganda statement to Mexico? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=396.0s)]
*  Has he mentioned that ever? No. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=406.0s)]
*  They actually have a gag order that the military is not allowed to talk about deaths and casualties in the Red Sea in connection with America's war against Yemen. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=408.0s)]
*  Did you know that, that they actually have a gag order? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=419.0s)]
*  You're not allowed to mention any type of casualties at all. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=422.0s)]
*  By the way, this morning you have Kash Patel, the FBI director, and Dan Bongino, the deputy FBI director. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=426.0s)]
*  These are the two people who now lead the FBI. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=434.0s)]
*  They were right-wing conspiracy theorists, nutbags, who ran like nut bag right-wing podcasts and spread conspiracies and lies. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=437.0s)]
*  These are the people running the FBI. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=448.0s)]
*  They were both interviewed together. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=450.0s)]
*  They had a dual interview for Maria Bartiroma, and they were asked, so did Jeffrey Epstein really kill himself or was someone else involved in it? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=452.0s)]
*  Let me show you what their answer is. Play this clip. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=462.0s)]
*  You said Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide. People don't believe it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=464.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, listen, they have a right to their opinion, but as someone who has worked as a public defender, as a prosecutor who's been in that prison system, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=469.0s)]
*  who's been in the Metropolitan Detention Center, who's been in segregated housing, you know a suicide when you see one, and that's what that was. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=478.0s)]
*  He killed himself. Again, you want me to get, I've seen the whole file. He killed himself. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=485.0s)]
*  I know it's hard work. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=492.0s)]
*  Okay. Okay. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=493.0s)]
*  By the way, it's right-wing people like you who were saying a very different thing before, and also where are the Epstein files? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=494.0s)]
*  Where are they? Release them. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=503.0s)]
*  Didn't you say you were going to release them, what, 100 days ago, 120 days ago? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=506.0s)]
*  Wasn't that one of the promises? Oh, wait, Donald Trump was best friends with Epstein. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=510.0s)]
*  So now you don't want to talk about that anymore. You don't want to mention that. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=515.0s)]
*  By the way, I think it's important that we, as when I do this analysis, I kind of reflect where people are getting their news from in general as well. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=519.0s)]
*  Like, take a look right here. One of the things I was telling you is that this Trump budget bill, remember I said it was going to fail in the budget committee before it ended up failing? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=530.0s)]
*  I said they don't have the votes in the budget committee. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=539.0s)]
*  MAGA Mike doesn't have the votes because the MAGA Republicans want to see more cuts to Medicaid than are even being made right now. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=541.0s)]
*  They basically want it totally gone, and right now it's only like 13 million people will lose their health care. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=548.0s)]
*  But other MAGA Republicans want to see everybody basically lose their health care. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=554.0s)]
*  They want more than $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=558.0s)]
*  So just take a look at this. There's a feature on something called Ground News, which is the research tool I use. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=561.0s)]
*  It's called Blind Spot, and it says Trump's big bill faces next hurdle in Congress as GOP conservatives warn they may not vote for it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=566.0s)]
*  So this was earlier in the week. Take a look at this. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=576.0s)]
*  This was being reported in terms of the amount of coverage. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=578.0s)]
*  Left-wing media reported on a 43% of the time. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=582.0s)]
*  Quote, unquote, center media reported on a 57% of the time. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=586.0s)]
*  Not a single right-wing outlet was reporting on this because they viewed that as, oh, if we report anything negative on Donald Trump, then he's going to get mad at us. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=590.0s)]
*  And then what ended up happening? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=600.0s)]
*  The bill failed, and it's one of the big disasters that Donald Trump is dealing with right now, that his, quote, unquote, big, beautiful bill is a massive disaster. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=602.0s)]
*  Remember, we're heading towards another issue where if they don't raise the debt ceiling, America's going to default on its debt, which has already been downgraded by Moody's. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=612.0s)]
*  We're approaching that deadline again. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=623.0s)]
*  We're approaching another government shutdown deadline again, and the MAGA Republicans are absolutely doing nothing. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=625.0s)]
*  That's why I think it's important that you use these research tools the way I do. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=631.0s)]
*  And the one I just use there is called Ground News. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=634.0s)]
*  It's my favorite research tool, and I think it's essential nowadays to kind of see through any double standards in the current media ecosphere. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=636.0s)]
*  Here's what you got to do. Go to ground.news.mtn or scan the QR code. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=644.0s)]

*  Again, I think Ground News is essential nowadays. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=660.0s)]
*  It's subscriber-funded, so they don't rely on ads. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=663.0s)]
*  That could also introduce bias. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=666.0s)]
*  Subscribing supports our channel and their independent team working to keep the media transparent. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=668.0s)]

*  Thank you, Ground News. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=680.0s)]
*  Speaking of trying to understand what's going on in right-wing and left-wing echo chambers, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=682.0s)]
*  you take a look here at what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this morning on Meet the Press when he was asked about accepting luxury planes from Qatar, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=687.0s)]
*  from Donald Trump accepting these luxury planes from Qatar. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=697.0s)]
*  He said, actually, what we should realize is that it's Biden's fault. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=701.0s)]
*  Biden wanted the jets. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=705.0s)]
*  So now they're blaming Biden for the Qatari jet to Donald Trump bribes. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=707.0s)]
*  Huh? Okay, play this clip. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=712.0s)]
*  It sends the wrong message. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=714.0s)]
*  It sends the wrong message and raises concerns ethically, raises concerns constitutionally and about security. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=715.0s)]
*  Why is it appropriate for the president to accept a $400 million jet from Qatar? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=722.0s)]
*  Well, it's not the president accepted. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=727.0s)]
*  It would be the United States government. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=728.0s)]
*  And Senator Mullins said this weekend that the talks had actually begun under the Biden administration. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=730.0s)]
*  So, but, Kristen, what I can tell you is I think this is an off-ramp for many in the media not to acknowledge what an incredible trip this was. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=737.0s)]
*  The President Trump has brought back trillions of investments in the United States. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=750.0s)]
*  Every stop we made, the enthusiasm in Saudi Arabia, in Qatar, in the United Arab Emirates to invest in the United States. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=755.0s)]
*  That they want to push more and more. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=766.0s)]
*  They have funds here. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=768.0s)]
*  And if we go back to your initial question on the Moody's downgrade, who cares? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=770.0s)]
*  Qatar doesn't. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=775.0s)]
*  Saudi doesn't. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=776.0s)]
*  UAE doesn't. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=777.0s)]
*  They're all pushing money in. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=778.0s)]
*  They want to, they've made 10-year, they've made 10-year investment plans. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=780.0s)]
*  So this administration, we're doing peace deals, trade deals and tax deals. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=785.0s)]
*  And just very- [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=791.0s)]
*  One of the things that Besant also tried to claim is that this is no different than the Statue of Liberty. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=792.0s)]
*  If you don't know the differences between America getting the Statue of Liberty, which Congress passed a resolution and America helped fund, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=798.0s)]
*  and Donald Trump getting a 747 jet to use for a hypothetical library so he can ride his billionaire friends around it. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=806.0s)]
*  If you don't know the difference between that. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=815.0s)]
*  And by the way, none of the media ever pushes back when Besant says that. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=818.0s)]
*  Because you know the Statue of Liberty, there was a congressional resolution on it, number one, and number two. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=822.0s)]
*  America also helped with a lot of the funding on it. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=827.0s)]
*  I mean, France did most of it, but America was involved in it. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=829.0s)]
*  And it's not like a jet that America, what are you even talking about? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=832.0s)]
*  You're saying him getting the jet is like the Statue of, isn't that just offensive at his most basic level? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=837.0s)]
*  Here he is as well when he's asked by Kristen Welker, what do you say to some Republicans who say the Qatari jet sends the bad signal? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=843.0s)]
*  He goes, it's just a gift to America. It's a gift to America. Here, play this clip. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=852.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=873.0s)]
*  And finally, Treasury Secretary Scott Besant is asked, well, what are you going to do? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=895.0s)]
*  You haven't done 90 deals in 90 days. You really haven't done any deals. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=900.0s)]
*  You did something with the United Kingdom. It's not a deal. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=904.0s)]
*  It literally says on the bottom, this is not a binding deal. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=907.0s)]
*  And all you did was give preferential treatment to Jaguar, Land Rover and Rolls Royce. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=910.0s)]
*  So that's not even a deal. China wasn't a deal. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=915.0s)]
*  You reached a consensus where America caved and gave up and bent the knee to Xi Jinping and just dropped the tariffs from 145 percent to 30 percent without getting any concessions. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=918.0s)]
*  So a deal that is not. So you haven't done any deals in 90 days. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=928.0s)]
*  So what are you going to do, Besant? That's how I would have asked the question. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=933.0s)]
*  Welker didn't ask it that way. But here's what Besant says anyway. Play this clip. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=936.0s)]
*  President Trump, while he was on the foreign trip, said that countries should expect letters from you, from Secretary Letnick saying this is what the tariff rate is going to be. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=939.0s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, does that effectively mean that these negotiations with other countries are over and how high should they expect tariffs to go above 10 percent? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=951.0s)]
*  This means that they're not negotiating in good faith. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=960.0s)]
*  They are going to get a letter saying here is the rate. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=963.0s)]
*  So I would expect that everyone would come and negotiate in good faith. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=969.0s)]
*  You expect that rate, though, that you would slap on any country that you think is not negotiating in good faith to be above 10 percent? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=974.0s)]
*  Well, I think that it would be the April 2nd level. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=979.0s)]
*  Some countries were at 10 percent, some were substantially higher. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=983.0s)]
*  And the negotiating leverage that President Trump is talking about here is if you don't want to negotiate, then it will spring back to the April 2nd level. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=987.0s)]
*  I have to ask you about the war in. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=996.0s)]
*  Oh, so what you're saying is you're going to do what you did on April 2nd. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=998.0s)]
*  You're just going to now send letters versus do it in a board and you're just going to impose what the tariffs are going to be on the countries. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1001.0s)]
*  Doesn't that sound exactly what you did on liquidation or Great Recession Day, which you called Liberation Day? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1007.0s)]
*  You haven't been able to do any deals yet with anybody. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1014.0s)]
*  No, nobody wants to do any real deal with you because you don't negotiate in good faith. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1017.0s)]
*  You've ripped apart existing deals and all these other countries are like, you know what? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1023.0s)]
*  We're just there are a bunch of clowns over there. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1027.0s)]
*  They're clown negotiators. No offense to clowns. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1029.0s)]
*  So we'll just we'll just wait this. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1032.0s)]
*  We'll just wait this thing out. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1035.0s)]
*  Take a look. Here's what Maga Mike Johnson has to say, though, when he's asked about. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1037.0s)]
*  And this just shows you how sociopathic they are. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1042.0s)]
*  This was this morning. So Maga Mike Johnson is asked, well, what do you think about Moody's downgrading America's credit score? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1045.0s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1053.0s)]
*  To which Maga Mike says, oh, I agree. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1055.0s)]
*  That's why we're doing this big tax bill. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1058.0s)]
*  Moody's literally downgraded it based on the tax bill, adding six trillion dollars to the deficit. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1061.0s)]
*  But do you see how he's like, oh, that's why we're doing this tax bill. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1069.0s)]
*  The tax bill is the reason why Moody's downgraded it. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1072.0s)]
*  Play this clip. All right. Quickly, I want to ask you about Moody's on Friday for the first time in a century. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1075.0s)]
*  They downgraded the U.S. government's triple A rating. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1079.0s)]
*  They say an increase in government debt and interest payment ratios, quote, that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1081.0s)]
*  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says it should be a wake up call to your party. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1089.0s)]
*  He says you're hell bent on a multi trillion dollar tax cut for the ultra wealthy. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1093.0s)]
*  What's your response? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1097.0s)]
*  It's just utter nonsense. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1100.0s)]
*  It's just like Chuck Schumer to create a crisis and then point fingers of blame. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1102.0s)]
*  This is the Biden spending spree that got us in this mess. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1105.0s)]
*  Moody's is not incorrect, but that's why that emphasizes the very need for the legislation we're talking about. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1108.0s)]
*  Historic spending cuts. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1114.0s)]
*  I mean, this will help to change the trajectory for the U.S. economy and send that message of stability to our allies and even our enemies around the world. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1116.0s)]
*  America is back. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1124.0s)]
*  President Trump's one big, beautiful bill will be passed and that will be the key to turning this thing around. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1126.0s)]
*  We have to get this done and it just shows more of the urgency of why we're doing exactly what we're doing with the legislation. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1131.0s)]
*  Well, a rare 10 p.m. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1137.0s)]
*  And by the way, Moody's downgraded our credit for the first time since 1917 when the when the company was formed, when Moody's was first was was first formed. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1139.0s)]
*  One more clip I want to share with you from this morning. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1151.0s)]
*  Marco Rubio is asked about the preferential treatment being given to white Afrikaners under Donald Trump's claim that they're experiencing a genocide. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1154.0s)]
*  There isn't a genocide taking place in South Africa against white people. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1164.0s)]
*  But the Trump says they're all getting massacred. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1168.0s)]
*  So Marco Rubio was asked, well, why are you giving preferential treatment to white Afrikaners to come to America versus other groups? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1171.0s)]
*  And also you're treating the Cubans for Trump and Latinos for Trump and Venezuelans for Trump. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1180.0s)]
*  You're sending them to concentration camps and back to Maduro or back to Castro. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1186.0s)]
*  How do you justify that? Here, play this clip. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1191.0s)]
*  The administration has prioritized bringing some white South Africans, Afrikaners to the United States, despite the increased restrictions on refugees. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1193.0s)]
*  President Trump claims there's a genocide underway in South Africa. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1203.0s)]
*  That's a legal determination. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1207.0s)]
*  The State Department would make it. Are you trying to determine that now? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1209.0s)]
*  I would determine that these people are having their properties taken from them. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1213.0s)]
*  You can call it whatever they want. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1217.0s)]
*  But these are people that on the basis of their race are having their properties taken away from them and their lives being threatened and in some cases killed. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1219.0s)]
*  These are people that applied and made these claims in their applications and seek to come to the United States in search of refuge. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1226.0s)]
*  We've often been lectured by people all over the place about how the United States needs to continue to be a beacon for those who are oppressed abroad. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1234.0s)]
*  Well, here's an example where we're doing that. So I don't understand why people are criticizing it. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1241.0s)]
*  I think people should be celebrating it. I think people should be supporting it. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSw26umP9mU&t=1245.0s)]
