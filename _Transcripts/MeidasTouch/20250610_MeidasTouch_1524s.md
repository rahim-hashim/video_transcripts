# GOP Witnesses CRUMBLE on Witness Stand AT LIVE HEARING
**MeidasTouch:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk)
*  Wow, these Trump cabinet members and top Trump officials had disastrous days on Capitol Hill [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=0.0s)]
*  during their testimony before the House of Representatives and in the Senate. I want to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=7.2s)]
*  share with you what went down. First, in the House of Representatives, Democratic Congressmember [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=12.88s)]
*  Aguilar was cross-examining Secretary of Defense former Fox host Pete Hegseth about the basis for [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=18.88s)]
*  Donald Trump federalizing the National Guard. Democratic Congressman Aguilar says, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=27.2s)]
*  there are three instances where it's permitted and it's required to be under the supervision and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=33.92s)]
*  control and with the permission of the governor. And there has to be an invasion of a foreign [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=40.24s)]
*  nation, a rebellion against the government, or the president is unable, with regular forces, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=44.64s)]
*  to execute the law. So Secretary of Defense Hegseth, you're saying that that was happening [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=52.0s)]
*  in Los Angeles? Watch what Hegseth admits to play this clip. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=57.6s)]
*  I don't know. You just read it yourself and people can listen to themselves, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=82.16s)]
*  but it sounds like all three to me. If you've got millions of illegals and you don't know where [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=92.32s)]
*  they're coming from, they're waving flags from foreign countries and assaulting police officers [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=96.32s)]
*  and law enforcement officers, that's a problem. The governor of California is unable to execute [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=101.6s)]
*  the laws of the United States. The governor of the California has failed to protect his people [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=107.76s)]
*  along with the mayor of Los Angeles. And so President Trump has said he will protect our [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  agents and our Guard and Marines are proud to do it. The law also says, Mr. Secretary, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  that the orders for these purposes shall be issued through governors of the states. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  You and I both know that President Trump has all the authorities necessary and thankfully, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=126.64s)]
*  he's willing to do it on behalf of the citizens of Los Angeles, on behalf of our ICE agents, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=130.4s)]
*  and on behalf of our country. We've also pulled a billion dollars. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=134.96s)]
*  A fairly stunning admission of how utterly unhinged this regime is that they're saying [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  all three are going down in Los Angeles. None of those three are going down. There's been no [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  permission or coordination with California Governor Gavin Newsom. This is patently unlawful. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=152.4s)]
*  And I like that the Democrats in this hearing, like Congresswoman DeLauro, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=159.12s)]
*  was not letting Hegseth filibuster. And she said, if you're showing up to a budget hearing, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=163.12s)]
*  you may want to bring the numbers, Hegseth. Watch this incredible moment. Play this clip. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=168.8s)]
*  In shipbuilding, the challenges our department under the previous administration [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=173.44s)]
*  squandered a lot of that. I know I want to, I want your plan. I've had, I've had difficulty [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=177.04s)]
*  with the prior administration and I don't mind calling them out. What is your plan for the future? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=183.44s)]
*  Can we get that in writing and on paper so that we know where you're going? Because we don't have [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=188.8s)]
*  anything today. We have zip, nada, and knowing where you're going. You could talk percentages. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=193.36s)]
*  You could talk about whatever you want. But unless this committee sees dollars and cents [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=198.72s)]
*  and where you're going and what your plan is, then we may reconsider what you need to do [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  to go forward. Give us the details. Congresswoman, we have the details and we will provide them. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  Let's have them before we, and my hope is that we could get to it before we go to a markup [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  within a few hours here today. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=217.92s)]
*  I yield back my time. General, lady yields back. Going back to Democratic Congress member Aguilar [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=223.04s)]
*  cross-examining Hegseth, he got one of Hegseth's chiefs, McDonald's, her name, to admit that the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  current estimated cost for Trump's, call it an invasion of LA, federalizing of the National Guard [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=236.88s)]
*  will be $134 million of what they're doing in Los Angeles. Just think about what they're costing [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=246.56s)]
*  the taxpayers based on what Trump's doing in Los Angeles. And I think that's going to exceed [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=253.68s)]
*  a billion dollars here. Play this clip. What is estimated cost of the deployment for the Guard [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=258.32s)]
*  and the Marines to LA? And where's this funding coming from? Will it be coming from quality of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=263.28s)]
*  life programs that affect our service members or our families? If you want to wait until I finish [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  Before I hand it to Brian, such as updates, housing and barracks. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=272.56s)]
*  Before I hand it to Brian, the insinuation that we're pulling money from housing and barracks in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  order to fund this is disingenuous and incorrect. Just ask. Brian can give you the numbers. Absolutely. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=280.48s)]
*  So the current estimated cost is $134 million, which is largely just TDY cost, travel, housing, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  food, et cetera. Pete Hegseth continues to filibuster as a Democratic Congresswoman McCollum [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=291.36s)]
*  has some good questions for him. And she's just like, look, if you're not going to bring the data, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=299.04s)]
*  then what's the point of this? If you don't know any numbers, what the hell are you even here at a [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=304.32s)]
*  budget committee for? Play this clip. That folks like Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass have implemented. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=310.0s)]
*  If the police chief said she was overwhelmed. So we asked the budgetary questions. I will yield [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=315.6s)]
*  back my time if the secretary refuses to answer the budgetary questions I put before them. They're [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=321.68s)]
*  important. What training missions aren't happening? Where are you pulling the money from? And how are [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=326.8s)]
*  you planning this in the moving forward? These are budget questions that affect this committee [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=331.68s)]
*  and the decisions we're going to be making in a couple of hours. If you're not going to answer them, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=337.04s)]
*  please let the chairman know. And I will take back my time and I will yield it back to the chairman. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, I want to just let us know what accounts you're pulling the money to fund. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=346.56s)]
*  Thankfully, unlike the previous administration, we've got a 13% increase in our defense budget, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=350.8s)]
*  and we will have the capability to cover down on contingencies, which is something the National [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=355.44s)]
*  Guard and the Marine plan for. So we have the funding to cover down on contingencies, especially [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=359.12s)]
*  ones as important as maintaining law and order in a major American city. As far as training, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=363.76s)]
*  all of the units on the ground have been fully trained in their capabilities of what they're [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=369.04s)]
*  executing on the ground. Chairman, I ask for budgetary, if he needs to get back to the committee [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=373.2s)]
*  with the numbers, I'd appreciate it both current and present. I'm happy to submit them for the record. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=376.48s)]
*  Now going to the Senate for a moment, you had Trump's head of NIH, Batyrya, he testified. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=381.04s)]
*  And I want you to watch Democratic Senator, let's start off with Democratic Senator Baldwin's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=390.56s)]
*  questioning of NIH Director Batyrya play this clip. We don't deny that it reduces the amount [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=396.32000000000005s)]
*  that will be spent on biomedical research next year by an even deeper amount than the 18 billion [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  dollars 40% cut already. So the way the forward funding works right now, we have multi-year [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=410.08s)]
*  projects that we fund. Yes. And forward funding says we will allocate the money for those multi-year [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=414.88s)]
*  projects this year rather than in the out years. And so if it's a four-year project, three of the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=421.52s)]
*  years will sit in an escrow account and not be spent next year. Again, further diminishing the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=428.08s)]
*  amount that will be spent on biomedical research. I think the thing is in the long run, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=434.0s)]
*  it allows you to spend more money and have more flexibility for new research projects. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=440.4s)]
*  Just the math. I'm an economist also. What it does is it says, look, let's allocate the money [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=448.96s)]
*  this year so that next year the money isn't tied up on previous year's projects. That's in the long [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=453.44s)]
*  run. I think, like I said, I'm happy to work with Congress and looking forward to working with [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  Congress on this. This is a budget proposal, not a final thing. I think if I had to start and [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=465.44s)]
*  redesign the system again from the start, allowing more flexibility as new scientific [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=471.6s)]
*  opportunities come up, the forward funding model allows that to happen actually more than [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=476.16s)]
*  the current model where large fractions of the NIH budget are tied up with old projects. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=480.48s)]
*  But as the transition ends, it really matters how we do it. And so I'm absolutely really glad [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=487.2s)]
*  to work with Congress on that to make sure that there's no disruptions. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=491.92s)]
*  Thank you. Then you have Democratic Senator Murray grilling Batyrya about cuts to medical research, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=496.4s)]
*  including ending HIV vaccine trials. Play this clip. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=503.68s)]
*  Your research effort to develop an HIV vaccine, just as scientists, including at the Fred Hunt [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=507.36s)]
*  Center in Seattle, are on the cusp of a functional cure for HIV. Terminating those HIV vaccine trials [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=514.0s)]
*  now cuts off access to treatment for 6000 patients in the network. You canceled a clinical [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=522.4s)]
*  trial evaluating new evidence based interventions for type two diabetes in rural communities [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=528.48s)]
*  in Appalachia. You terminated a clinical trial studying immunotherapy in combination with [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=534.8s)]
*  monoclonal antibodies to treat women with recurrent ovarian cancer. That is what has already happened. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=541.04s)]
*  So now you are coming to us today proposing to cut NIH funding by 40% next year. Tell us how many [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=548.24s)]
*  fewer clinical trials would you fund in the next fiscal year with a budget cut of $18 billion? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=555.76s)]
*  I just addressed HIV because I am absolutely committed to the in 2019. The President Trump [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=563.44s)]
*  issued a challenge for us to eliminate the threat of HIV in this country. And we've had a 22% [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=570.88s)]
*  reduction in HIV transmission since then. We now have the technological tools to do that. I've [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=577.44s)]
*  been working on developing a program to actually implement this vision so we can use new advances. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=582.6400000000001s)]
*  But you did terminate the HIV research at Fred Hutch that again was on the cusp of a treatment [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=587.12s)]
*  for 6000 patients nationwide. You did do that. I don't. I'd have to get back to you. You did do that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=595.36s)]
*  Okay. Senator, I mean, I think we actually have now the chance with the existing technologies, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=600.6400000000001s)]
*  Lenkappa and other technologies to actually address. I'm delighted to hear that. But I'm [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=604.64s)]
*  just telling you what clinical trials have been terminated. And I'm asking you this because we [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=608.8s)]
*  have to write an appropriations bill. How many fewer clinical trials will you fund in the next [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=613.92s)]
*  fiscal year with an $18 billion cut? Well, Senator, the budget request is a work of negotiation between [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=619.84s)]
*  Congress and the administration. President Trump has issued a letter to Secretary Kratzios [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=630.64s)]
*  committing the United States to be leading the leading. Yeah, okay. Well, you're not answering [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=636.08s)]
*  the question. We need to know how many fewer clinical trials. Can you get that number back [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=639.76s)]
*  to me, please? I mean, that you're asking for a budget. We're trying to figure out what that [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=643.36s)]
*  will fund. That's our job. The number depends on what the requests we get for proposals from [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=647.36s)]
*  all across the country. The budget itself will be dependent on what you all do as well as well. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=653.6s)]
*  I know, but we are trying to write a budget with the knowledge that you have with the requests [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=660.1600000000001s)]
*  that you have. I'm asking a question, how many fewer clinical trials? We need an answer back to [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=664.1600000000001s)]
*  that. Well, Senator, it's hard to give an answer to that because I don't know what the proposals [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  are going to be that will come in. I mean, you're asking a hypothetical question about what the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=672.96s)]
*  scientific- You came here today to ask for a budget that reduces NIH significantly. I would [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=679.2800000000001s)]
*  expect as director you would know what the impacts had. More from Democratic Senator Murray saying, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=684.4000000000001s)]
*  I want to know the numbers of employees who left the clinical center and the entire agency [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=689.52s)]
*  as a result of your personnel actions. Give me the numbers. Play this clip. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=695.6s)]
*  Answers from you for months. You told me 25 staff have been fired from the NIH clinical center out [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=698.8s)]
*  of the 1,445 who've been fired across the entire agency. But that does not include staff leaving [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=706.16s)]
*  after being offered buyouts or threatened with future layoffs. I want to know what is the total [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=714.8s)]
*  number of employees who left the clinical center and the entire agency as a result of [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=720.64s)]
*  the Trump administration's personnel actions in total. So for the numbers that I'm finding are [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=726.16s)]
*  for the reduction in force, that's the 25 I mentioned in our conversation. We'll get those [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=732.7199999999999s)]
*  numbers for the retirements deal. Well, I told you I was going to ask for this administration [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=738.9599999999999s)]
*  over the phone. I've requested this multiple times. How come you do not have that for us today? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=744.16s)]
*  I thought I thought my my misunderstanding. I thought you're asking for the reduction [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=749.52s)]
*  in force numbers, which we know I was being very clear. So I want to know by the end of the day, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=753.12s)]
*  can I have a detailed list of the reductions in staff by Institute by center by job function? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=758.16s)]
*  Not just the rifts, you know, not just the rifts, we'll get the total staff reductions. Can I have [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=764.8s)]
*  that by the end of the day? Okay, those are really basic questions. And I want to see that [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=769.04s)]
*  by the end of today. Then Democratic Senator Dick Durbin had his term to about your eye a play this [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=775.36s)]
*  clip. billion dollar increase in medical research at NIH. I couldn't have been prouder of all our [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=781.04s)]
*  bipartisan efforts to do that. This year, your budget wipes it out completely, wipes out $18 [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=787.5999999999999s)]
*  billion that we fought for over 10 years. And I can't understand that. I disagree with this [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=794.4s)]
*  administration on so many things. But this is the one that really gets to me personally, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=800.48s)]
*  to think that this nation would walk away from medical research. For God's sake, we lead the [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=805.92s)]
*  world in medical research, why would we give up on it? I look at the specifics here, cancer 2025, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=813.04s)]
*  2 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States, 600,000 people will die [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=820.24s)]
*  from that disease. Yet your budget requests a 38% cut 38% to the National Cancer Institute, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=825.92s)]
*  7 million people nationwide are living with Alzheimer's. This disease, of course, is [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=834.72s)]
*  devastating to families. It robs them of their loved ones. Yet your budget requests a 39% cut [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=839.44s)]
*  to the National Institute of aging. When you look at specific schools, of course, I'm [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=845.92s)]
*  concerned about Illinois, we have great research there. Northwestern University has not received a [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=851.1999999999999s)]
*  penny for NIH grants in 11 weeks. 1359 NIH awards to Northwestern have been frozen or terminated, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=857.4399999999999s)]
*  holding $81 million in research to date. I could go through some of the specifics of this research, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=868.16s)]
*  but it includes $9 million in clinical trials for brain cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=875.2s)]
*  childhood cancer. How are you able to reconcile these budget decisions with the reality of [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=882.8000000000001s)]
*  research and what it means to alleviate suffering and more importantly, to give people hope? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=892.08s)]
*  If research is underway, you at least have the hope that maybe there'll be a cure, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=898.88s)]
*  maybe in the lifetime of someone I love. How can you walk away from that? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=903.76s)]
*  Listen, my intention is not to walk away from that. I mean, I think that- [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=909.52s)]
*  But the budget speaks for itself. You cut 18 billion in research. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=912.48s)]
*  Listen, the budget is a collaboration between Congress and the administration. So, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=916.64s)]
*  you know, I look forward to talking about the advances that NIH research has made. I mean, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=922.16s)]
*  I think the transition has been a very bumpy time. And I don't mean to like downplay that, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=930.88s)]
*  but there have been opportunities for reform for how the biomedical research enterprise works. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=938.24s)]
*  I think the decisions about Northwestern happened before I got into office. But [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=944.8s)]
*  let me just say that- Buck stops in your office now. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=949.76s)]
*  I know it does. So let me just say that- Don't blame another person. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=951.92s)]
*  I'm not blaming- We're asking you and your insurance. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=954.8s)]
*  Senator, I agree with that. I want to tell you about our next sponsor, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=956.96s)]
*  StopBox. I am a responsible gun owner, and I use StopBox to make sure that my firearm is secure. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=960.8000000000001s)]
*  I have a five-month-old baby girl. It seems that she's getting older each day. I have a number of [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=970.32s)]
*  nieces and nephews in my house, and it is critical that I have the peace of mind that my firearm is [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=976.96s)]
*  safe, secure, out of their reach, and that that can never be accessed while making sure that I can [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=984.08s)]
*  protect my family. And one of the things that I like about StopBox Pro is it is 100% mechanical. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=990.64s)]
*  So you never have to worry about it not working when you need it the most. And I was surprised [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=999.6800000000001s)]
*  about how durable and well-made it is. And also, it not relying on a battery also gives me [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1006.48s)]
*  more peace of mind. All StopBox products are proudly made in the USA in their own facility. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1013.44s)]
*  Not only does this ensure the high-quality craftsmanship of every product sent out, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1020.8000000000001s)]
*  but it does also create meaningful jobs here. And you know, at the Midas Touch Network, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1026.56s)]
*  all of our products, all of our merch are made in America as well. So it's great to be supportive [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1032.16s)]
*  of an American business like StopBox. So for a limited time only, our listeners, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1038.4s)]
*  we're going to get a crazy deal here. Not only do you get 10% off your entire order when you use the [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1044.24s)]

*  One of the funny things I want to point out also, not funny things, probably disturbing things, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1082.0s)]
*  nobody knows what the hell Donald Trump and Pete Hegseth are talking about with the Golden Dome. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1086.88s)]
*  No one knows what the Golden Dome is. Even MAGA Republican Congress member Ken Calvert [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1093.28s)]
*  is saying to Pete Hegseth, what does the Golden Dome mean? We've seen you do an AI photo, but [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1099.12s)]
*  what is this thing that you're asking money for? You haven't described it. No one knows what it [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1106.96s)]
*  means because it exists in Donald Trump's maniac brain. Play this clip. Especially with a new [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1112.08s)]
*  technology like Golden Dome, which we still, as the ranking member pointed out, we still haven't [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1117.84s)]
*  seen a clear definition of what it is and what it's a strategic theater system, Lower 48, Hawaii, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1125.12s)]
*  Alaska, the rest of it. Hegseth also admits that he will be cutting funding to Ukraine. Let's play [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1133.9199999999998s)]
*  this clip. Reduction in this budget, as you know, this administration takes a very different view [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1139.52s)]
*  of that conflict. We believe it negotiated peaceful settlement is in the best interest of [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1144.72s)]
*  both parties and our nation's interest, especially with all the competing interests around the globe. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1149.84s)]
*  I don't think the word victory has been well defined or the path to it. And as a result, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1154.48s)]
*  a path to peace that stops the killing and the carnage is something that President Trump is [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1160.32s)]
*  very invested in. Democratic Senator Sheehan had some great questions for NIH director, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1164.32s)]
*  Batchariah. Let's watch this. How do you reassure researchers? How do you reassure [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1170.16s)]
*  academic institutions and patients, most importantly, that addiction research is not [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1175.44s)]
*  going to suffer when your budget proposes cutting funding and dismantling the very institute that [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1181.3600000000001s)]
*  has led to this critical work? Yes, the health needs for folks with overdoses are great. Almost [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1187.3600000000001s)]
*  100,000 deaths a year since 2020. I understand that. I've been working on it for over 10 years. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1194.56s)]
*  So don't tell me what the problem is. Tell me what the solution is and how you're going to [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1201.36s)]
*  address it when you're cutting your budget in areas that make a difference. The solution involves [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1206.24s)]
*  research, right? So as you said, Narcan, that's the result of NIH funded work. And I don't think [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1211.52s)]
*  it only involves research. The sharp increase in, I'm sorry, research in biomedicine, particularly, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1217.76s)]
*  but also in behavioral research to understand the sort of settings that lead to overdoses. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1224.24s)]
*  I think the NIH is going to play a really important role in that. The key thing is not the [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1231.52s)]
*  reorganization of the NIH. That's not as important to me as the activities that we're talking about. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1235.52s)]
*  The activities to do research that meet those needs, that's what I'm going to make sure happens [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1241.1200000000001s)]
*  with the NIH so that those, so that when, you know, if I come back four years from now, we can look [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1246.32s)]
*  back and say, you know, that we've reached the high watermark of deaths from overdoses, which [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1250.8s)]
*  spiked during the pandemic, and that we've addressed those needs with excellent research. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1255.36s)]
*  Well, it's hard for me to understand how we're going to address those needs [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1260.3999999999999s)]
*  with excellent research when you're cutting research grants, you're cutting personnel, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1264.24s)]
*  and we're seeing some of our best scientists talking about going to Europe and to other [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1268.24s)]
*  parts of the world because they don't feel like they can get a fair shake in the United States. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1274.0s)]
*  Thank you, Madam Chair. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1278.24s)]
*  And just seeing these MAGA Republicans on Capitol Hill and their press appearances, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1280.0s)]
*  like this just happened today. Like, just think about these three statements today. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1284.56s)]
*  You have MAGA Republican Congressmember Harriet Hagman saying that she absolutely loves that [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1288.96s)]
*  Donald Trump pardoned the January 6th insurrectionist. Play this clip. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1295.92s)]
*  ...out on January 6th. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1300.0s)]
*  On January 6th, what was your feeling about pardoning those who had been convicted of [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1301.6s)]
*  crimes related to January 6th? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1306.4s)]
*  I think it was absolutely appropriate because under the Equal Protection Clause [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1307.92s)]
*  of both the 5th and 14th Amendment, it's clear that they were being treated differently [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1311.76s)]
*  than other people. And again, I'm going to go back to the summer, the so-called summer of love of 2020, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1315.92s)]
*  the people who were burning buildings who were over $2 billion in damages. There's really no [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1321.1200000000001s)]
*  comparison as to what happened in 2020 and what happened on January 6th. Yet the people on January [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1326.4s)]
*  6th were treated very, very differently. One of the absolute linchpins of our Republic, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1333.36s)]
*  of our constitutional foundation is equal protection, which means that people who are [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1337.9199999999998s)]
*  similarly situated must be treated similarly. And that is not the circumstance of what happened [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1342.24s)]
*  with the people with January 6th. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1347.1999999999998s)]
*  That's one data point. Second data point, you have MAGA Republican Senator Kevin Kramer [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1348.7199999999998s)]
*  on raising the minimum wage. And he says, I don't think we should have a minimum wage. It could be, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1356.6399999999999s)]
*  why are we even setting a floor? Again, MAGA Republican Senator Kevin Kramer played this clip. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1363.0400000000002s)]
*  The federal minimum wage right now is $7.25. What do you think about raising the federal [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1368.0800000000002s)]
*  minimum wage? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1373.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't even know why we have a, quote, federal minimum wage, to be honest, because I [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1375.3600000000001s)]
*  don't know anybody. Where I come from in North Dakota, people are, you know, businesses are [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1379.44s)]
*  fortunate if they can get somebody for less than $15. And I think the market works really well, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1384.24s)]
*  Stuart. And I think that when you raise a minimum wage of $15, you reduce the number of people who [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1389.12s)]
*  can get a beginner's job, work at a fast food restaurant, work, whatever the case might be in [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1394.3999999999999s)]
*  the service sector or otherwise. So I don't, I just think manipulating markets with mandatory [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1400.32s)]
*  wages doesn't make any sense. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1406.6399999999999s)]
*  Mr. Senator, thank you very much for being with us this morning. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1408.8s)]
*  Then also today you have MAGA Republican Congress member and speaker of the House, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1411.36s)]
*  MAGA Mike Johnson, saying that he believes Gavin Newsom should be, quote, tar and feathered. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1415.68s)]
*  Tar and 1700s like medieval torture. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1422.88s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1427.04s)]

*  Gavin Newsom. You believe that Newsom should face consequences in a legal way? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1433.28s)]
*  That's not my lane. I'm not going to give you legal analysis on whether Gavin Newsom should [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1439.76s)]
*  be arrested, but he ought to be tart and feathered. I'll say that. I mean, look, he's [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1443.68s)]
*  standing in the way of the administration and the carrying out of federal law, right? He is [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1447.28s)]
*  applauding the bad guys and standing in the way of the good guys. He is trying to, he is, he's a [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1454.72s)]
*  participant and accomplice in our federal law enforcement agents being not just disrespected, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1460.88s)]
*  but assaulted. Is this a serious problem? And the governor is now filing a lawsuit against the [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1465.92s)]
*  president. What a joke. Do your job, man. That's what I tell Gavin Newsom. Do your job. Stop working [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1471.68s)]
*  on your rebranding and be a governor. Stand up for the rule of law. He's not doing that. So I [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1476.3200000000002s)]
*  don't know what the ultimate measure will be there, but I know that in the interim time, the [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1482.16s)]
*  president of the United States is showing real leadership and we're not going to allow LA to [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaUuhlg0sk&t=1485.76s)]
