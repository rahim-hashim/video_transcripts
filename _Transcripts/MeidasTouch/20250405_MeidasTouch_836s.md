# Trump voters TURN AGAINST him as MARKETS CRASH
**MeidasTouch:** [April 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc)
*  We are hearing a lot of stories like this and credit to more perfect union for capturing this one of these [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump voters who are either deeply regretting the vote that they made now that they're seeing [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=8.08s)]
*  their union rights absolutely gutted or just feeling very concerned and alarmed right now [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=14.56s)]
*  and really don't know what to do feeling betrayed and confused. I just want to share this with you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=21.04s)]
*  Go watch the full video and more perfect union release because I think they highlight this issue [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=26.72s)]
*  about the Trump regime tearing up the union contract covering 47,000 TSA workers. But that's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  a story that the Trump regime has repeated writ large across federal unions generally invoking [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=40.32s)]
*  national defense and other warlike powers to union bust gut unions here. Listen to the story. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=47.44s)]
*  Interesting one and then we're going to bring in a special guest. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=55.04s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. I like some of the Trump policies and that's the reason why I voted for [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=59.44s)]
*  them. But did I know it was going to threaten America? The America that I keep safe every day? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=63.28s)]
*  Bobby, a former Marine, has worked as a TSA baggage officer at Dallas Fort Worth Airport [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  for nearly 15 years. I've seen everything in a bag from dead gerbils in a bag to a kitchen sink. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=76.48s)]
*  Yeah, you name it. I've seen it. I've opened a bag where it was a garbage bag and it was me full [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=83.68s)]
*  of maggots. As a passenger, you want those maggots getting loose under the plane and getting in your [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=89.44000000000001s)]
*  bag? What I like about my job is I protect America. You know, I love protecting America. I love [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  the people that I interact with, you know, because I'm a people person. People think it's a benign [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  job, but it's an important job. If I have any suspicion at all, I check that bag [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=108.4s)]
*  because lives are at stake. It's not just a bag. That bag represents a life. What this current [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=113.68s)]
*  administration has done is they literally took away our bargaining rights. We signed a seven-year [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  contract in good faith. They think the union's a bad thing. We're not telling them how to do [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=126.56s)]
*  their job. We're just making our life more comfortable and they can concentrate on the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=131.76s)]
*  security of people. It's a tragic story and it's a story that's being repeated. Millions of Americans, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=137.44s)]
*  union members are feeling that. Workers across the country are feeling that. Watch the full video, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=145.76s)]
*  by the way, by More Perfect Union. They did a really great job there. Let's bring in Liz Schuller, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=150.96s)]
*  president of AFL-CIO. I'm sure you're hearing these stories a lot as well. The AFL-CIO has 15 million [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=156.32s)]
*  members, 63 different unions. You're standing up and defending all these federal workers and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=163.84s)]
*  litigation just generally. Liz, what are you hearing out there right now? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=170.72s)]
*  Well, that story was so familiar and I'm glad you captured it and started with that because that's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=175.36s)]
*  what this is about. These people aren't just numbers on a spreadsheet. They're human beings. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=180.72s)]
*  They're the ones who keep our food safe, our water clean, and care for our veterans when they come home [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  and keep our airplanes safe in the sky. I think it just defies common sense what's going on. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=193.28s)]
*  What I hear from workers is grave concern, the uncertainty they're feeling, the dehumanizing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=201.2s)]
*  nature of what's going on where you work hard and serve the people in the jobs that you do and then [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=208.56s)]
*  are just basically cast aside like your trash. It's horrible. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's part of it too. I mean, the unjustified terminations. But then one of the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=220.72s)]
*  things that I talk about a lot, it's like defamation too because the people are being told that it's for [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  performance reasons when it's not and they're being lied to and it takes the person's, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=234.32s)]
*  rips the people's soul, right? I mean, it's soul crushing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=241.28s)]
*  It's about dignity. I mean, all work has dignity and most of the work that's being done in the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=245.12s)]
*  federal government is about services that we rely on that often are unseen, that we take for granted [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=250.48s)]
*  until we don't have them, right? So I think that we're going to start seeing the impacts of these [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=257.44s)]
*  cuts because it's really not six degrees of separation, it's two, right? We all know someone [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=262.48s)]
*  or live next to someone in our neighborhood or depend on the services, like I said, our food [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=267.76s)]
*  safety. Who would have thought we'd have to worry about that, right? So I think that's what we're [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=276.24s)]
*  talking about is humanizing what is happening out there. Let's take a look at the approach by the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=280.88s)]
*  AFL-CIO. There has been a lot of lawsuits captioned AFL-CIO versus the various departments [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=287.12s)]
*  and administrations. You didn't hesitate to defend the union members, the various unions right away. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=297.12s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit through the litigations at a high level that are taking place and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=305.36s)]
*  the strategy to aggressively litigate? You weren't afraid, you didn't say, oh, well, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=310.64s)]
*  and they may retaliate. You're like, they're already going after, you know, and there was no [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=317.04s)]
*  hesitation with the AFL-CIO. That's what I appreciated right away from the jump. Talk to us [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=323.12s)]
*  about that. Yeah, thanks for that. And of course, we're a federation, as you said, an umbrella of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=328.4s)]
*  63 different unions, many of which are the federal unions representing workers like the American [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=333.44s)]
*  Federation of Government Employees, you know, the Professional and Technical Engineers Union, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=339.84s)]
*  the National Federation of Federal Employees. So the AFL-CIO is a lead plaintiff in some lawsuits [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=346.08s)]
*  and a party to many others. And then certainly our unions themselves are filing these lawsuits [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=352.64s)]
*  because of the direct impacts. But the one that really started for us was the probationary workers [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  that were fired. And we filed that day, I think, or the next morning to say this is an illegal [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=365.28s)]
*  action, right? We're not going to let you get away with it. And that lawsuit prevailed. So we were [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=372.79999999999995s)]
*  happy when they restored the jobs of these probationary workers who, as you know, many [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=377.84s)]
*  probationary workers are people who have worked in the federal government for some time, may have [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=383.11999999999995s)]
*  switched jobs and on our probationary period, and others who are new to the federal government. But [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=388.08s)]
*  as you said at the top, most of the firings that took place were unjust and without cause. And [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=396.4s)]
*  these were people who were performing and doing well in their jobs. The other lawsuit that I wanted [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=402.0s)]
*  to call attention to was the lawsuit when Doge, the, quote, Department of Government Efficiency, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=406.88s)]
*  decided they were going to go into the Department of Labor. And that day, we stood up at an emergency [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=413.35999999999996s)]
*  rally out in front and tried to essentially block him from entering. And of course, they converted [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=420.32s)]
*  it to a virtual meeting. But they were going to be accessing private data of workers who were [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=424.88s)]
*  whistleblowers, for example, who would be working in an unsafe environment and raised their hand to [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=431.84s)]
*  say, wait a second, this is wrong, became a whistleblower, which is a confidential [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=437.44s)]
*  process. That's the kind of data we're talking about, right? So we filed a lawsuit there as well [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=442.48s)]
*  to put up some guardrails to say, we need transparency. You don't get to just go in and [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=449.36s)]
*  access people's data with these, you know, 20 something Silicon Valley tech people. This is [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=454.72s)]
*  highly sensitive and security related data. And so we also were able to prevail in that lawsuit. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=462.0s)]
*  So we have here, we're happy for that. And also not to mention the NLRB lawsuit where the National [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=469.76s)]
*  Labor Relations Board, which is the traffic cop for, you know, people who are courageously standing [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=476.8s)]
*  up to form unions and are often fired. Well, the chair of the NLRB was fired illegally as well. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=482.24s)]
*  And so we filed a suit right away to get her reinstated. Yeah, I mean, those are all big cases [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=489.12s)]
*  with massive implications. And we could probably spend an hour if we wanted covering each. Although [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  the good news is, is we have a show, Legal AF, where we do cover all of those lawsuits that you [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=500.96000000000004s)]
*  brought. But I want to just even talk about this. Like these are the types of headlines we see [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=506.56s)]
*  on a daily basis, like on Friday, RFK Jr. says 20% of Doge's health agency job cuts were, quote, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=511.92s)]
*  mistakes around a fifth of the 10,000 jobs cut from the US Department of Health. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  The human services were done in error and need to be corrected. I mean, you're talking about [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=526.8000000000001s)]
*  10,000 people losing their jobs. And they're saying now these are human beings [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=533.6s)]
*  who have given their life to work jobs, who just want fair pay and to be treated with dignity. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=540.64s)]
*  And then it's like, like, oopsies, oopsies. Have you ever say you've been leading this union and [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=548.56s)]
*  you've been in the labor movement for a while? Have you ever seen anything like this? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=557.44s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. It is absolutely appalling and offensive to think about [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=562.72s)]
*  the carelessness with which they're approaching this. Because I think about what you were just [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=570.24s)]
*  saying about those workers at HHS. And these are the people we're relying on who are making sure [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=577.2s)]
*  that children are given the health care that they need. I mean, these are the services that [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  people rely on on a daily basis that are taken for granted. And our union workers who work inside [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  those agencies have been able to have a voice and speak out when they see something go wrong [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=599.2s)]
*  and not have to fear being fired in the past because they had a union contract. And that's why [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=607.2s)]
*  this action of last Thursday was so, so offensive, where President Trump basically, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=614.32s)]
*  with the stroke of a pen, took away the collective bargaining agreements of 700,000 union workers. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=619.76s)]
*  And the TSA worker at the beginning referenced this TSA was separate and a precursor to that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=627.36s)]
*  But then they just went whole hog across the entire government and just basically cancelled [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=633.2s)]
*  legally binding collective bargaining agreements that were negotiated in good faith. And to cancel [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=638.48s)]
*  someone's rights like that is a slippery slope. And for those out there listening who say, oh, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=644.24s)]
*  wow, you know, it sucks to be a federal worker. They're coming after you next. This is essentially [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=649.6s)]
*  a beta test for how far they can go. Next, we'll be, you know, rippling out over the public sector [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=655.44s)]
*  at the state and local level and then onto the private sector. So the strategy is litigation, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=661.44s)]
*  strategy is rallying people publicly. The strategy is building coalitions with other unions. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=668.32s)]
*  The strategy also that I'm seeing AFL-CIO promote protests, peaceful protests out and about. I saw [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=675.44s)]
*  the post. We're covering this here all weekend. The April 5th hands off protest. I saw a repost [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=684.0s)]
*  from AFL-CIO about that event right there. Can you talk to us about that mobilizing people [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=693.1999999999999s)]
*  to peacefully protest? And is that going to be part of a bigger strategy that you think may need [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=700.16s)]
*  to ramp up? Absolutely. And this is about escalation. We're starting with ladders of [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=706.48s)]
*  engagement. You know, we started in January with during congressional recesses, both February and [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=713.44s)]
*  March, it doubled every single month actions all across this country to give people an outlet. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=720.96s)]
*  You know, people are frustrated and they feel powerless, but we know in unions, that's what we [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDQnddP80Fc&t=726.88s)]
