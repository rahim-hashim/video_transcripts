# Trump CRASHES OUT at EVENING Presser to FINISH AWFUL DAY
**MeidasTouch:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0)
*  Well folks, I guess Donald Trump was not done embarrassing himself and his entire regime today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=0.0s)]
*  He decided to hold one more press conference later in the day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=5.36s)]
*  What a complete and utter mess this one was, and it followed utter disastrous press conferences earlier in the day. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Here, Donald Trump brags about going to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, and he goes, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=16.16s)]
*  This will be a great trip. Some of you will be joining me. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=22.319999999999997s)]
*  It should be noted that Donald Trump has personal deals to enrich himself with all of these nations. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=25.84s)]
*  Let's play the clip. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=33.28s)]
*  Now, although no media pointed it out, during the press conference we did, at the Midas Touch Network, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=52.24s)]
*  Ron Filipkowski wrote the following, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=80.56s)]
*  Next up, Donald Trump is asked about tariffs on pharmaceuticals. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=110.56s)]
*  And once again, Donald Trump says, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=115.92s)]
*  I will know more in two weeks. Just give me two weeks. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=117.84s)]
*  So yes, folks, two weeks strikes again. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=120.8s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, please. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  Do you have anything to say about this, what we just discussed? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=141.68s)]
*  We have had this crazy system in the United States where American farm-up manufacturers in the United States are put through the wringer with inspections. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=146.72s)]
*  And the foreign sites get off easy with scheduled visits while we have surprise visits to the United States. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=155.2s)]
*  Well, a scheduled visit is no inspection. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=162.32s)]
*  So we are at the FDA delivering on this promise in the president's executive order and switching from announced to surprise inspections overseas. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=165.04s)]
*  We're also not going to have our inspectors hanging out for three or four weeks. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=175.44s)]
*  They're going to get in and out and we're going to do more inspections with the same resources as a result. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=178.88s)]
*  Good. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=184.0s)]
*  Now, hasn't Donald Trump said everything's going to happen in two weeks? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=184.48s)]
*  This is going to happen in two weeks. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  That's going to happen in two weeks. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=188.64s)]
*  Healthcare plan in two weeks. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=189.6s)]
*  When are we all just going to realize that this is a rug pull presidency? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=191.2s)]
*  Donald Trump is a Ponzi schemer. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=195.6s)]
*  In his life, he's a fraud. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=198.64s)]
*  He's a felon. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=200.64s)]
*  He's a bankruptor. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=202.16s)]
*  He's a sexual abuser. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=203.92s)]
*  He's a destroyer, not a builder. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=205.92s)]
*  And you're seeing now why he bankrupted his casinos in Atlantic City, why he bankrupted so many countries and why, or companies and, and I suppose countries. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=208.48s)]
*  And now why Donald Trump is bankrupting our country before our eyes. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=220.96s)]
*  Next up, a reporter asked Donald Trump if he can speak to the concerns that people have regarding the administration cutting mental health programs. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=226.4s)]
*  And take a look at what Donald Trump says. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  Anybody have any questions on that? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=238.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=240.72s)]
*  On your proclamation designating this mental health awareness month, can you speak to concerns people are having regarding your administration cutting a billion dollars in mental health programs? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=241.44s)]
*  Well, we're looking very closely at waste, fraud, and abuse, of which there's a tremendous amount of people on that shouldn't be on, illegal immigrants on, people that came into the country illegally. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=251.11999999999998s)]
*  We have many of them and we're looking for that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  But for the population that's supposed to be there, it's perfect. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=267.28s)]
*  And they want us to do that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=272.64s)]
*  They don't want to have the waste, the fraud, and the fraud is big, by the way, or the abuse. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=273.84s)]
*  Question? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=281.44s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=282.24s)]
*  I actually have a question. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  As I would have said as a trial lawyer, objection, non-responsive. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=283.76s)]
*  What's he even talking about there? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  May I come with some receipts, folks? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  May I come with some receipts? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  As Carl Quintanilla posted, Cutter ain't no dummy. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=296.4s)]
*  Cutter and DAR Global developing Trump golf courses and villas and Cutter. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  Sources with knowledge are talking about the plans. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=304.96s)]
*  So Trump's going to use our taxpayer dollars to visit the development of his own Trump properties [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=307.76s)]
*  in Middle East countries that are buying him off. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=314.08s)]
*  From the New York Times, New Minis Project is latest Trump company deal tied to a foreign [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  government. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=324.08s)]
*  How about this one? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=325.2s)]
*  A fund backed by Abu Dhabi will be making a $2 billion business deal using a Trump firm's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=326.24s)]
*  digital coins. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=331.76s)]
*  That transaction would be a major contribution by a foreign government to President Trump's [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=333.36s)]
*  private ventures. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  Once upon a time we had a name for that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  It was called crime. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=342.88s)]
*  It was called unlawful. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=344.56s)]
*  We would make a big deal about it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=346.48s)]
*  We still do in the Midas Touch Network. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  Remember when the media made such a huge deal about some obscure real estate transaction [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=349.84s)]
*  that former President Bill Clinton was involved in? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=355.68s)]
*  The Whitewater scandal. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=358.32s)]

*  Donald Trump just doing all of these personal deals in front of our faces to enrich himself [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=362.71999999999997s)]

*  Instead of the president cosplaying as the next pope, he may want to try to cosplay as [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=547.28s)]
*  an actual president of these United States. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=553.68s)]
*  That means that he may have to do a little bit of research and decide that he wants to [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=556.0799999999999s)]
*  understand that he swore an oath and this oath was to protect and defend the constitution. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=561.28s)]
*  That is the oath that he was supposedly taking on January 20th, as well as we may want the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=567.92s)]
*  president to look into what the Declaration of Independence was about. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=575.52s)]
*  We may want him to understand that that was a foundational document as relates to self-determination [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=580.4000000000001s)]
*  of those who had recently gained their independence from Great Britain. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=587.2s)]
*  I would hope that he would maybe spend a few of these days in this first hundred days and it is [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=592.96s)]
*  sad to say that it's his second term that he doesn't understand that the Declaration of [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=598.1600000000001s)]
*  Independence is about this idea that we are entitled to the right of life, liberty and the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=602.64s)]
*  pursuit of happiness and that's- But sorry, congresswoman Crockett, he can't do that. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=610.64s)]
*  Instead, Donald Trump is making long rambling posts like this right now. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=615.12s)]
*  Ed Martin is going through the approval process to be the United States attorney in the District [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=619.36s)]
*  of Columbia according to many, but in particular, R.F.K. Jr., his approval is imperative in terms [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=623.52s)]
*  of doing all that has to be done to save lives and to caps make America healthy again. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=628.24s)]
*  This is a passion for Ed, more so than for almost anyone that I have seen. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=632.8s)]
*  One of the reasons that I was so successful in winning the 2024 presidential election [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=637.28s)]
*  is my commitment to health and helping to make America healthy. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=641.44s)]
*  The cost of chronic disease epidemic has gotten out of control. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=645.36s)]
*  By the way, go watch the Midas Touch podcast where I make a list of all of the essential health [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=649.04s)]
*  services that are being cut right now, including essential services to 9-11 first responders. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=654.48s)]
*  You know when they're cutting health response to 9-11 first responders, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=662.24s)]
*  they're cutting it for everybody as well and lots of people are being devastated. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=667.6s)]
*  Donald Trump's posting, we won two world wars, but we never took credit for it. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=672.5600000000001s)]
*  Everyone else does. I think we did take credit for it. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=677.36s)]
*  All over the world, the allies are celebrating the victory had in World War II. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=679.6800000000001s)]
*  The only country that doesn't celebrate is the United States of America. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=684.0s)]
*  What are you even talking about there? Yes, we do. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=688.32s)]
*  And finally, can I just read for you Donald Trump's response earlier today about Alcatraz? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=691.6s)]
*  I don't want to play the clip. Let me just read it for you. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=698.24s)]
*  I'll just read it word for word. You judge for yourself if this makes any sense. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=702.88s)]
*  Here's Trump's full answer transcribed. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=707.2s)]
*  Well, I guess I was supposed to be a movie maker. We're talking. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=709.2s)]
*  We started with the movie making and we'll end. I mean it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=713.04s)]
*  It represents something very strong, very powerful in terms of law and order. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=716.8s)]
*  Our country needs law and order. Alcatraz is, I would say, the ultimate, right? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=721.04s)]
*  Alcatraz, Sing Sing and Alcatraz, eh? The movies. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=727.1999999999999s)]
*  But it's right now a museum, believe it or not. A lot of people go there. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=730.7199999999999s)]
*  It's housed the most violent criminals in the world and nobody ever escaped. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=735.04s)]
*  One person almost got there, but they, as you know the story, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=739.04s)]
*  they found his clothing rather badly ripped up and it was a lot of shark bites, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=742.24s)]
*  a lot of a lot of problems. Nobody's ever escaped from Alcatraz and [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=746.88s)]
*  just represented something strong having to do with law and order. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=750.8s)]
*  We need law and order in this country and so we're going to look at it. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=754.32s)]
*  Some of the people up here are going to be working very hard on that and [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=757.76s)]
*  we had a little conversation. I think it's going to be very interesting. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=761.92s)]
*  We'll see if we can bring it back in large form and a lot, but I think it represents something. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=764.64s)]
*  Right now it's a big hunk that's sitting there and rusting and rotting. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=769.76s)]
*  You look at it, it's sort of, you know, you saw that picture that was put out. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=774.48s)]
*  It's sort of amazing, but it sort of represents something that's both horrible and beautiful and [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=778.0s)]
*  strong and miserable, weak. It's got a lot of qualities that are interesting and I think they [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=782.64s)]
*  point, okay, there you have it, folks. There you have it. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=789.12s)]
*  We're not going to normalize that ever on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuiu4yP8NA0&t=793.84s)]
