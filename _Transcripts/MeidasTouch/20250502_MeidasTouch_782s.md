# Trump’s COGNITIVE ISSUES Get WORSE and he CAN’T HIDE IT
**MeidasTouch:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs)
*  Back when I was a practicing lawyer and when I was in criminal courts, there was a concept called [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=0.0s)]
*  declaring a doubt where either you or the judge could declare a doubt about a criminal defendant's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  competency and then certain proceedings would take place from there. Well, I'm declaring a doubt [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=12.0s)]
*  right now about Donald Trump's fitness for office. And I'm just going to use examples just over the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  past week. I mean, Donald Trump's disheveled appearance at Pope Francis's funeral where it [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=24.16s)]
*  looked like he was falling asleep. This interview he did with Terry Moran of ABC where it seemed [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=30.16s)]
*  that he didn't even know what the Declaration of Independence is as he lies and claims he has a real [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  copy that's not a real copy in the Oval Office. Watch this moment right here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  It means exactly what it says. It's a declaration. It's a declaration of unity and love and respect. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=54.16s)]
*  And it means a lot. And it's something very special to our country. Lincoln's portrait up there. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=60.64s)]
*  I'm not. You see Terry Moran's face like that's literally not what the Declaration of Independence [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=67.6s)]
*  does. It's the opposite. Then Donald Trump said that the Eagles were at the White House yesterday [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=74.24s)]
*  when they were at the White House on Monday. The space time continuum seems to be reaching [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=80.96s)]
*  a place where Donald Trump doesn't grasp it. Here play this clip. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  I had Ohio State here and I had yesterday the Philadelphia Eagles here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  So they took up a little more room than Gary. I got very good at this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=96.8s)]
*  Okay. But look, there are serious issues as well, though, because fundamentally it seems like [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't even understand the most basic concepts of economics, what tariffs are, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=105.68s)]
*  the way tariffs work. Like here's Donald Trump trying to explain why he thinks China is going [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  to quote eat the one hundred and forty five percent tariffs that have shut down trade as freight [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=119.36000000000001s)]
*  volumes and trucking volumes collapse. Play this clip. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=125.92000000000002s)]
*  Secretary, we basically have an embargo on China. Look, you're trying to say something's going to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=129.52s)]
*  happen. No, no. OK, well, you know, business, I want to ask you. I do know business. And so [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=133.84s)]
*  hundred and forty five percent tariffs on China. And that is basically an embargo. They deserve it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  It'll raise prices on everything from electronics to clothing to building houses. You don't know [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=145.12s)]
*  that. You don't know whether or not China is going to get mathematics. China probably will eat those [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=150.4s)]
*  tariffs. But at one hundred and forty five, they basically can't do much business with the United [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=154.72s)]
*  States. And they were making from us a trillion dollars a year. They were ripping us off like [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=158.88s)]
*  nobody's ever ripped us off. And by the way, we have other countries that were just as bad. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=164.72s)]
*  If you look at the European Union, it was terrible what they've done to us. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=169.12s)]
*  Every country, almost every country in the world was ripping us off. They're not doing that anymore. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=172.72s)]
*  I want you to think. And Donald Trump made an appearance on News Nation where Stephen A. Smith, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=177.68s)]
*  I guess, is on News Nation now. I don't know. Ask Donald Trump a question about how the Trump regime [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=183.84s)]
*  is attacking Harvard, Harvard. And Donald Trump says that he likes Harlem and then talks about [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=189.6s)]
*  getting the black vote here. Watch this time, Mr. President. Thank you for your time. It's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=198.4s)]
*  interesting that you brought up Harvard, because when people think about Harvard, what they're [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=203.6s)]
*  basically talking about is they're asking what do you say to those who view your actions as an attack [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=207.84s)]
*  on academic freedom rather than a defense of fairness? What do you say to that? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=213.6s)]
*  Well, I say this. We had riots in Harlem and in Harlem. And frankly, if you look at what's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=219.2s)]
*  gone on and people from Harlem went up and they protested, Stephen, and they protested very [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=226.32s)]
*  strongly against Harvard, they happen to be on my side. You know, I got a very high black vote. You [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=231.6s)]
*  know that. Very, very high black. Let's bring in Democratic Congress member [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=238.24s)]
*  Raja Krishnamoorth. It was a long lead-in to bringing you on here, but I think it was [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=244.48s)]
*  worth it. Well, I declare a doubt. Do you, sir, declare a doubt? I echo your doubt and I raise [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=250.56s)]
*  further doubts. He is off, man. I mean, this is... And not only is he off, but his policies are just [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=257.76s)]
*  downright nefarious. And I think that probably Stephen Miller and folks like that are really [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=266.64s)]
*  pulling the strings. They are the architects of deportations of two-year-old babies and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=273.12s)]
*  four-year-old citizens without due process, things that just make my constituents... [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  Angry is an understatement. Outraged, beyond belief, is probably closer to their sentiments [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=289.28s)]
*  right now. You know, when I spoke with Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, he says when he travels [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=295.68s)]
*  around the country that people always ask about just Donald Trump's behavior, because it's not [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=300.88s)]
*  really being talked about on the corporate news, but we see it. Like, we see it. Like, when he says [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=308.32s)]
*  that his administration won nine to zero in front of the Supreme Court, that he doesn't have to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=314.56s)]
*  return to Braco Garcia, and it says nine to zero, you have to facilitate the return. You lose, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=321.68s)]
*  facilitate the return. I think people are just disgusted. When Trump says he's doing 200 trade [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=328.96s)]
*  deals or that they're done and there's not even 200 countries, people are like, whoa, this guy's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=336.64s)]
*  running it. Speak to that, but speak to what you're seeing in the first 100 days of the real harm [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=344.72s)]
*  all this crap is causing your constituents and the people in this country. Another good example [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=351.12s)]
*  is he says that he's quote unquote talking to China. He's in negotiations with China over this [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=356.0s)]
*  145 percent tariff that he's imposed, and they impose a 125 percent tax on our exports, and then [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=361.2s)]
*  they the next day say, what talks? What negotiations? What are you referring to? We haven't talked at all. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=370.32s)]
*  And so I fear that he is living in another universe. He's out of touch with reality, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  and meanwhile others behind the scenes are basically carrying out a set of policies that are [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=386.0s)]
*  basically chaotic, to say the least. Just on the tariff front, as you know, it's hiking prices [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=393.04s)]
*  across the board. I visited a small business that imports fruits, flowers, and vegetables, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=401.36s)]
*  and they basically said we have to pay at least a 10 percent tariff. That's going to translate into [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=406.24s)]
*  a 10 percent tax on working families who have to buy this these fruits, flowers, and vegetables [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=412.32s)]
*  at their grocery store. I visited a soybean farmer. He said not only is he paying more for his [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=420.0s)]
*  inputs because of these tariffs on fertilizer and such that's coming from Canada, but he's also [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=425.6s)]
*  facing retaliation tariffs from China and other countries. So he gets the double whammy, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=432.48s)]
*  and then finally people are outraged about the cuts that are about to happen in Medicaid, as well [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=438.88s)]
*  as the cuts that are happening with Social Security and Medicare, given the layoffs and the gutting of [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=444.24s)]
*  the Social Security Administration. And so people are just up in arms, and I think that's why [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump is as unpopular now as he is. The most unpopular ever, objectively, based on all of the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=454.71999999999997s)]
*  wide range of polls, everything from Fox to Pew to Ipsos, you know, and people are pissed, but your [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=465.76s)]
*  colleagues, the MAGA Republicans in the House, they are doing whatever Donald Trump tells them to do, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=472.32s)]
*  and they're doing weird things at the hearing now too. They're not engaging and even having [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=480.56s)]
*  communications with them. They have a new policy. We don't respond right to what Democrats are saying, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=487.2s)]
*  and so when Democrats are like, hey, can we talk about this? They just go silent, and so the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=493.2s)]
*  Democrats are like, so you're not going to even acknowledge that we even exist? Silence. And then [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=498.4s)]
*  they just go one by one like robots. They pre-programmed AI and just knock out whatever [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=504.48s)]
*  Trump tells them to. Can you speak to that behavior? I don't think that's getting enough [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=512.64s)]
*  attention. I saw it yesterday in the Oversight Committee, which is kind of generally being [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=516.48s)]
*  conducted like a circus these days by Jim Comer, but basically what happened was yesterday, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=522.16s)]
*  you know, one of the, I think it was Scott Perry or somebody else engaged in some very strong [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=531.12s)]
*  remarks, which I found very objectionable. Our side, you know, inquired, made a parliamentary [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=538.0s)]
*  inquiry or inquired about what the heck he's talking about, and they wouldn't respond, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=543.8399999999999s)]
*  and this is kind of par for the course. Going to your other issue about kind of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=548.88s)]
*  sticking to the party line, I think the reason why they do that more than anything else is Elon [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=554.4s)]
*  Musk. They fear Elon Musk and his money. We've not seen this amount of money being poured into [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=559.44s)]
*  elections by one individual in a very long time, and so Elon Musk is kind of enforcing party [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=565.6800000000001s)]
*  discipline, if you will, for Donald Trump, and he also controls a megaphone for President Trump. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=572.96s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is when Medicaid is on the chopping block or Social Security and Medicare [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=582.1600000000001s)]
*  are on the chopping block, I guarantee you these people only have one of two choices, either side [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=586.8s)]
*  with your constituents or side with Donald Trump and Elon Musk, and if they do the latter, we have [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=591.68s)]
*  to hold them accountable. So talk about that last piece of it, you know, obviously Democrats still [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=596.64s)]
*  not in the majority. I mean, you know, we've seen generic polling shift showing that Democrats, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=603.1999999999999s)]
*  you know, have a real opportunity here, but what are we doing? You know, what are you doing? What [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=609.8399999999999s)]
*  are we doing? What should people be doing now that we're past that 100 day mark? I unfortunately [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=614.64s)]
*  think things are going to get worse. I think this moment is the tsunami where the shores recede. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  We're seeing how the freight volumes are down, trucking volumes are down, the products aren't [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=628.08s)]
*  getting here. This feels very COVID-esque where Trump's like a miracle. It's all going to go away. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=634.24s)]
*  I'm seeing what's about to hit. It's about to hit. There's going to be a Tom Hanks moment, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=640.4000000000001s)]
*  pretty right where it's like, oh shit, we got this thing. Like it's going to be something missing and [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=646.72s)]
*  then people are going to, I think, panic. What can we do? How do we prepare, Congressman? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, look, you've heard of artificial intelligence. I think what you see right [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=656.8000000000001s)]
*  now in the White House is just natural stupidity. And we know we're headed for a recession. We know [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=660.08s)]
*  these tariffs caused in part kind of the shrinkage of the economy in the first quarter of the year. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=665.28s)]
*  And then there was quote unquote liberation day, which piled more tariffs on top of previous tariffs. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpzQ9P1ghs&t=674.72s)]
