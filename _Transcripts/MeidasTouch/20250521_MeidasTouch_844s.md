# Trump goes NUTS as World Leaders MOCK HIM to his FACE
**MeidasTouch:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y)
*  The world is mocking Donald Trump. Our enemies are laughing in his face. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Our allies, who Donald Trump has pushed away when he's isolated, the United States, are horrified. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=5.84s)]
*  Take a look at some of the recent headlines. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  You have China making an announcement asking the United States to maintain stability of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=15.76s)]
*  international financial system after the Moody's downgrade. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=21.2s)]
*  China literally mocking the United States as though it was like a banana republic, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=25.919999999999998s)]
*  and China saying, we're just trying to maintain the stability of the international financial system, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=30.64s)]
*  Donald. Can you make it a little more stable for the rest of us? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=35.68s)]
*  Don't you realize that China is behaving the way the United States used to behave, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=39.2s)]
*  and the United States is behaving how China used to behave or how North Korea is behaving right now? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=44.4s)]
*  One of the things we learned as well when Donald Trump had that phone call with Vladimir [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=51.28s)]
*  Putin early in the week, one of the things that Vladimir Putin was doing to mock Donald Trump, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=55.68s)]
*  was Putin took that call at some random elementary school in southern Russia to make the point that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=61.68s)]
*  he didn't even give a crap about the phone call. And then when he spoke to Russian press, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=69.12s)]
*  he made it very clear that he wanted to see the total elimination of Ukraine while Donald Trump [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=74.56s)]
*  was out there saying, oh, we made progress. No, you didn't. You completely caved and capitulated [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=80.96s)]
*  is what happened. Here's what Putin said from inside the elementary school where he took the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=86.96s)]
*  phone call from Donald Trump. Here, play this clip. Russia's position is clear. The main thing for us [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=92.55999999999999s)]
*  is to eliminate the root causes of this crisis. You take a look at what Garry Kasparov, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=100.56s)]
*  a Russian pro-democracy leader, a dissident from Russia, had to say about the whole setting and the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=106.0s)]
*  message that Putin was sending by taking the call in an elementary school. And Kasparov knows, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=113.52s)]
*  or Kasparov knows, you know, the way Putin's propaganda works. He goes, he was laughing [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  and mocking Donald Trump. Here's what Kasparov had to say, play this clip. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=126.56s)]
*  Putin was laughing at him. He didn't even just come back to Moscow. He spoke to him from a music [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  school in the obscure place in the south of Russia. Do you think that matters too, where he took the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=137.68s)]
*  call from? Of course, Putin shows disdain. Putin enjoys it. I mean, you can see the body language. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=142.24s)]
*  And also, dictator has to show his strength. He's playing, you know, the... So he's talking to him [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  from a music school somewhere. But it's also a message to Russia and to many others, you know, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=151.44s)]
*  other dictators in the world. Trump is nobody. I mean, look, you know, I can play the American [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=157.6s)]
*  president as a broken guitar. And Donald Trump is so much of an idiot that when Trump gave his press [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  conference, he was saying, well, you know, Putin kept on talking about my wife, Melania. And he [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=168.72s)]
*  was saying how respected she is. Here's what Donald Trump had to say, play this clip. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=174.96s)]
*  Compassionate first lady, I would tell you, she is very dedicated. In fact, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=179.68s)]
*  if you look at just what I heard, Putin just said they respect your wife a lot. I said, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=186.24s)]
*  what about me? No, they will. They like, they like Melania better. That wasn't good. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=190.8s)]
*  I don't know if that was good. I'm okay with it. I'm okay. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  And then Donald Trump held another press conference earlier yesterday, where Donald Trump [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=200.0s)]
*  basically said that he wasn't going to do anything anymore regarding Russia and Ukraine, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=205.76s)]
*  that it's basically he's done. He was there's lots of big egos involved here. And really, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=212.56s)]
*  this is a European deal anyway. I'm not going to do anything here. Play this clip. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=218.32s)]
*  Big egos involved. I tell you, big egos involved. But I think something's going to happen. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=223.28s)]
*  And if it doesn't, I just back away and they're going to have to keep going. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=228.72s)]
*  Again, this was a European situation. It should have remained a European situation. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=232.8s)]
*  You said you were going to end the war in 24 hours. That was your promise that you ran on. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=238.8s)]
*  And I want to be clear, I'm glad a lot of the press is coming around to this realization now, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  after printing the BS headlines that Donald Trump had like accomplished something, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=250.88000000000002s)]
*  that the press is coming around to the fact that no, Donald Trump completely capitulated. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  And he says it's too hard for him to negotiate anymore. So he just wants to have Ukraine and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=260.4s)]
*  Russia deal with themselves directly. But here's what Donald Trump said repeatedly during the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=266.08s)]
*  campaign. Let's play this clip. End the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. Yes, I can. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=270.56s)]
*  How would you do that? I know Zelensky very well. I'll end that war between those two countries in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=275.28s)]
*  24 hours. It won't even take that long. I will get the war ended. I'll stop all of those lives [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=281.52s)]
*  from being wasted and lost. And there'll be no more bombing of Ukraine. Now, to be clear, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=289.52s)]
*  what Donald Trump wants to happen is Trump wants to do financial deals with Putin directly. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=297.12s)]
*  And what Trump is hoping that if he removes the United States from these destructions, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  from these discussions, and turns a blind eye to what's taking place, Putin can commit the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=308.64s)]
*  genocide that he wants to commit. And again, yesterday, more missiles coming in from Russia [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=315.04s)]
*  into Ukraine, targeting innocent Ukrainians. That's what was going down. So Donald Trump went to the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=324.48s)]
*  Capitol Hill yesterday, showing more loser behavior there. By the way, in this moment, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=331.76s)]
*  Donald Trump appears to walk straight into a wall. Just watch what he does right here. Play this clip. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=338.64s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. And while Donald Trump was there on Capitol Hill, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=347.36s)]
*  he was asked a question. Do you want these budget negotiations to just end? And he was confused. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=355.68s)]
*  What negotiation? What's going on? The budget negotiations. That's why you're on Capitol Hill [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=362.56s)]
*  right now. You're on Capitol Hill because there's a faction of MAGA Republicans who want further cuts [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=367.6s)]
*  to Medicaid, and there's a faction of MAGA Republicans who don't like the optics of cutting [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=373.12s)]
*  Medicaid, and there's a faction of MAGA Republicans who want to raise the cap from the state and local [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=379.20000000000005s)]
*  tax deductions that you put on during your first term. And then Donald Trump, when he's answering [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=386.72s)]
*  these questions, just starts randomly attacking blue states. Play this clip. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  Do you want the negotiations to be over on our... [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  What's your negotiation? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  Over this bill? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=398.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, well it's going to be. We're going to be putting it in soon, and I think we're going to have [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=399.44s)]
*  great support. We're going to make a couple of tweaks. I mean, we don't want to benefit [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=402.4s)]
*  Democrat governors, although I would do that if it made it better, but they don't know what they're [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=408.88s)]
*  doing. We don't want to do any damage to a state. We want to help all the states, but we have [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=412.48s)]
*  governors that are from the Democrat part of, let's say, New York, Illinois, big ones, and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=420.64s)]
*  let's say Gavin Newsom, who's done a horrible job in California. We want to benefit the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=426.64s)]
*  Republicans because they are the ones that are going to make America great again. The Democrats [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=433.2s)]
*  are destroying our country, and you see that with the past administration, with an open borders [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  policy that allowed 21 million people into our country, and many of those people are stone cold [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=443.2s)]
*  murderers, killers, and trouble. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=449.36s)]
*  By the way, it's just so utterly unhinged when you look through Donald Trump's social media platform, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=451.92s)]
*  like the ads, like this Anuvia dental implants. This is what you see in between Donald Trump's [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=457.92s)]
*  posts. And then so here's Donald Trump's new post. After the MAGA Republicans spread all of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=463.12s)]
*  these conspiracies about 5G and 6G, wasn't that like their whole big conspiracy? 5G, 6G. MAGA [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=468.72s)]
*  now apparently loves 5G. Donald Trump's post. We must maintain our status as the worldwide leader [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=476.08s)]
*  in Wi-Fi, 5G, and 6G, connecting every American to the world's best networks. Well then, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  if that's the case, then why are you ripping apart former President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=488.88s)]
*  and Infrastructure Act as well that would further 5G and 6G networks? Speaking though of like [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  how MAGA just changes their positions on everything. So the deputy director of the FBI, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=504.16s)]
*  Dan Bongino, I can't believe I'm even saying that, who was a deranged right wing podcast guy [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=511.28s)]
*  who would do the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracies and do all the cabal conspiracies. Bongino was the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=519.6s)]
*  worst. But now Bongino is the deputy FBI director and he's like, nope, I've looked at the Epstein [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=528.0s)]
*  files and I can confirm that it was definitely, he definitely died by suicide. And it was not any of [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=534.0s)]
*  the conspiracies that what we previously spread. As our editor in chief Ron Filipkowski says, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=540.48s)]
*  on the left is how you build a right wing talk show audience. And on the right, after becoming [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=546.16s)]
*  deputy FBI director, here play this clip. Listen, that Jeffrey Epstein story is a big deal. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=551.6s)]
*  Please do not let that story go. Keep your eye on this. Catherine Rumler, I want you, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=558.24s)]
*  we need to keep the heat on this case, folks. There are a lot of people who are knee deep in [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=563.44s)]
*  the Washington swamp who are not telling you the truth about serious allegations out there that [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=568.24s)]
*  Epstein may have had video and audio of people out there doing things they shouldn't have been [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=575.12s)]
*  doing. And you should be asking yourself the question, how is it that all these people, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=580.8s)]
*  the CIA director, the Obama fixer, Bill Clinton, all intersected past with Jeffrey Epstein, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=584.72s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein isn't with us anymore. And nobody seems to want to talk about it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=590.64s)]
*  Outside of a few entrepreneurial media outlets saying, Hey, this is a big deal. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=595.76s)]
*  He killed himself. You again, you want me to, I've, I've seen the whole file. He killed himself. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  And the lies just keep coming in from Donald Trump. Yesterday during Donald Trump's press [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=606.64s)]
*  conference, he claimed that even if the budget bill adds trillions of dollars to the deficit, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=612.96s)]
*  he goes, no worries. He says that he brought in $5.1 trillion in the last four days in the [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=619.36s)]
*  Middle East, which of course is an absolute lie. Here play this clip. When you first announced this [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=627.44s)]
*  idea, critics said it would be prohibitively expensive, potentially ineffective and could [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=633.0400000000001s)]
*  trigger an arms race in space. What do you say to those critics about that? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=638.72s)]
*  Well, the wrong is about as close to perfect as you can have in terms of real production. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=642.64s)]
*  I told you Canada wants to be a part of it, which be, you know, fairly small expansion, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=649.12s)]
*  but we'll work with them on pricing. We'll be dealing with them on pricing. They know [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=654.64s)]
*  about it very much. They've asked to be a part of it. Actually, they've asked us to be a part of it. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=658.96s)]
*  But I think it's something that is great. If you can afford to do it, we can afford to do it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=663.52s)]
*  You know, we took in $5.1 trillion in the last four days in the Middle East. And when you think [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=670.16s)]
*  about it, this is a tiny fraction of that, but we make it all here. We're going to make it all here. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=676.64s)]
*  I will tell you, an adversary told me, a very big adversary, told me the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=684.48s)]
*  most brilliant people in the world are Silicon Valley. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=689.1999999999999s)]
*  You didn't bring in any money, if I'm being completely candid. You have commitments, but also [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=692.3199999999999s)]
*  there's no commitment for $5 trillion. The entire Qatar GDP is $200 billion, the United Arab Emirates [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=698.88s)]
*  $400 billion. Saudi Arabia's entire GDP is $1.1 trillion. They're not giving their entire annual [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=706.3199999999999s)]
*  GDP for multiple years based on a meeting. It's just more lies after lies after lies. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=714.88s)]
*  I think this guy, Justin Wolfer, economist professor at University of Michigan, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=723.2s)]
*  I think puts it, he has this graph. He's like total deals done by Donald Trump in 90 days. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=728.48s)]
*  And he does the chart. Zero actual deals done in 90 days that are actually binding. The UK deal, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=734.24s)]
*  not a real deal, not binding. It literally says this is not a binding deal on the bottom of it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=740.96s)]
*  Okay. So it wasn't even a real big deal. China, not a deal. It was a consensus where the United [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=746.1600000000001s)]
*  States caved and capitulated to China and just withdrew 145% tariffs to 35% tariffs, which are [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=752.4000000000001s)]
*  still incredibly, incredibly harmful. And now you see the 30 year treasury yields look like they're [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=761.2s)]
*  going to hit a five handle. It looks like they're going to hit 5%. And now China is lecturing the [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=767.84s)]
*  United States on financial stability in the international markets. Like, do you know how [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=772.5600000000001s)]
*  embarrassing, like it's so utterly embarrassing. And here's the message from Germany's foreign [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=778.1600000000001s)]
*  minister. We expect our US allies not to tolerate the fact that Russia did not impose an immediate [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=785.36s)]
*  ceasefire. That's coming from Germany's foreign minister because just everywhere around the world, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=793.84s)]
*  they're seeing how weak and pathetic Donald Trump is. And they're all just saying like, what the [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=801.0400000000001s)]
*  hell is even going on? Like what in the world is going on there in the United States right now? So [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=805.76s)]
*  Donald Trump will make his post. I want a gift. Give me, you know, come on, Ben, give me. I'm [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=812.8000000000001s)]
*  giving you a MAGA award. I have to hit my fundraising goals. Fundraising for what? What the hell are you [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=819.2s)]
*  even talking about? Again, this is the most weak and pathetic presidency I've ever seen. Let me know [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oCyPHV1z-Y&t=824.5600000000001s)]
