# Trump RUNS TO GOLF and gets HUMILIATED on SATURDAY
**MeidasTouch:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E)
*  Surprise, surprise, Donald Trump has run back into his bunker this weekend at Bedminster, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=0.0s)]
*  New Jersey, where he will be playing golf on the taxpayers' dime while the entire world [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=6.58s)]
*  is mocking him. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=12.620000000000001s)]
*  The keyboard warrior Donald Trump on this Saturday, he's been posting away on social [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=14.24s)]
*  media on Instagram pictures that make him look tough. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=21.46s)]
*  Like he posted this photo of ICE agents and Border Patrol agents and National Guard, who [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=27.020000000000003s)]
*  he has federalized, all in their military uniforms, and it goes, we show up, we stand [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=34.260000000000005s)]
*  firm, we carry out the mission despite the noise. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=40.94s)]
*  When you go through this video, they're entering into the Santa Fe Springs Swap Meet, where [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=45.58s)]
*  it says Family Fun Live Music Shopping, open six days a week. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=52.06s)]
*  Oh, tough guys dressed in your military uniforms going into the Santa Fe Swap Meet, while Donald [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=58.14s)]
*  Trump says emails, sends emails like the following, Ben, our once great American cities like Los [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=64.58s)]
*  Angeles have been invaded and occupied by illegal aliens and criminals. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=70.9s)]
*  So I came up with this idea after watching insurrectionist mobs try and sabotage our [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=76.30000000000001s)]
*  deportation operations. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=82.78s)]
*  And then you click the idea and guess what it says is click here for the idea. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=85.34s)]
*  Then it says you got to donate money to Donald Trump. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=89.58000000000001s)]
*  While Donald Trump is hiding in his bunker, little bunker boy today on Saturday, as I [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=92.9s)]
*  said, the world is mocking him. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=98.34s)]
*  The Japanese have canceled a critical meeting with Donald Trump that was scheduled for July [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=100.62s)]
*  1st because they don't want to be seen around him before the upper chamber and the Japanese [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=107.18s)]
*  legislature holds their election on July 20th. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=113.86s)]
*  Also you have people in the Trump regime Department of Defense who keep on changing the deal requests [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  of Japan. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=124.42s)]
*  Oh, we want you to spend 3% more, 3.5% more of defense spending. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=125.58s)]
*  And Japan's like, just shut up. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=130.54s)]
*  We don't even want to see. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=131.9s)]
*  We don't even see or hear you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=133.26s)]
*  And you're embarrassing to us. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=134.78s)]
*  And you'll harm the ability of the liberal Democratic Party to keep the seats. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=136.3s)]
*  It's already expected to lose on July 20th. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=141.74s)]
*  You had India Prime Minister Modi reject an invite to the White House this past week. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=144.62s)]
*  And on the Russian state propaganda TV, you want to see what they're doing right now? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=151.1s)]
*  Well, here they are basically saying they're mocking Donald Trump for leaving the G7 like [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=155.66s)]
*  a baby. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=161.22s)]
*  And they're like, it seems like he was like a like a drunk, like a little sad, pathetic [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=162.29999999999998s)]
*  little boy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=167.38s)]
*  And this Russian state TV propaganda, this comes from Putin. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=168.78s)]
*  Let me show you the first clip of what's going on right now in Russian TV. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=172.5s)]
*  You won't see this in the United States. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Fox and everyone. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  They'll pretend, oh, America's strong, projecting strength. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=179.62s)]
*  They are laughing at us throughout the world. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=182.58s)]
*  Here play this clip right here. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=184.94s)]
*  Now let's look at the body language. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=186.46s)]
*  Trump left the G7 fleeing as if he'd been hit with a dusty sack. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=188.34s)]
*  If I didn't know his personal history, that he hasn't drunk all his life, I'd have the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=192.1s)]
*  full impression that he was drunk. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=195.86s)]
*  He was in a groggy state. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=197.68s)]
*  And want to know one of the other things that they're mocking us for in Russia and frankly, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=199.82s)]
*  the entire world. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=204.66s)]
*  And by the way, they're right to do so. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=205.7s)]
*  And it pains me to say this, that Donald Trump keeps talking about building gigantic flag [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=208.82s)]
*  poles in front of the North and South lawn of the White House. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=214.73999999999998s)]
*  And even this Russian propagandist is like, the whole world thought that Donald Trump, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=219.26s)]
*  he said, I have a major speech to give. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=223.42s)]
*  I'm coming out to let you know how I think about these issues. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=224.89999999999998s)]
*  And the Russian propagandist is like, everybody thought he was going to say, what are we going [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=227.78s)]
*  to be doing with Iran? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=232.22s)]
*  Because he's been saying, I'm going to kill the Ayatollah. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=233.7s)]
*  Everybody evacuate Tehran now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=237.26s)]
*  And then this guy goes, the Russian guy goes, and he goes out there and he starts talking [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=239.38s)]
*  about big polls and he's putting up a poll in the White House. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=243.86s)]
*  You can't even believe this. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=247.3s)]
*  Here's what the Russian propaganda TV is saying to mock the US now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=249.14s)]
*  And by the way, they're not just doing this in Russia. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=252.74s)]
*  This is going on throughout the world. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=254.42s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=255.78s)]
*  CNN says Trump will make a serious speech. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=256.78s)]
*  Trump comes out and says, I have decided in the lawn of the White House. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=260.68s)]
*  I am placing two flagpoles on the left and right. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  They are wonderful, beautiful flagpoles with a cable inside for raising the flag. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=268.88s)]
*  I already explained this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=273.56s)]
*  Explained. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=275.44s)]
*  I mean, he was really telling. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=276.44s)]
*  It is a great honor for me to announce and always that's all that I will install two [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=277.44s)]
*  beautiful flagpoles on both sides of the White House on the North and South lawns. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=283.86s)]
*  This is the only order of Trump that will be fulfilled. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=289.64s)]
*  Yes, it's really like now. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=292.08s)]
*  Wait, wait, is this serious? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  The people, everyone is waiting. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=298.28s)]
*  So what you're probably referring to the fact that you're going to bomb Iran now. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=300.64s)]
*  What flagpoles? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=308.12s)]
*  But such astonished journalists ask him, Frederick, wait, what are you talking about now? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=310.4s)]
*  So naturally, Donald Trump is posting on Instagram while he's being a little bunker [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=317.4s)]
*  boy this weekend, more videos of the gigantic poll that he's putting in the White House [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=322.0s)]
*  North and South lawns, turning it into just a completely and utter eyesore. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  Speaking of a complete and utter eyesore, what are they doing in the White House now [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=334.79999999999995s)]
*  while Trump's in Benminster, New Jersey, golfing, destroying the Rose Garden? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  The Rose Garden is officially gone at the White House. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=343.4s)]
*  It has been bulldozed over. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=347.16s)]
*  Concrete has been placed on it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  Look, starting a new business can be intimidating. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=352.0s)]

*  I'm saying that they have nuclear weapons and that there's going to be potentially [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=483.88s)]
*  a nuclear bomb hitting the United States of America, that if the United States doesn't [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=489.15999999999997s)]
*  act within days, they said days ago, that America is going to be obliterated by Iran. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=494.2s)]
*  But Donald Trump says, I got to go golf. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=500.55999999999995s)]
*  I got to go build some poles. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=502.76s)]
*  I got to spend taxpayer money getting rid of the Rose Garden, putting up poles. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=504.44s)]
*  What else? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  Playing golf on the taxpayer dime. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=513.12s)]
*  Here's what Pete Hegseth's doing though. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=515.0799999999999s)]
*  He's working hard preparing for war in the Middle East. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=516.48s)]
*  He is smashing and posting about it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=519.76s)]
*  This is what he's posting about. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=523.28s)]
*  Smashing watermelons. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=525.56s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=526.56s)]
*  One, two, three. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=528.28s)]
*  What else is Donald Trump doing today? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=536.28s)]
*  Oh, they're posting about their disastrous budget bill. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=537.76s)]
*  This bill will prevent the largest tax increase in American history. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=541.0s)]
*  We're going to scare all of you. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=546.72s)]
*  Okay, the people get that your disastrous budget bill is the biggest gift to billionaires [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=549.2s)]
*  and decamillionaires who are going to get trillions of dollars in tax cuts, literally [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=557.2s)]
*  stealing the money from low-income and working-class people. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=561.96s)]
*  And all of the stuff you said, no tax on Social Security, that's not in a bill. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=565.88s)]
*  And you want to talk about no tax on tips, no tax on overtime. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=569.64s)]
*  The way the Senate bill currently looks, they have so many exceptions on no tax on tips [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=573.24s)]
*  and no tax on overtime as it to not make a dent on people's lives at all, who, by the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=578.28s)]
*  way, will get screwed even worse by their health care being taken away. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=584.72s)]
*  So now they're going to have to go out of pocket on that, which they're not going to [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=589.04s)]
*  be able to afford. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=591.48s)]
*  Inability to afford homes, inflation increasing, Donald Trump's tariffs. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=592.96s)]
*  And literally, if you look at the structure of this disastrous budget bill, if you are [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=597.24s)]
*  making under $50,000, you give 1,000 of your dollars to somebody making more than $4.2 [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=601.72s)]
*  million, who gets a $426,000 check back to them by literally stealing it from low-income [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=610.24s)]
*  Americans. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=619.36s)]
*  That's the structure of this thing. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=620.36s)]
*  It's very easy. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=622.08s)]
*  Ro Khanna, Democratic Congress member who represents Silicon Valley, the richest Americans [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=623.24s)]
*  live in Silicon Valley. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=628.52s)]
*  Democratic Congress member Ro Khanna says, tax the rich more. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=630.36s)]
*  We could start with fairly because they're not being taxed fairly, but tax the rich more. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  He goes, if I could say it in my district, why can't people say it in other districts [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=639.32s)]
*  as well? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=643.64s)]
*  The American people get a look at the comments on this Instagram post that Trump made. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=644.64s)]
*  Every single person has stated that this will increase the deficit by trillions of dollars. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=650.0400000000001s)]
*  You are doing Trump math. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=655.96s)]
*  Stop pretending that you're doing this for the American people. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=657.72s)]
*  We aren't stupid. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=659.9200000000001s)]
*  Huge tax increase for middle class and lower to feed the rich. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=661.5600000000001s)]
*  Stop screwing over the working class. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=667.32s)]
*  Don't sell 250 million acres of our public lands, please. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=669.72s)]
*  And that's an important point. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=675.08s)]
*  We are stealing 250 million acres of our public lands to turn it over for rich people [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=676.8s)]
*  so that the rich people can basically acquire the lands for themselves of our public lands [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=683.28s)]
*  so that they could have their kind of vanity mansions out there. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=689.1999999999999s)]
*  Oh, Donald Trump sent this email today. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=693.52s)]
*  Trump might wear this on the 4th of July. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=696.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's a Make America Great Again hat. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=699.76s)]
*  Oh, and this is an important message to all the Trump supporters that Donald Trump sent yesterday. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=703.24s)]
*  Ben, I made a big decision at the White House just now. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=708.76s)]
*  Big decision. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=712.4399999999999s)]
*  In consultation with my trusted advisors like my son Don Jr. and our great Vice President [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=713.4399999999999s)]
*  J.D. Vance, I made the call to open a few more highly selective spots for Trump cabinet [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=720.76s)]
*  level advisory council. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=727.68s)]
*  And the first one is going to you. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=730.04s)]
*  I mean, the people who are getting this email think that they've become cabinet members [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=733.0s)]
*  by donating hundreds of their dollars, hundreds of dollars to Donald Trump. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=738.12s)]
*  And why are they donating money to Donald Trump? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=742.68s)]
*  What's he running for? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=744.7199999999999s)]
*  They're giving him money so that they can get a fake cabinet position. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=745.7199999999999s)]
*  Oh, and his son Don Jr. is apparently working in the government now. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=749.3199999999999s)]
*  I didn't know that that Don Jr. was was actually an official American advisor while selling [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=753.52s)]
*  club memberships for something called the executive branch. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=761.52s)]
*  Literally, they have a club, Don Jr., called the executive branch, half a million dollars [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=765.24s)]
*  to enter Don Jr. and the crypto czar David Sachs. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=770.04s)]
*  Oh, so that's interesting. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=774.04s)]
*  Is that an admission right there that that you actually are selling executive branch [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=775.04s)]
*  access? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8rAmjsWf-E&t=781.76s)]
