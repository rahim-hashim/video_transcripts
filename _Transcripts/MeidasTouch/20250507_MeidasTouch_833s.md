# WEAK Trump CRACKS UNDER PRESSURE as WAR STARTS
**MeidasTouch:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE)
*  India and Pakistan are now at war with each other. The United States lost another F-18 jet in the Red Sea. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=0.0s)]
*  It was the second jet that was lost recently. We've had multiple drones that were downed over Yemen. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=8.4s)]
*  Ukraine has not seen the peace in 24 hours that Donald Trump promised he was going to negotiate. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=14.8s)]
*  He still no deals Donald. He's negotiated zero deals with his trade war against the world. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=21.84s)]
*  Now he says he may just unilaterally impose his own deals by making up numbers and calling that a deal, which is not a deal. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=28.8s)]
*  Donald Trump has caused massive instability around the world. He's caused economic chaos here at home. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=38.0s)]
*  Main Street is suffering. He's manipulating the markets on an almost daily basis. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=45.36s)]
*  And what has he been talking about? What has he been focused on? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=51.6s)]
*  Well, he announced that the US is going to start to call the Persian Gulf the Arabian Gulf. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=54.88s)]
*  So this was a major, major announcement that he wanted to make before he traveled to the Middle East to meet with Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, and other countries who are doing personal deals with Donald Trump, enriching Donald Trump while we the people suffer. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=61.28s)]
*  Donald Trump is also announcing that he has appointed Rudy Giuliani's kid, Andrew Giuliani, as the executive director of the president's task force on the 2026 FIFA World Cup. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=82.64s)]
*  Donald Trump was having a press conference about the 2026 FIFA World Cup while India and Pakistan went to war with each other, with India striking inside the Kashmir region, an area is controlled by Pakistan. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=96.4s)]
*  The first time that's taken place in several decades, the ceasefire there is now over. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=112.08s)]
*  And when Donald Trump and his secretary of state Marco Rubio finally addressed the war now between India and Pakistan, they said, you know, we just hope that it resolves quickly. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=118.32s)]
*  We hope that it goes away soon and that it resolves quickly. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=129.2s)]
*  So they spent the past four years attacking former President Biden and everything. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=132.32s)]
*  But now with them, it's, you know, we just hope maybe the war goes away quickly. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=137.36s)]
*  You know, they'll just deal with it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=141.28s)]
*  By the way, the Trump regime is hiding casualty numbers from a real war that's taking place right now between the United States and the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=143.44s)]
*  The Trump regime is not calling it a real war because they don't want to get congressional approval. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  But for all purposes, there's a real war and they've decided not to provide any data of what's really going on there. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=160.88s)]
*  And of course, you know, from all of our prior reporting and the reporting by The Atlantic and others that Pete Hegza and Mike Walls, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=168.4s)]
*  they were having all of these communications about Yemen on their text message threads where they invited a reporter. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=178.88s)]
*  We know that there have been dozens of other signal chats that they've engaged in with sensitive classified information. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=186.72s)]
*  Who knows what the Chinese government has, what adversaries have, what the Houthis have on the United States right now. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=195.28s)]
*  Let me take you right now inside India's NDTV. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  Here's how they describe Operation Sindor. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=211.6s)]
*  I am told that Operation Sindor is only in its first phase right now. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  There could be more attacks. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  There could be more attacks against Pakistani targets. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=220.64s)]
*  Now, as I mentioned at the outset of this video, another F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet from the USS Harry S. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=224.72s)]
*  Truman aircraft carrier has been lost at the Red Sea after it suffered an arrestment failure while trying to land. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=231.2s)]
*  Two aviators were ejected with minor injuries. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=238.16s)]
*  This is the second jet loss from the carrier in just over a week. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=241.2s)]
*  Four people familiar with the matter told CNN the way we get this, by the way, is from like sources inside because the Trump regime is not [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=245.6s)]
*  transparent with any of this data. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=254.0s)]
*  The Department of Defense, though, was talking about this yesterday. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=256.64s)]
*  Secretary of Defense, we are leaving wokeness and weakness behind. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=260.4s)]
*  No more pronouns, no more climate change obsessions, no more emergency vaccine mandates, no more dudes in dresses. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=264.48s)]
*  We are done with that shit. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=273.44s)]
*  That's from the official Department of Defense account. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=276.0s)]
*  And as I mentioned in the Intercept report, the US government is keeping American casualty numbers for the undeclared war on Yemen secret. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=280.72s)]
*  This is not normal, not one bit. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=289.2s)]
*  As Don Winslow said, boy, don't you just feel safer under Donald Trump? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=292.48s)]
*  Israel bombing Gaza and now saying that they're going to just take it all over and move every person from Gaza away. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=297.04s)]
*  Israel bombing Yemen, India bombing Pakistan, US bombing Yemen. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=305.36s)]
*  And of course, the war rages on between Russia and Ukraine with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine saying, look, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=310.16s)]
*  we're here for an unconditional ceasefire, but Russia just wants to exterminate us. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=319.36s)]
*  This is the quote no wars president. That's what Donald Trump claims he is. Also, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=324.88s)]
*  does it make you feel more comfortable to know that in Newark, the air traffic controllers are now on [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=330.24s)]
*  traumatic stress leave because of the firings that have taken place and the fact that these systems shut down [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  and the radars shut down and air traffic controllers. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  We're telling CNN [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=346.64s)]
*  do not fly into Newark. It is dangerous. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=348.64s)]
*  It is dangerous. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  And there were hours and hours of delays in Newark taking place. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  You've got the measles cases across the country. There's 935 reported cases, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=358.4s)]
*  but who the heck knows how many there really are because we're not getting any good data. Oh, by the way, this is the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQGl9FzqsE&t=365.03999999999996s)]
