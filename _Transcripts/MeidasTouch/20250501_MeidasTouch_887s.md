# Trump Suffers BIGGEST LOSS YET from…TRUMP JUDGE!!!
**MeidasTouch:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc)
*  Donald Trump just got a stunning rebuke from a Trump appointed judge, Judge Rodriguez in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=0.0s)]
*  Southern District of Texas. A Trump appointed judge has just barred the Trump regime from removing [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=7.2s)]
*  migrants under the Alien Enemies Act. Judge Rodriguez, who was appointed by Donald Trump [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=14.72s)]
*  in 2018, said the invocation of the Alien Enemies Act was basically patently unlawful and simply did [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=20.56s)]
*  not fit how Donald Trump was trying to use it based on a proclamation or via an executive order. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=28.64s)]
*  You know, we've been hearing, you know, Democrats talking about this as well over and over again. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=35.44s)]
*  Look, this shouldn't even be a political issue. This should just be a law and order due process [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=40.24s)]
*  issue. This is the United States of America. For example, Democratic Congress member Jason [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=46.56s)]
*  Crowe, a former Army Ranger, had put out the following statement as well. Donald Trump's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  first 100 days have meant chaos, recklessness and fear for too many families. They've shamefully [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=57.04s)]
*  deported U.S. citizens without due process. Ask yourself, what if your family, friend or neighbor [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=64.24s)]
*  is next? What if they are wrongfully imprisoned? We can't be silent. We here at the Midas Touch [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=70.48s)]
*  Network have Democratic Congress member Jason Crowe from Colorado's 6th Congressional District [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=77.2s)]
*  on the show and Congressman, your first time on the show. So let me just introduce you to the Midas [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=83.68s)]
*  Mighty. You represent Colorado's 6th, former Army Ranger. You're an attorney. You received the Bronze [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=88.56s)]
*  Star. You were an impeachment manager during the first Trump impeachment proceedings back during [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=94.4s)]
*  his first term. So I guess first, if you can respond to this order by the Trump appointed [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  judge, Judge Rodriguez in Texas saying the invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is unlawful [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=107.36000000000001s)]
*  and we'll get into some other topics, Congressman. Yeah, Ben, thanks for having me. Listen, first of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=112.24s)]
*  all, isn't it stunning to you that we are now in a moment where every time there's some judicial [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=117.44s)]
*  order or some judge pushing back on the Trump administration that it always has to be proceeded [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=123.6s)]
*  with, you know, a Trump appointed judge, an Obama appointed judge, a Biden appointed judge. You know, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=129.04s)]
*  just eight years ago, it wouldn't have mattered, right? Judges were judges. The judiciary was [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  independent. It had the competence of the American people. It just shows to extent to which [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=141.12s)]
*  erosion of competence in the judiciary that now it has to be viewed through a political lens. One of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=146.32s)]
*  the many institutions, I think, that has taken a hit under Donald Trump. But yes, I mean, this is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  a no-brainer. The president is trying to use the historic, you know, 100-plus-year-old authority, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=157.44s)]
*  a wartime authority, to justify his basic kidnappings of folks off the street, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=163.52s)]
*  rounding people up without due process. And I'm glad in this instance, a judge stood up and said, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=170.96s)]
*  enough is enough. I mean, as someone who's been in war, someone who's received the bronze medal, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=176.4s)]
*  it seems that Donald Trump invokes war so cavalierly. I mean, even whether it's the talk [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=182.56s)]
*  about annexation of Canada or Greenland, what that actually means, though, if it's taken to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=188.88s)]
*  its logical conclusion, is sending troops, young men and women of this country, to fight and die in [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=195.28s)]
*  wars against allies. And I don't think that registers when Trump uses language like that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=202.24s)]
*  How does that language hit you as a veteran? Well, you know, it hits me in a couple of different [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  ways. It hits me as a working-class person, somebody who grew up in a working-class family. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=214.64s)]
*  I started working when I was 15. I actually worked in fast food at Arby's growing up to help [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  support my family. And then I worked in construction to help put my way through [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  college. I enlisted. I became a private in the National Guard and then later went active duty [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=229.2s)]
*  and became a ranger. And what I learned growing up working, being around working-class folks, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=234.16s)]
*  is that when wealthy, pedigreed, elite folks like Donald Trump pound their chest and talk tough [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=239.84s)]
*  and talk about war, they're not talking about themselves. They're not the ones doing the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=249.04s)]
*  fighting. They're not the ones doing the sacrificing. They're talking about everybody else. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=253.68s)]
*  They're talking about people like me and the people that I grew up that have to go and do [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=258.0s)]
*  the tough work for them so that they can act tough and pound their chest. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=261.76s)]
*  Tell us about your general reaction to Trump's first 100 days in office. You've obviously talked [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  about how reckless and dangerous it is, but what's your overall response to it? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's an unmitigated disaster. There's just no other way to put it, right? Everything from the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=276.24s)]
*  world turning away from us, from America no longer being the national security and economic leader [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  of the free world, which by the way has very real economic consequences to the trade wars [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=287.12s)]
*  that this administration is starting, to the threats of massive and catastrophic [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  health care cuts. I have 115,000 folks in my district, in my community alone, that receive [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  Medicaid support. That's everything from drugs to treat diabetes that if you go a week without, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  could be a matter of life and death to people with sick children that don't know whether or not a [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=310.96s)]
*  month from now or two months from now they're going to be able to pay their bills. Of course, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=316.08s)]
*  this administration doing nothing to reduce the cost of anything. Actually, their trade wars are [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=319.84s)]
*  going to cost the average American family upwards of $5,000. They're imposing direct taxes on working [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=324.96s)]
*  Americans. So in every respect from illegal deportations and depriving due process to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=332.0s)]
*  destroying our alliances, to cutting health care, and of course, just the blatant corruption, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=339.91999999999996s)]
*  it's just been abhorrent. You were a leader in the army. You led troops. So leadership, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=345.44s)]
*  accountability, responsibility, a big deal. When Donald Trump tries to just blame everything [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=353.2s)]
*  on everybody else, just from a general leadership standpoint, I mean what Donald Trump said, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=361.04s)]
*  that the reason that the economy is contracting now and the market has been really what the worst [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=366.32s)]
*  since 1973 under Richard Nixon for the first 100 days, he goes, it's the Biden market. It's not me. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=371.6s)]
*  But then when Biden was leading, he said, it's the Trump market. I mean fundamentally, just as a [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=380.48s)]
*  leader, I mean what does that say to you? Yeah, it's everything. It's antithetical to everything [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=386.56s)]
*  I've ever known about leadership. From the very first day of boot camp, I started my career as a [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=392.88s)]
*  private. I ended my career in the military as a captain. I became an officer about halfway through. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=398.48s)]
*  In day one in the boot camp, you realize that you're taught, this is drilled into you day after day [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=405.04s)]
*  after day, is that the foundation of leadership is leadership by example. That it matters a lot [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=410.88s)]
*  less what you say than it does what you do, the example that you set. And that takes a couple of [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=416.32s)]
*  different forms. I became a paratrooper. So when we were in the plane, we're getting ready to jump [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=423.20000000000005s)]
*  out of the plane and parachute into an objective. What you learn is that the senior person in the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  plane jumps first. The commander jumps first. And then only then do your soldiers follow. And when [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=433.44s)]
*  you're out in the field and you get fresh hot food, which sometimes is a rarity, your soldiers eat [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=439.28s)]
*  first. And then if there's food left over, only then do you eat. So the idea is you take the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  sacrifices, you give the benefits to others. That's how you lead. That's what you're supposed to do. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=451.52s)]
*  That's servant leadership is what we call it. And of course, in this administration is the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=456.56s)]
*  total opposite. The higher up you go, the less accountability. The rules don't apply to you. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=461.44s)]
*  If you're Pete Hegseth, if you're the secretary of defense, the rules certainly don't apply [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=466.72s)]
*  to Donald Trump. And that's exactly the opposite message. And I'm worried about the corrosive [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=470.88s)]
*  impact that's going to have on the culture of our military. Talk to us about the corrosive impact. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=476.16s)]
*  Do you think that's already taking place based on Hegseth? We learned earlier that national security [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=482.08s)]
*  advisor Mike Walz is reportedly out. He's been fired. But talk to us about what you're seeing [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=488.96s)]
*  with Hegseth. Apparently at the DOD, they're there like polygraphing people, like on a daily basis, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=495.28s)]
*  hooking them up to polygraph tests. And he's spending his time focused on leaks and they're [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=501.84s)]
*  having these signal chats. What do you make of it all? Yeah, I mean, there's so many ways of looking [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=506.56s)]
*  at this. You look at the direct risk to our service members right now, the fact that they're [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=511.04s)]
*  putting military operational information, classified sensitive operation about military [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=515.2s)]
*  operations that are about to happen on unsecured signal chat streams that our adversaries penetrate [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  and try to intercept all the time. I mean, direct risk to our soldiers. We talk about the lack of [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  accountability, the message that for the higher ups, accountability doesn't matter. You have [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  different standards, that message that that sends to privates, the sergeants, to your captains, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=538.64s)]
*  the corrosive impact on the culture, and of course our allies, right? I always say I went to war three [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=543.92s)]
*  times for this country, once to Iraq, twice to Afghanistan. And every single time I did that, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=549.92s)]
*  I worked with our allies. The United States was not going it alone. I sat there shoulder to shoulder [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  fighting with our NATO partners. And right now we have pushed those partners and our friends away [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=562.8s)]
*  from us. The United States is strong and secure, not just because we have aircraft carriers and we [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=568.8s)]
*  have fighters and bombers. We're the strongest when we have friends and we have alliances. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=573.8399999999999s)]
*  And we are rapidly eroding all of those, making us far less safe. I think about the first Trump [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=579.92s)]
*  impeachment where you were an impeachment manager and Donald Trump shaking down Ukraine for [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=586.88s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars in military weapons to launch investigations against his [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=594.32s)]
*  political rival. And I think about what Trump is doing now in plain view. I mean, even in my view, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=599.28s)]
*  shaking down Ukraine for minerals deals while they're at their most vulnerable and doing it [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=607.04s)]
*  in plain sight and acting like it's a legitimate deal. Also, just the corruption you see on a daily [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=612.72s)]
*  basis over the weekend, Donald Trump Jr. and the crypto czar, Sachs, announcing that they were doing [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=620.32s)]
*  this executive branch club $500,000 for, I guess, access to them. And they announced it at the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=628.08s)]
*  Willard Hotel in D.C. An announcement of in Qatar, a Trump resort's going to be built there, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=635.68s)]
*  a new one, we learned today. A fund backed by Abu Dhabi will be making a $2 billion business deal [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=643.04s)]
*  using digital coins from Trump's family cryptocurrency venture. So in terms of Trump's 90 deals in 90 days [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=649.28s)]
*  for the country based on this reckless trade war, we've had zero deals so far in 90 days. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=656.56s)]
*  But these personal deals and personal wealth is amassing. What do we do about it? What do you make [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=662.08s)]
*  of it? What happens? Yeah, I mean, it almost makes me physically ill when you review this list of [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=667.5200000000001s)]
*  blatant corruption. I think one of our most important jobs right now, you know, regardless [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=674.24s)]
*  of your political affiliation, if you're a Democrat, if you're an independent, if you're, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=680.0s)]
*  you know, a logical, rational Republican, or if you're just somebody who, you know, just wants to [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=684.08s)]
*  live their life and have government work for them, I think one of our most important jobs [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=689.28s)]
*  is to not stop calling any of this out, to not allow this to become normal and okay, this blatant [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=693.6s)]
*  corruption, because that's what he wants, right? This is the whole flooding the zone thing that [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=701.12s)]
*  they're going to just send so much out there and hit us with so many different things that we're [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=705.36s)]
*  just going to stop responding, we're going to lay back and everyone's going to give up, you know, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=709.6s)]
*  and the apathy and the disenchantment with our system will take over and people will disengage. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=714.0s)]
*  That's how democracies die, right? So we can't stop fighting. We have to hit on everything. We [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=719.28s)]
*  got to call it all out. We have to go everywhere and make our case to everybody all the time. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=724.56s)]
*  And that's going to take energy. That's going to take fire. And that's going to take, you know, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  people who are committed to this democracy in this country who want to fight for it, standing up [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=733.8399999999999s)]
*  constantly in every venue, you know, at Rotary Club meetings, at school board meetings, at [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=738.64s)]
*  neighborhood picnics and having the tough conversations. Finally, Congressman, I asked [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=744.48s)]
*  this somewhat open-ended question when I do interviews like this, because with someone like [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=750.08s)]
*  you who sees a lot of things that we don't see here, are there any issues that you think are not [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  getting enough attention out there just generally that you're focused on that you think our audience [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=759.6s)]
*  should know about? Yeah, I mean, there's a lot and I know we don't have the time to run through all [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=765.76s)]
*  of them. But I think one of the things is as somebody who has spent my life in defense of this [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=771.12s)]
*  country that started my career in public service in uniform, I spend a lot of time making sure that [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=775.52s)]
*  our veterans, that our service members are protected. And, you know, listen, I went to war [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=781.44s)]
*  three times in wars that did not end well. We spent trillions of dollars in decades and squandered [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=786.16s)]
*  opportunity and lost lives. And these wars went off the rails a long time ago, right? So what I [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=793.2s)]
*  really am trying to focus a lot on is reasserting congressional authority, taking congressional [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=801.6800000000001s)]
*  responsibility back, right? Which is what the Republicans are doing the opposite of right now. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=808.24s)]
*  They are, they're ceding territory, they're giving up their congressional authority and their [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=813.12s)]
*  responsibilities to this administration. It's time that Congress take its power back on issues of [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=818.0s)]
*  war power, on issues of immigration, on issues of terrorists in the economy. We have to reestablish [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=823.92s)]
*  the balance, the constitutional balance between the executive branch and the Congress because it's [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=829.8399999999999s)]
*  the House of Representatives, it's the Congress that's supposed to be the most accountable, that [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=835.28s)]
*  stands for election most frequently, that every weekend we go back to our districts and we are [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=839.28s)]
*  supposed to hold town halls. We engage with folks and we have to look people in the eye and tell [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=845.28s)]
*  them what we're doing and what we're voting on that week. And it's time to restore that balance. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5OetSidmc&t=851.4399999999999s)]
