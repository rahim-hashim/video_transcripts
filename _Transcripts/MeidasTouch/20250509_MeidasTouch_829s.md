# PANICKED White House SNAPS in DISASTER Press Briefing
**MeidasTouch:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA)
*  Donald Trump's chief propagandist, his press secretary, Caroline Levitt, just snapped during [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=0.0s)]
*  a disastrous press conference when she was asked about Donald Trump traveling to the Middle East [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=6.08s)]
*  and meeting with many of the countries and sovereign wealth funds that he has personal [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=11.92s)]
*  business interests with who have enriched him to the tune of about $4 billion. Here play this clip. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=16.88s)]
*  You noted he is a successful businessman. Do you know if the president has any plans to meet with [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=23.84s)]
*  any of the folks involved with any of the family businesses over there or see any of the sites that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=28.64s)]
*  are going to be neutral? Not to my knowledge and let me just get to the premise of your question [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=33.36s)]
*  that both of you have raised. I think it's frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=38.08s)]
*  suggest that President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit. He left a life of luxury and a [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=42.16s)]
*  life of running a very successful real estate empire for public service not just once but twice. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=48.08s)]
*  And again the American public re-elected him back to this White House because they trust he acts in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=54.72s)]
*  the best interests of our country and putting the American public first. This is a president who has [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=58.88s)]
*  actually lost money for being president of the United States. I don't remember these same type [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=63.2s)]
*  of questions being asked of my predecessor about a career politician who was clearly profiting off [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=67.28s)]
*  of this office. That is not what President Trump does and this White House holds ourselves to the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=72.64s)]
*  highest of ethical standards. Oh yes, Caroline Levitt, it would be ridiculous for anybody in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=76.72s)]
*  the room to dare question Donald Trump's motivations or we could come with receipts, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=82.8s)]
*  Caroline. Like I don't know, Donald Trump doing a deal with Qatar for a Trump resort there, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=88.24s)]
*  Donald Trump doing a deal with Saudi Arabia for a resort in Oman, the Abu Dhabi fund using [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=92.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's crypto for two billion dollars worth of purchases. I could go on but I think [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=98.8s)]
*  we all get the point. Then Caroline Levitt, Donald Trump's chief propagandist attacks the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=103.84s)]
*  librarian of Congress who Donald Trump unlawfully fired and basically says that she was woke in DEI [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=109.44s)]
*  and that's why she had to go and be fired even though Donald Trump doesn't have the authority [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=117.28s)]
*  to unilaterally fire the librarian of Congress. Here play this clip. Question, the president [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=121.84s)]
*  fired the librarian of Congress, why did he choose to do that? We felt she did not fit the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=126.32s)]
*  means of the American people. There were quite concerning things that she had done at the library [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=130.56s)]
*  of Congress in the pursuit of DEI and putting inappropriate books in the library for children [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=134.96s)]
*  and we don't believe that she was serving the interests of the American taxpayer well so she [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=140.72s)]
*  has been removed from her position and the president is well within his rights to do that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=144.88s)]
*  And by the way it should be noted that Dr. Carla Hayden, who's the 14th librarian of Congress, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  was Senate confirmed in 2016 during Donald Trump's first administration. She's the first female [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=154.8s)]
*  librarian of Congress, she's the first African American librarian of Congress, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=160.96s)]
*  and she's the first actual librarian of Congress. But for Donald Trump, anyone who supports education, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=165.52s)]
*  anybody who supports diversity, that makes you woke and you've got to go. Next up the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=174.24s)]
*  Bulwark reporter who's in the Oval Office asks a question about Donald Trump continuing to post [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=181.36s)]
*  about meme coins and do you think that's a conflict of interest? Here's what Donald [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=187.12s)]
*  Trump's chief propagandist Caroline Levitt says about that. Let's play the clip. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=191.84s)]
*  The president is a successful businessman and I think frankly it's one of the many reasons that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=217.12s)]
*  people re-elected him back to this office. There are at least some people who are buying this coin [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=221.36s)]
*  who seem to view it as an opportunity that influenced the president's views. There was [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=225.12s)]
*  a logistics company this week that said they would buy 20 million dollars in the coin in order to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=228.16s)]
*  advocate for free trade between the U.S. and Mexico. If buyers are buying for that reason are they [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  wasting their money? Look I can assure you the president acts with only the interests of the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=236.8s)]
*  American public in mind, putting our country first and doing what's best for our country [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=240.96s)]
*  full stop. That's his intention and that's what he's focused on. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=245.28s)]
*  Oh so you just think that's normal Caroline that Donald Trump makes posts that if you have the 22 [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=248.88s)]
*  largest crypto wallets filled with the Trump meme coin you get to personally meet with Donald Trump. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=256.72s)]
*  You don't find it abnormal that Donald Trump runs pump and dump like schemes. At least that's my [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=264.64s)]
*  opinion of what it appears to be. Which by the way is what he's doing with our economy as well. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=271.92s)]
*  We're supposed to normalize United States presidents selling freaking meme coins and access [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  from the Oval Office while y'all were ranting about whatever you were upset about with Hunter [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=283.12s)]
*  Biden. I mean seriously that's what we're that's that's where we're at with this. Oh and by the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=288.0s)]
*  way just a stat for you on the Trump meme coins there were only 55 crypto wallets or like people [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=294.16s)]
*  who actually made money from Trump's meme coin while there was 747,000 who lost money who got [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=300.96s)]
*  the rug pulled from this Ponzi scheme perpetual perennial fraudster presidency. The next time [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=307.76s)]
*  the next question a reporter asked Caroline Levitt about the Trump regime dismantling the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=315.52s)]
*  Consumer Product Safety Commission play this clip. Caroline yesterday the administration appears to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=321.28s)]
*  have started dismantling the Consumer Product Safety Commission. This is the federal agency [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=328.0s)]
*  an independent one that does recalls and is responsible for product safety. Does the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=333.28s)]
*  administration not believe that it's important you know to keep toys and cribs I mean you're [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=338.08s)]
*  a young mom off of the product of the market. It's a federal agency within which branch. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=343.84s)]
*  It's the executive branch. Who's the head of the executive branch? The president of the United [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=351.2s)]
*  States. He has the right to fire people within the executive branch. It's a pretty simple answer. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=355.12s)]
*  Francesca. Suppose we wrote on the Midas Touch Network oh dismantling the agency that coordinates [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=360.88s)]
*  recalls. What could possibly go wrong with that? I don't know. I don't know. Ridiculous. Okay next. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=366.56s)]
*  Then we have here next clip we have a reporter asking Caroline Levitt about so does Donald Trump [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=374.88s)]
*  intend to have a 10% baseline tariff no matter what on the United Kingdom because Trump announced [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=383.36s)]
*  some like fake trade deal with the UK. So is it a is there always going to be 10% or and then Caroline [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=389.76s)]
*  Levitt responds oh it's going to be 10% no matter what every country in the world will get tariff 10% [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  is what Donald Trump intends to do but obviously we know when Trump says he intends to do something [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=404.48s)]
*  he doesn't really do it here play this clip. I mean that the 10% baseline is going to still be [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=408.88s)]
*  there at the end when all of the other details are ironed out. The president is committed to the 10% [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=414.24s)]
*  baseline tariff not just for the United Kingdom but for his trade negotiations with all other [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=419.36s)]
*  countries as well. Permanently even after the deals are done like that is going to remain. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=423.52s)]
*  The president is determined to continue with that 10% baseline tariff I just spoke to him about it [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  earlier. So I'm really looking forward to Mother's Day this year it's going to be a very special day [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=432.64s)]

*  going to be like Donald Trump like randomly posted I like 80% remember Donald Trump said [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=549.2s)]
*  I'd like the number 80% for tariffs with China I mean as Donald Trump toys with and tries to [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=555.44s)]
*  manipulate the market although he didn't do a great job manipulating the market on Friday although [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=561.28s)]
*  before he did I just think that people like what's really going on here is there going to be a deal [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=565.6s)]
*  that's going to happen with China and by a deal basically you as the arsonist putting somewhat [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=570.96s)]
*  out your fire and just watch what's said right here by chief propagandist Caroline Levitt let's [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=579.0400000000001s)]
*  play this clip great yeah thanks Caroline the president has been pretty firm on keeping these [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=583.2s)]
*  145 percent tariffs in place on Chinese imports today via truth social he said that he'd be [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=587.9200000000001s)]
*  possibly open to lowering those to 80 percent why the change and how did the president land on 80 [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=593.76s)]
*  the president still remains with his position that he is not going to unilaterally bring down [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=599.12s)]
*  tariffs on China we need to see concessions from them as well and again that's part of the reason [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=604.08s)]
*  that secretary besant is going to talk to his Chinese counterparts this weekend to start those [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=608.4s)]
*  discussions in person as for the 80 number that was a number the president threw out there and [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=613.6s)]
*  we'll see what happens this weekend and always in the effort of transparency I'm sure you'll [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=618.72s)]
*  hear directly from the treasury secretary or the president after those negotiations conclude so [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=622.5600000000001s)]
*  again leaders need to speak with clarity leaders need to speak with precision right what are y'all [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=628.48s)]
*  even talking about here um they're the way they toy with people's lives you know small businesses [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=636.16s)]
*  are getting medium-sized all businesses but especially those that can't just call up the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=646.64s)]
*  white house and do quid pro quos for favors are getting screwed so when you see stuff like this [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=652.32s)]
*  and you don't provide clarity or what the plan is donald trump just sends a post in the morning [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=659.2s)]
*  it's like oh that's where we're going this time it's it's absurd it's dangerous and it has real [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTlw4rHcNVA&t=665.2800000000001s)]
