*  Encouraging an environment of hate and divisiveness [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=140.0s)]
*  Thank you so much [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=142.89999999999998s)]
*  This committee could be engaged in actual oversight of fraud waste abuse and mismanagement [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=144.89999999999998s)]
*  So let's talk about waste like Trump's plan to spend almost a hundred million dollars for his little birthday parade [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=150.14s)]
*  Or how he spent 25% of his first a hundred days golfing costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=156.14s)]
*  In fact, it's a little bit over 30 million at our last estimation [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=163.7s)]
*  In fact [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=168.02s)]

*  Golfing yet. The Republicans have been silent [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  So they must think spending taxpayer dollars on the president's golfing trips is more important than providing health care to their constituents [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=177.86s)]
*  And when I talk about constituents, we don't talk about the ones on this committee [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=185.10000000000002s)]
*  And then over here more Marjorie Taylor green yelling at Democratic Congress members and saying you you're taking my time [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=188.38s)]

*  Both the Democrats and Republicans and then we rebalanced them so that we each have equal time. That's that's pretty basic [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=275.5s)]
*  Well, we will we will consider that. Thank you [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=281.94s)]

*  Thank you, madam chair [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=302.9s)]
*  Let me tell you what I'm here for [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=304.9s)]
*  Now there was one moment as well and this just shows you how deceitful these mago Republicans are so one of the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=308.09999999999997s)]
*  People who were subpoenaed to show up is a guy named Damien LaFelt and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=316.58s)]
*  He's the chairman of the board of USA fencing now you may say [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=322.7s)]
*  Now you may say [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=327.1s)]
*  USA fencing, but what the hell are they even doing here? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=328.62s)]
*  Well, one of the state regime media Fox things that they were pushing was like two years ago or something that there was a [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=331.14s)]
*  Transgender fencing person and that the transgender fencing person was this major scandal. So this was on Fox all of the time [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=338.86s)]
*  so as a result of Fox basically doxing this chairman of USA fencing because there was a [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=346.42s)]
*  one [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=354.58s)]
*  Transgender fencing person and I don't think it was even recently [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=355.94s)]
*  This guy got death threats LaFelt got death threats over and over again the head of USA fencing [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=359.42s)]
*  So they subpoena him to try to attack him and then they try to defame him [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=365.46s)]
*  So the mega Republicans show a photo of him that makes it look like he's giving the camera the middle finger [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=369.58s)]
*  But they manipulate the image where if you actually look at what the image is [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=376.7s)]
*  You'll see that he was showing two fingers but they chop it off so it looks like he's giving the middle finger [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=381.34s)]
*  This is how deceitful and devious these mega Republicans are play this clip [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=387.4s)]
*  Now one big fight Martha has been over a picture of the chairman [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=391.62s)]
*  Chairman Marjorie Taylor Greene actually brought it up during the hearing and Democrats said this was a big [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=396.38s)]
*  misrepresentation watch this [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=402.86s)]
*  Mr. LaFelt came in here today [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=405.94s)]
*  Saying that this is game day [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=408.65999999999997s)]

*  Use subpoena power folks [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=423.3s)]
*  I'm sure you hear me talk a lot about my family here on the Midas touch network and in order to give me the peace [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=425.18s)]

*  hearings and they would literally edit the text messages like they'd [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=544.62s)]
*  Manipulate the words and then I think it was yeah, it was Congresswoman AOC who said I have the real texts [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=549.3s)]

*  Mr. LaFell USA fencing doesn't receive large taxpayer funded grants and doesn't really receive [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=584.82s)]
*  Federal funding is that correct? Sir, we do not receive a penny in federal funding [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=591.7s)]
*  So you don't receive a penny of federal funding and we're spending our time in the government efficiency committee [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=595.5400000000001s)]
*  Debating a fencing tournament and your association that of you which receive no federal dollars [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=601.74s)]
*  So what the hell is this government efficiency doing? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=607.62s)]
*  They're spending their time going after USA fencing, which is not subsidized by the federal government at all [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=610.26s)]
*  This is what they're spending our taxpayer money on [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=616.02s)]
*  While you are suffering while while people are living paycheck to paycheck while mortgage rates are close to 7% [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=619.66s)]

*  Or whatever the hell they're talking about. This is what they're focused on [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=648.98s)]
*  Democratic Congressmember Garcia had an important point to make here as well. Let's play this clip people are aware [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=653.58s)]
*  There is some bipartisan consensus [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=659.34s)]
*  Here's a quote from one of my Republican colleagues who's actually on this committee today, which I want to read [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=661.9s)]

*  LGBTQ rights and equality no one should be discriminated against I have friends and family that identify as LGBTQ [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=670.58s)]
*  Understanding how they feel and how they've been treated is important [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=678.54s)]
*  Having been around gay lesbian and transgender people has informed my opinion over my lifetime [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=682.46s)]
*  Now miss Goss Graves, do you know who said this by any chance? I [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=689.98s)]
*  Don't know. This was actually Congresswoman Nancy Mace who's I know waved on to our committee today now, madam chair [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=695.22s)]
*  I'd like to insert into the record this article on CNN that says a title Nancy Mace now targeting transgender lawmaker [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=700.7s)]
*  Calls herself pro-transgender rights in 2023 madam chairwoman [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=708.58s)]

*  Thank you. I point this out because it's actually important context [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=748.64s)]
*  Republicans accused Democrats of focusing too much on LGBTQ plus issues or trans issues [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=752.4799999999999s)]
*  But we want to talk about protecting Social Security [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=758.2399999999999s)]
*  We want to talk about protecting the cost of living we want to talk about lowering prices [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=760.5999999999999s)]
*  We want to make sure that all people have health care [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=764.92s)]
*  But Republicans are so obsessed with demonizing trans people that we are wasting time in our government efficiency committee [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=767.6s)]
*  Talking about trans people that like fencing [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=775.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=778.0s)]
*  He showed the words of Nancy Mace because once upon a time when she was pretending [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=778.16s)]
*  To be a centrist in her district in South Carolina before it was gerrymandered [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=783.36s)]
*  To be one of the most extreme Magga Republican districts [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=789.2s)]
*  Nancy Mace was saying oh, I'm for the LGBTQ community. Of course I am now she posts what what he say [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=793.24s)]
*  347 times in a day [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=800.0400000000001s)]
*  Anti trans anti LGBTQ stuff and here she is post like this is weird behavior [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=802.9200000000001s)]
*  Set aside politics. This is weird human behavior [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=809.4s)]
*  This is not how people behave and she goes spotted in Austin all gender restroom on a recent trip to Texas [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=813.48s)]
*  Um, no, there are only two hold the line biology isn't bigotry. This is what she does. She posts this crap over and over again [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=821.24s)]
*  She got community noted. This is a single occupancy [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=829.4s)]
*  Ambulant toilet, which is a lockable door. These are also known as disabled toilets [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=833.22s)]
*  What are you taking pictures of and posting yourself on this? Why are you bullying transgender people? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=838.6s)]
*  Why are you bullying gay people? What go spend your time doing something else like maybe actually making trade deals? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=843.88s)]
*  Or or making the economy work for everyone. Maybe just focus your freaking time on dealing with housing [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=851.16s)]
*  So that people don't have to work multiple jobs to live paycheck to paycheck [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=857.64s)]
*  But if they work one job [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=862.28s)]
*  They can get paid with dignity and they can afford a house and they can afford their mortgage and they don't have to worry [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=863.88s)]
*  About living paycheck to pay why don't you guys focus on those issues? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=869.56s)]
*  And then maybe once you get through the basics if you want to start talking about USA fencing [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=873.24s)]
*  Let's let's go through a bunch of other issues first. Shall we right there? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=878.28s)]
*  Here's congressmember cassara. Let's play this clip [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=882.12s)]
*  so, of course republicans on the government efficiency committee are holding an emergency hearing [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=885.16s)]

*  Not fences like the kind that goes around a building but like the sport with the sorts [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=895.4s)]
*  And i've knocked on thousands of doors and talked to thousands of republican independent and democratic voters [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=901.56s)]
*  In my career and not a single time has someone flung open their door and said thank god you're here congressman [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=908.28s)]
*  I want to ask you about [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=915.3199999999999s)]
*  Transgender people fencing. It's just never happened. I've never even met a fencer before i've just seen it on the parent trap [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=918.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm sure it's a great sport. But what the hell are we doing here? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=926.68s)]
*  seriously [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=931.4599999999999s)]
*  We're here because chairwoman marjorie taylor green [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=932.92s)]
*  Thinks that if she picks on vulnerable people like trans folks [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=936.68s)]
*  She can avoid having a discussion about the allegations of insider trading against her [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=940.8399999999999s)]
*  She thinks that she can distract from the fact that trump and mago republicans are raising your costs every single day [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=946.4399999999999s)]
*  Suppressing your wages every single day stealing your taxpayer dollars every single day and threatening your health care [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=953.62s)]
*  That's the reason we're at this crazy hearing today [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=960.4399999999999s)]

*  Let's play this clip right here this interview over the weekend that he doesn't know [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=1136.68s)]
*  uh if [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=1140.92s)]
*  He would uphold should uphold the constitution in in the situation with due process [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=1141.96s)]
*  with undocumented immigrants [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=1148.76s)]
*  What's your reaction with the president said this morning? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=1151.96s)]
*  Look, I think this is so misguided the notion that [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=1155.4s)]
*  Because he won an election that he should be able to ignore the constitution or violate our laws is preposterous [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=1159.72s)]
*  Every president wins an election [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=1167.96s)]
*  That does not mean that they get to just make up whatever laws they want and decide which ones they're going to comply with [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=1169.4s)]
*  In which ones they aren't [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=1175.8799999999999s)]
*  Donald trump does not get to decide what the law is the supreme court and the judiciary does [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=1177.56s)]
*  As well as immigration judges for deportation cases [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=1184.04s)]
*  And so the issue here is he wants to use the alien enemies act in 1798 [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqk9qL7FI6s&t=1187.8s)]
