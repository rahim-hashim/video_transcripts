# Trump LOSES CONTROL as he gets VERY BAD NEWS
**MeidasTouch:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0)
*  Complete and utter weakness, complete and utter lunacy, the Trump regime is an utter mess. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=0.0s)]
*  As protests continue today, the 50-51 protests spreading once again across the nation. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=8.8s)]
*  Donald Trump began yesterday by posting memes and posting altered images of the New York Times cover [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=17.2s)]
*  that talks about Abrego Garcia and Donald Trump's like, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=25.92s)]
*  we're never going to return him despite a nine to zero ruling from the Supreme Court [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  saying facilitate the return of the migrant who you kidnapped and threw in an extermination camp [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=36.08s)]
*  in El Salvador without due process. And as the day progressed, Donald Trump continued to try to project [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=41.36s)]
*  the image of a strongman because he knows deep down inside how weak he is and how the whole [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  world views him as a pathetic fool. Donald Trump posted this yesterday. It's an interview of him [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=55.36s)]
*  on Fox and this is Trump's recap of it. Trump on Fox, we didn't need legislation, we need a president. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=62.88s)]
*  In other words, what he's saying is we don't need due process, we need a dictator. We don't need laws, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=71.84s)]
*  we need a dictator. If you look at this and you're okay with him posting this, then let's just face it, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=78.88s)]
*  you hate America, you don't like democracy, you don't like law and order, you don't like our system, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=86.8s)]
*  perhaps you'd like to live in Russia. More on that in a moment. And as the day winded down yesterday, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=93.44s)]
*  Donald Trump started posting torture videos, ISIS style torture videos of Americans handing off [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=100.88s)]
*  migrants to the government of El Salvador to be tortured in extermination camps and Trump posted [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=111.44s)]
*  video after video of that. Again, Donald Trump giving the middle finger to the federal courts [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=118.64s)]
*  and to the United States Supreme Court. But Donald, you're not fooling people. If you want to take a [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=125.52s)]
*  look at the latest Atlas Intel poll, they were one of the, if not the best pollster in 2024. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  On all of the issues, Donald Trump's underwater in the Atlas Intel poll, meaning Americans disapprove [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=138.72s)]
*  of him. On immigration, negative six. And as you start asking questions, not just about deportation [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=145.6s)]
*  and strong borders in general, which most people support as an abstract theory, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  but taking people without due process, sending them to prisons or concentration camps in other [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=158.8s)]
*  countries, those are not favored at all by wide margins by the American people. But Trump's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=164.08s)]
*  negative six on immigration, negative 14 on the economy, negative 12 on democracy, negative 17 on [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  healthcare, negative eight when it comes to dealing with China. China is just making a total [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=177.44s)]
*  buffoon of Donald Trump, but that's not that hard because that's who Donald Trump is. Remember, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=184.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's promises though, said I would talk about Russia on day one, that there would be peace [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  in Ukraine in 24 hours. He said it would be so easy that he knows Zelensky and he knows Putin and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=194.96s)]
*  it would be very easy to bring peace to Ukraine in 24 hours. Well, yesterday we learned a few things. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=201.04s)]
*  First, the US basically proposed a plan that gives all of the territory that Russia's taken [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=207.12s)]
*  over in Ukraine to Russia, a total capitulation would be part of Donald Trump's plan and to have [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=213.6s)]
*  the United States recognize Crimea as being part of Russia. In other word, rewarding Russia [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=220.72s)]
*  for its genocide of Ukrainians and its unlawful invasion. We knew that was Trump's plan all along [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  and Trump quickly lost patience in the negotiation. In fact, he and Marco Rubio said, look, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=236.32000000000002s)]
*  if the parties don't accept this, we're done. We're done with this. We're not going to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=242.72s)]
*  stick around to do peace. It's too challenging. It's too difficult to do. I thought, Donald, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=247.12s)]
*  it was going to be easy. Yesterday, Donald Trump looked like Big Bird in the Oval Office, this big [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=253.44s)]
*  yellow tie. Donald Trump speaking about peace negotiations and let me show you what he said. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=259.04s)]
*  Play this clip. Being killed in battle. It's a vicious battle with the best equipment, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  the best everything, and it is brutal. Two thousand five hundred young people a week, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  some of them not so young, actually. They're getting older. They're getting older by the month, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=276.24s)]
*  but two thousand five hundred a week and we're going to get it stopped. Ideally now, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  if for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're just going to say, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=286.24s)]
*  you're foolish, you're fools, you're horrible people, and we're going to just take a pass, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=292.56s)]
*  but hopefully we won't have to do that. And Marco is right in saying it. We're getting, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=297.44s)]
*  we want to see it end. Think of it. So at the Midas Touch Network, we made this video [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=302.88s)]
*  of Trump's promises versus what Trump and his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, are saying right [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  now. Here play this clip. End the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. Yes. How would you do that? I know [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=314.56s)]
*  Zelensky very well. I'll end that war between those two countries in 24 hours. It won't even [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=321.04s)]
*  take that long. No one's saying it's going to be done in 12 hours, but we want to see how far apart [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=328.16s)]
*  it is and whether those differences are can even be narrow. So we came here yesterday to sort of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=333.2s)]
*  begin to talk about more specific outlines of what it might take to end the war, to try to figure out [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=339.76000000000005s)]
*  very soon. And I'm talking about a matter of days, not a matter of weeks, whether or not this is the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=345.6s)]
*  war that can be ended. If for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=350.24s)]
*  we're just going to say, you're foolish, you're fools, you're horrible people, and we're going [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=356.88s)]
*  to just take a pass. When you go into the cross tabs of some of these polls that show Donald [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=361.44s)]
*  Trump's approval plummeting to levels that are lower than his first term and you poll certain [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=367.04s)]
*  groups, in month three of the second term, Trump's average approval rating is under 40% among the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=375.04s)]
*  following groups. Among black people, 23%. Among people ages 18 to 29, his approval is 34%. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=381.68s)]
*  Independence, 37%. Moderates, 37%. Women, 39%. Latinos, 39%. And so what's Donald Trump doing as [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=388.64000000000004s)]
*  all of the data is bad, as it's obvious that his trade war is causing not just a recession, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=398.08000000000004s)]
*  but a great recession or even something worse? What Donald Trump said he did in the first term, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=404.88s)]
*  you got to stop the testing, stop the data. ProPublica did a great report. I'll do a video [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=411.04s)]
*  today that goes into more detail about it. I'm going to interview Congress member Pappas about [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=416.64s)]
*  it as well. Donald Trump halts data collection on drug use, maternal mortality, climate change, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=422.08s)]
*  and more. Donald Trump's basically in gutting these agencies. By the way, federal spending's up. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  Just want to give you the objective data. There's more federal spending now under Trump than there [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=438.0s)]
*  was under former President Biden. Also, salaries for federal workers up right now more than it was [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=442.56s)]
*  under former President Biden. It was never about cutting government waste. It was about stealing [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=449.04s)]
*  your data. It was about stealing your social security information, getting your medical records, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=453.2s)]
*  getting all of the sensitive information, tax information for the Trump regime to hoard and [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=457.92s)]
*  to use against people. That's what this was about. Because if it was actually about government [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  efficiency, the exact opposite took place. Let me be very clear about that. So a deadly E. coli [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=468.0s)]
*  outbreak hit 15 states, but the FDA chose not to report it. Donald Trump now claims that egg prices [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=475.52s)]
*  are way down. At yesterday's press conference, Donald Trump said that the big issue with eggs [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=483.6s)]
*  right now is that they're too cheap. And so many people have too many eggs. You don't know what to [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=490.4s)]
*  do with all of your eggs because you have so many eggs. And of course it's a lie, but there is this [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=496.08s)]
*  complete detachment from reality. This is what fascist authoritarian regimes do. Here, play this [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=501.76s)]
*  clip of Donald Trump saying eggs and everything is so, so cheap right now. Here, play this clip. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  And the egg prices are down 87 percent, but nobody talks about that. You can have all the eggs you [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=513.28s)]
*  want. We have too many eggs. In fact, if anything, the prices are getting too low. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=521.04s)]
*  So I just want to let you know prices are down. Because what's really going on right now, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  as Barron's reports, there's a global rebalancing underway as investors continue to sell off U.S. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=531.36s)]
*  bonds. Yes, there'll be up days in the market, down days in the market, but the trend is now down. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=538.64s)]
*  And unfortunately, it's a trend that is, seems to be here to stay persistently. From this article, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=544.24s)]
*  it explains, the rest of the world has crossed a red line and they will try to reduce dependence [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=550.16s)]
*  on the U.S. on trade, on defense, on everything. There just ain't going back. The U.S. is viewed [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=556.24s)]
*  as unreliable, capricious, arbitrary, vindictive fascist under the Trump regime. It's going to take [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=563.4399999999999s)]
*  a lot of rebuilding, folks. And what does Donald Trump do? He aligns himself with people like Naib [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=570.7199999999999s)]
*  Bukele. That's who Donald Trump worships or looks up to. Thirty-five billion dollar GDP in El Salvador. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=577.76s)]
*  Trump loves Viktor Orban of hungry, huge inflation, failed state, essentially. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=585.52s)]
*  Donald Trump loves Javier Malé of Argentina, massive poverty. He likes North Korea, Kim Jong-un. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=592.48s)]
*  He looks up to failed dictators. And so perhaps the least surprising news of this all, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=600.8s)]
*  though Alex Eisenstadt, I think he's a good writer. He got the scoop. Scoop. Trump revamps Schedule F, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=607.36s)]
*  making it easier to cut federal workers. And it talks about how, this is what we talked about, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=613.76s)]
*  right, with Project 2025. They were going to re-characterize the workers so that they're all [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=619.12s)]
*  at-will employees. That's what Schedule F is. But look, while that is serious, at this point, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=624.48s)]
*  Trump's gutted the federal government. I mean, he's fired so many people. He's destroyed the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=629.92s)]
*  ability of agencies to function, from the National Oceanic Institute's work to the Forest Services, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=634.8000000000001s)]
*  to NIH and CDC. You've got RFK Jr. giving these speeches and saying the most horrific things about [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=644.24s)]
*  autistic people and saying that people who are older don't have autism and it's only in younger [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=654.4s)]
*  people and just spreading all of these medical lies and disinformation. It is a cacostocracy, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=659.84s)]
*  which means a regime staffed by the worst of the worst. That's what it is now. But folks, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=667.52s)]
*  I do feel hope within all of this. I feel hope when I see senators like Van Hollen going and [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lC3XewF1g0&t=672.72s)]
