# Trump TRADE WAR BACKFIRES as China CHECKMATES HIM
**MeidasTouch:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg)
*  China is putting on a clinic right now in standing up against Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=0.0s)]
*  They are checkmating him over and over again and humiliating him in public. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=5.62s)]
*  They've got a multi-prong strategy to checkmate him on the retaliatory tariff side. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=12.08s)]
*  China's raised their retaliatory tariffs to 125%, effectively shutting down the China's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=18.84s)]
*  market from United States goods and products. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=26.26s)]
*  So that's step one. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=29.66s)]
*  Then on the public relations side of things, they are just continuing to mock the United [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=31.42s)]
*  States with memes and on social media. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=37.92s)]
*  They're putting out this AI footage of American, overweight Americans in factories putting [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=41.660000000000004s)]
*  together iPhones as the Trump regime says that he wants Americans to start building [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  and assembling iPhones and things like that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=54.36s)]
*  And then on the diplomatic side of things, China's been reaching out to former allies [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=57.28s)]
*  of America and they've been building relations there, trying to open free trade agreements, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=62.72s)]
*  for example, with Europe. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  The China electric vehicle manufacturer BYD, for example, we've seen their shares, their [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  stock surge and China's BYD now gaining a foothold in Europe, which used to be kind [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=79.0s)]
*  of the home where Teslas would thrive. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=86.94s)]
*  See you later, Tesla's people are not buying those. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=89.34s)]
*  BYD, a car that many people actually say is superior, but had previously been prevented [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=92.64s)]
*  based on regulatory machinations in Europe and the United States from getting into other [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=99.4s)]
*  markets. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=106.12s)]
*  China has been doing this, I think, in a very smart and sophisticated way. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=107.12s)]
*  You have Xi Jinping kind of inspired by Sun Tzu's The Art of War, Donald Trump, The Art [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  of the Deal, which he didn't even write, which we know from Donald Trump's past is bankrupting [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  essentially everything that he touches. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=123.28s)]
*  So let's just go through this one by one methodically and let me just give you the data points. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  So we know that China raised its retaliatory tariffs on the US goods to 125 percent. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=130.42000000000002s)]
*  China's leader Xi Jinping put out a message, we're not afraid, we'll go until the end. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=137.1s)]
*  We're not going to go out and reach out to Donald Trump at all. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=142.98s)]
*  We're not going to beg. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=147.5s)]
*  China is a proud country. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  The statement that was also issued from China's foreign ministry is, quote, given that the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=151.9s)]
*  current tariff level US exports to China are no longer even commercially viable, China's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=157.1s)]
*  not going to respond to any further tariff hikes by the US on Chinese goods. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=163.7s)]
*  China's Ministry of Finance said in a statement to the media on Friday. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=169.22s)]
*  Let me give you some additional data points though here. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=173.01999999999998s)]
*  Here is China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson or Ministry of Foreign Affairs. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=176.17999999999998s)]
*  I want you to listen to what he says as he announces the 125 percent tariff on US goods. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=189.33999999999997s)]
*  I want to emphasize that there are no winners in tariff wars and trade wars. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=190.34s)]
*  China is unwilling to fight, but is also not afraid to fight. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=201.9s)]
*  I want to emphasize if the US really wants to resolve issues through dialogue and negotiation, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=207.12s)]
*  they should stop the extreme pressure and reckless actions. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=214.74s)]
*  China has never bought into that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=219.18s)]
*  Any dialogue must be based on equality, respect, and reciprocity. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=222.1s)]
*  If the United States insists on engaging in a tariff and trade war, China will certainly [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=230.18s)]
*  see it through to the end. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=235.14s)]
*  China is a responsible country. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=238.94s)]
*  Our countermeasures against the United States bullying are to safeguard our legitimate rights [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=241.9s)]
*  and interests, uphold international rules and order, protect the common interests of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=247.54s)]
*  countries worldwide, and maintain international fairness and justice. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=254.66s)]
*  Yielding and compromising in the face of American bullying and overbearing behavior leaves nowhere. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=261.62s)]
*  Then I think there's a number of data points from this well-known China analyst and businessperson [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  Victor Gao saying that China will fight to the very end in any trade war after Trump [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=273.44s)]
*  hit China with 145% tariffs. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=280.48s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=283.44s)]
*  China is fully prepared to fight to the very end because the world is big enough that the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=284.44s)]
*  United States is not the totality of the market in the world. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=290.28s)]
*  So if the United States wants to go in that direction of completely shutting itself out [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=294.12s)]
*  of the China market, be my guest. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=299.04s)]
*  China will lose the US market, which as I've said is 15%. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=302.08s)]
*  We don't care. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  We don't care. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  China has been here for 5000 years. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  Most of the time there was no United States and we survived. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=311.35999999999996s)]
*  And if the United States wants to bully China, we will deal with the situation without the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=315.28s)]
*  United States and we expect to survive for another 5000 years. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=320.36s)]
*  Here's Gao again saying that China will never kiss Trump's ass. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=328.32s)]
*  He said just a few hours ago that countries are calling up. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=330.52s)]
*  Many countries are calling up. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=334.0s)]
*  He used the phrase kissing my ass. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=335.4s)]
*  Would China ever do that? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=338.4s)]
*  China will never do that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  And that is the most demeaning thing for a president of a country to say about his counterparts [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  in other countries. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=349.28s)]
*  Therefore, I think President Trump should really learn how to be a better president [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=350.28s)]
*  for the United States. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=356.28s)]
*  And the United States has always claimed to be the leader of so many countries, all [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=357.76s)]
*  of the world, as they claim, try to be a better leader rather than throwing huge wedges into [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=363.2s)]
*  other countries, trying to break their spirits and claiming victory. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=369.76s)]
*  Whereas there is no victory because such activities will only create resentment, especially among [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=374.24s)]
*  its allies. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=380.76s)]
*  Have you heard about the crime that the FBI calls house stealing? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=381.76s)]
*  It's a growing real estate scam targeting American homeowners and their equity. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=385.4s)]
*  And here's how it works. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=389.67999999999995s)]
*  Criminals forge your signature on one document, use a fake notary stamp, pay a small fee and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=391.32s)]
*  file with your county. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  Just like that, your home title has been transferred out of your name. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=398.34s)]
*  Then they take out loans using your equity or even sell your property. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=402.65999999999997s)]
*  And you won't even know it's happened until you start getting collections or foreclosure [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=407.64s)]
*  notices. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=412.56s)]
*  Let me ask you, when was the last time you checked your home title? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=413.56s)]
*  Now if you're like me, the answer is never. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=417.96s)]
*  And that's exactly what scammers are counting on. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=421.08s)]
*  That's why you need to stop what you're doing right now and find out today if you're already [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=424.16s)]
*  a victim. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=428.16s)]

*  And here Victor Gao talks about building relations with Europe. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=475.14s)]
*  And also what I like that Victor Gao says here is he goes, look, why don't we just view [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=479.62s)]
*  this just based on the facts and evidence and view it dispassionately? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=484.26s)]
*  He says, he goes, look, we are supporting a free trade. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=488.09999999999997s)]
*  He's saying, I just want you to see whether you believe that China is doing this or not. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=492.7s)]
*  The problem is if you're trying to say that you want to create deterrence against China's [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=497.94s)]
*  expansion, it sounds a whole lot more rational than what Trump is feeling. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=503.46s)]
*  And that's a problem. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=510.12s)]
*  When you know, if you're trying to, if you believe that there's an adversarial trade [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=511.85999999999996s)]
*  between the United States and China, Trump is opening up this kind of gaping hole in [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=518.1s)]
*  leadership for China to fill this void, both in terms of the expansion of the BRICS block, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=524.22s)]
*  but also China reaching out to Canada, Australia, which they're doing Europe and elsewhere and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=529.6s)]
*  saying you can't rely on them. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=535.4200000000001s)]
*  We want to step in. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=537.1s)]
*  Let's figure out how to work together. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=538.1s)]
*  So what Victor Gao says here is he's like, look, we support free trade. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=539.9200000000001s)]
*  We support sovereignty of nations. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=544.6s)]
*  We're not going to tariff you. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=546.82s)]
*  We only want to be supportive. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=548.74s)]
*  On the other hand, you've got Trump behaving like a bully. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=550.24s)]
*  Just listen for yourself. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=554.1s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=555.82s)]
*  I think the choice is not between China or the United States. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=556.82s)]
*  The real choice is between whether the United States is doing the right thing or the wrong [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=560.1400000000001s)]
*  thing or whether China is doing the right thing or the wrong thing. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=564.82s)]
*  In this case of global tariff war launched by the United States against the rest of the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=568.6s)]
*  world, the United States is doing the wrong thing. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=573.34s)]
*  There are all the evidence to prove it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=576.18s)]
*  And China is the major stabilizing force in the world, promoting what? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=578.4599999999999s)]
*  Promoting free trade, promoting protection, the international trading order. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=583.42s)]
*  So I think the choice is quite clear. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=588.18s)]
*  Regardless of what EU or Europe will do, China will continue to do the right thing. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=590.3399999999999s)]
*  That is to stand up firm and to strike back at the wrongful deeds of global warfare using [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=595.3599999999999s)]
*  tariff as a weapon against so many other countries. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=603.02s)]
*  So I think without Europe, China will continue to do the right thing. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=606.3s)]
*  I think China and Europe are really resizing up each other. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=609.42s)]
*  And we are talking about whether we can sign up the comprehensive agreement of investment. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=613.22s)]
*  There are even talks about maybe it is time for China and Europe to start the process [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=617.82s)]
*  of discussing the agreement of free trade between China and EU. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=623.0s)]
*  And EU recently made a decision to abandon the so-called tariffs against the China made [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=630.38s)]
*  the EV car. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=636.5s)]
*  And they want to set up a minimum price for the China made EV car in the European market. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=637.86s)]
*  So I think the signs are very encouraging. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=643.46s)]
*  China and EU or China and Europe should not view each other as enemies. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=646.82s)]
*  We should become real partners to get things done for mutual benefit. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=652.26s)]
*  It should also be noted too that as I mentioned, China and Europe growing closer together. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=657.54s)]
*  Great work, Donald, making that happen. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=662.4599999999999s)]
*  European tourism to the United States is free falling. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=666.38s)]
*  Remember I said this is we of course know about the Canadian boycott of all things American [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=669.3s)]
*  and boycott of tourism. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=674.54s)]
*  And I said what Canada is doing there is going to spread to Europe. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=676.14s)]
*  I said they're going to do the boycotts in Europe also. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=682.62s)]
*  Just watch. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=684.98s)]
*  That's what we're seeing happen right now. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=685.98s)]
*  Europe boycotting tourism to the United States. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=687.7s)]
*  And also not just because the United States has declared trade wars on them, but also [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=689.9s)]
*  because it's dangerous. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=695.1800000000001s)]
*  You go to the United States, you may end up in an ICE detention center or be sent to El [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=696.9s)]
*  Salvador without due process at all. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=701.1s)]
*  I showed you before that China's commerce ministry said that the United States has become [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=704.66s)]
*  a joke. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=710.58s)]
*  The ministry said Washington's repeated use of excessively high tariffs has become a little [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=711.8s)]
*  more than a number game, economically meaningless and revealing its use of tariffs as a tool [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=716.5s)]
*  of bullying and coercion. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=721.9599999999999s)]
*  Also US told China, can you please have Xi Jinping call Donald Trump? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=724.8599999999999s)]
*  Trump is caving left and right. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=730.04s)]
*  He's begging for a call like a desperate person. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=731.76s)]
*  As Geiger Capital puts it, doesn't have to be one gender or the other. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=735.0799999999999s)]
*  And then I told you about the Chinese officials trolling Trump with memes as the US tariff [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=740.2s)]
*  battle with China rages. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=745.2800000000001s)]
*  It's less of a battle and more of China clobbering the United States right now. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=746.9200000000001s)]
*  There's images like this. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=751.36s)]
*  This is China's attitude. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=752.5600000000001s)]
*  Chinese netizens mock US tariffs with memes. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=753.9200000000001s)]
*  You see there Trump and Musk and JD Vance and that AI meme. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=757.5600000000001s)]

*  This is the CEO of Apple of course. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=796.56s)]
*  And here he talks about why Chinese labor and why is such a reliable market. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=800.28s)]
*  He goes because the labor is smart. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=809.0799999999999s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=812.16s)]
*  There's a confusion about China. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=813.16s)]
*  Let me at least give you my opinion. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=815.4799999999999s)]
*  The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=817.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure what part of China they go to but the truth is China stopped being the low [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=823.88s)]
*  labor cost country many years ago. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=828.84s)]
*  The reason is because of the skill. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=831.96s)]
*  The quantity of skill in one location and the type of skill it is. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=834.4s)]
*  The products we do require really advanced tooling and the precision that you have to [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=839.6s)]
*  have in tooling and working with the materials that we do are state of the art. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=845.72s)]
*  The tooling skill is very deep here. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=850.4s)]
*  In the US you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I'm not sure we could fill the [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeJI_aV3meg&t=854.3199999999999s)]
