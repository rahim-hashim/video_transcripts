# Trump LOSES IT as MAGA Burns IT ALL DOWN
**MeidasTouch:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU)
*  Take a look, Donald, they're burning the MAGA hats. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=0.0s)]
*  The MAGA supporters of Donald Trump are livid and feel betrayed for a variety of reasons, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=3.6s)]
*  including Donald Trump covering up the Epstein files. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=10.24s)]
*  We have total chaos and hell breaking loose within the MAGA world. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=13.92s)]
*  A basic civil war is kind of taking place. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=18.88s)]
*  You know Rasmussen, the poll that Donald Trump loves? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=21.76s)]
*  He loves citing Rasmussen. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=24.64s)]
*  Here's what Rasmussen said yesterday. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=26.48s)]
*  The Republican party is going into a mutiny. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=28.48s)]
*  It's just a matter of when it's going to take place. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=32.56s)]
*  You have people, MAGA influencers posting this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=36.64s)]
*  The Epstein list will never be released. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=39.76s)]
*  There will be no arrest. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=41.92s)]
*  There will be no accountability. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=43.04s)]
*  There will be no justice. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=44.4s)]
*  That is how I and so many others feel right now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=45.84s)]
*  We've been had Elon Musk goes, yep, that is right. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=48.56s)]
*  You have people posting, burn your MAGA hats over and over again. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  This is what happens with Donald Trump and all of these Ponzi schemes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=59.92s)]
*  Eventually the people who are being had, they figure it out. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=64.4s)]
*  Also, Elon Musk is basically unfollowing now every MAGA account at once. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=68.08s)]
*  Got that going on. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=74.64s)]
*  You have Gunther Eagleman, a big right-wing MAGA influencer says, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=76.72s)]
*  Donald Trump is going after James Comey and John Brennan. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=82.16s)]
*  He goes, is the Comey investigation a distraction from the Epstein files? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=85.6s)]
*  And then Cat Turd, one of the big right-wing influencers is like, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  what the F are you doing? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=94.24s)]
*  Did you not get our talking points? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=95.84s)]
*  What the F are you doing, man? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=97.84s)]
*  While all of this is going on, as I've said before, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=99.84s)]
*  there's also just an issue of basic freaking competence. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  Christine Noem, what a vile piece of trash. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=106.72s)]
*  And I know you get angry sometimes when you go, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=110.4s)]
*  hey, Ben, don't do the name calling. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=113.44s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  Noem didn't authorize FEMA's deployment of urban search and rescue teams until Monday [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=117.12s)]
*  in the Kerr County region in Texas, more than 72 hours after the flooding began, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  multiple sources told CNN. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=132.0s)]
*  You see what happened is as they were eliminating FEMA [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  and gutting all of these agencies like NOAA, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=137.2s)]
*  the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=139.6s)]
*  and NWS, the National Weather Service, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=142.64s)]
*  one of the things that Noem did is there was any expenditure over $100,000 [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=145.76s)]
*  and needed her personal signature. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=151.28s)]
*  So the people at FEMA said they were ready with the supplies, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=153.44s)]
*  with the urban search and rescue equipment, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=157.44s)]
*  with the swift boats, with all of the things that they needed. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=159.68s)]
*  And she would not sign off on it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  You know what she was doing all night on Sunday? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=164.72s)]
*  She was posting photos of herself on Instagram and polling people, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=167.84s)]
*  which should be her governor's portrait, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=173.68s)]
*  the blondie photo, the cowgirl photo, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=176.16s)]
*  which one do people like the best right there? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=179.36s)]
*  And that's why it makes me so utterly angry. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=182.16s)]
*  And as they give us more fake stats from the Trump regime, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=184.4s)]
*  like what was the latest one from the Labor Department? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=187.76s)]
*  100% of new jobs all come from Americans. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=190.72s)]
*  100%. There's no non-American jobs that have been created. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=194.24s)]
*  What the hell are they talking about? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=198.08s)]
*  Remember when I showed you that 33,000 jobs were lost last month, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=200.0s)]
*  according to the ADP private payroll data? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  But miraculously, when you added government jobs [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=208.56s)]
*  with which the Trump regime says they were cutting, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=211.12s)]
*  all of a sudden the Trump regime stats from their Commerce and Labor Department said [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  147,000 jobs were created. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  Interesting that it would have the number 47 in it [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=220.96s)]
*  and all of these government jobs and teaching jobs [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=223.68s)]
*  were the reason that there was all of this growth and not from the private sector. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  Do you believe anything coming out of this regime right now? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=231.12s)]
*  And as I said at the outset, MAGA is waking up, burning their MAGA hats. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=234.56s)]
*  One of the things we learned as well is that Amazon's first day traffic [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=238.32s)]
*  for Amazon Prime Day is down 41% right now. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  Online shopping is seeing its overall biggest slowdown [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=248.88s)]
*  in over a decade as tariffs disrupt e-commerce. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=253.2s)]
*  And you may be saying, but that's different, Ben, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=256.56s)]
*  than what Donald Trump and the regime are saying. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  Isn't it interesting when the data comes from third-party independent sources [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=261.28s)]
*  that are just reporting the comparables and the data? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=266.4s)]
*  It's one thing, but when the Trump regime reports it, it's another thing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=269.52s)]
*  So what all of these groups is it's a massive conspiracy taking place [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=273.36s)]
*  where all these different groups, ADP and all these groups that take all this other data, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=277.28s)]
*  they're lying. Why? They're the deep state that's trying to go after Trump, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=281.2s)]
*  or maybe the guy who's lied his entire life, who's been found civilly liable for fraud, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  who's bankrupt in multiple business, who is an actual felon for business records fraud, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=289.12s)]
*  who is a sexual abuser found liable for such, who brags about sexually assaulting women [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  because he's rich and gets away with it. Maybe that's the bad guy in all this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=299.36s)]
*  Maybe there's a common thread, MAGA people who are burning your freaking hats right now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=303.68s)]
*  Donald Trump held a disastrous, weird meeting with five African leaders, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=308.56s)]
*  and he was asked a question. Sir, can you explain how you calculate your tariffs, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=314.56s)]
*  what you just did a tariff against Brazil for 50% because you want them to release Jair Bolsonaro, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=320.16s)]
*  who launched a coup against Brazil, and you're claiming that there's a deficit with Brazil when [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=327.36s)]
*  there was a surplus over the past 10 to 15 years with Brazil, 25 or 30% with the Sultan of Brunei, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=331.44s)]
*  30% of Iraq. Where are you getting these numbers from Donald? How are you coming up with them? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=337.52s)]
*  He goes, you know, it's just like common sense, man. It's like common sense. You're playing this [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=344.0s)]
*  clip. Sir, can you explain how you calculated your latest round of tariffs? Was there a formula that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=348.24s)]
*  was used? And do you expect any of these countries to face tariffs as well? The formula was a formula [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  based on common sense, based on deficits, based on how we've been treated over the years, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=361.92s)]
*  and based on raw numbers. And we're going to have a couple of more coming out today. Brazil, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=369.92s)]
*  as an example, has been not good to us, not good at all. We're going to be releasing a Brazil number, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  I think, later on this afternoon or tomorrow morning. But they're based on very, very substantial [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  facts and also past history. You look at the past history, we've been, we never had anybody [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=388.32s)]
*  in the White House that understood the numbers or were into it like I have. You know, we've taken in [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=395.76s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, hundreds of billions, and we haven't even started yet. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=402.4s)]
*  Really common sense as the Homeland Security Department is posting memes like this. Just think [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=408.88s)]
*  about that. This is from the official Homeland Security account. Fire up the deportation planes, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=416.16s)]
*  and it is a skeleton that is bench pressing or lifting. My body is a machine that turns [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=422.56s)]
*  ICE funding into mass deportations. Funny man, ha ha, you're disappearing off the streets. What [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  a funny freaking joke. What a nutcase lunatic fascist regime that we have right there. Look, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=435.76000000000005s)]
*  you have Mago Republican Senator Tom Tillis calling out the regime. A little late, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=442.4s)]
*  Tom Tillis. And Tom Tillis explains that he voted against the disastrous budget bill. He's the senator [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=447.28s)]
*  from North Carolina. Trump started attacking him, and he's like, I'm not going to put up with this [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  bullshit. Well, you put up with this bullshit, Tom Tillis, for a pretty long time and screwed a lot [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=456.88s)]
*  of us over. Here, play this clip. And I've probably done it more than many. Every time I'm very frank [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=461.2s)]
*  with him, but he has never been untoward, never raised his voice. He just goes on social media [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=467.2s)]
*  and does it. Yeah, well, that's the first time he ever did. And so after he did that, after I, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=473.84s)]
*  you know, I tell the president that he's clearly got the votes, that I will try and work to get [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=479.92s)]
*  something done in the House. He didn't need my vote and that I would be respectful and quiet and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=486.0s)]
*  try to do my work on the House side. And then I got that text that I texted him. I saw the, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=491.36s)]
*  I'd never read it, but I saw like the first sentence. I told the president and another [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti7Mq9S9tU&t=497.52000000000004s)]
