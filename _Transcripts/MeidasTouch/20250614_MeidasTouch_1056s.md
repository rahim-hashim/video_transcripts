# GOP makes TOTAL FOOLS of THEMSELVES as Plan BLOWS UP
**MeidasTouch:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4)
*  Donald Trump and the GOP know what a disaster this budget bill and how underwater they are in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=0.0s)]
*  polling about the budget bill. I think only 27% of Americans approve of this disastrous bill. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=6.16s)]
*  That's a good thing in the sense that the word is getting out and people realize 15, 16 million [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=14.0s)]
*  people in America can be losing their health care if this budget bill passes. And, you know, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=19.92s)]
*  the status of this bill after the House sent it to the Senate. I need to get more clarity on what [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=25.84s)]
*  the heck is even going on, but we're getting more data every day and it does not paint a rosy picture [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=31.68s)]
*  to say the least for this disastrous budget bill. This is the headline from Rolling Stone. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Theft, Trump's big beautiful bill. I hate that name by the way, really screws the poor. The [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=42.96s)]
*  president's latest round of tax cuts for the rich will be funded in part by taking money from the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  poorest 30% of American households. Like if you're making over $4.2 million, you're going to get [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=54.72s)]
*  $300,000, $400,000 more dollars in your pocket while literally people making under $50,000 [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=61.44s)]
*  who need that money are having the money like literally stolen and given to the richest Americans. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=68.4s)]
*  You take a look right here of some of the analysis by the Budget Lab, another nonpartisan group. The [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=74.72s)]
*  bottom 80% of Americans will be poorer as a result of this disastrous budget bill. In addition to the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=79.92s)]
*  tariffs, as I mentioned, 16 million people will lose health care. You know, and one of the things [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  too that I've been noticing as these Trump cabinet members have been showing up to these hearings [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=94.56s)]
*  and they've been asked to present like the specifics of like the budget or like, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=99.92s)]
*  so what is the Iron Dome? Like what does it actually mean? They don't even have like answers. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=105.12s)]
*  What are you allocating $200, $300 billion for? I mean, there was this one moment in the Senate [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  hearings where Democratic Senator Chris Coons held up the defense budget and it was literally a one [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  of those like 404 page not found error pages. That's what they've submitted. And it's not just [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=123.76s)]
*  been the Defense Department, cabinet member after cabinet member, top official after top official. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=131.36s)]
*  And this is unprecedented. It's not normal that you show up. Basically, it's like showing up to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=136.4s)]
*  school without your homework. They show up and then, you know, the Republican senators and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  congressmen, they're getting a little fed up, but it's like performative. And the Democrats like, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=146.72000000000003s)]
*  where we're in the budget committee, where's the budget? Where's your line items? Where's anything [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=151.44000000000003s)]
*  that you're doing? You know, and it just reminds me of everything that Trump did in all of his [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=157.68s)]
*  businesses, which most of them went bankrupt, just makes up numbers, makes two trillion, three [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=163.04s)]
*  trillion, six trillion, 800 billion. You just, all you got to do is market it big, beautiful, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=168.4s)]
*  BB BB BB and then people will, you know, support it. And then I think here's an important point, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=173.68s)]
*  though, there's a lot of serious things going on and I'm not going to say they're intentional [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=179.92s)]
*  distractions. I mean, to me, it's symptomatic of the dangers of the Trump regime, like the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=185.2s)]
*  fact that you have in the Department of Homeland Security, Chief Kristi Noem is speaking and a [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=190.64s)]
*  California senator gets like piled drive to the ground by FBI agents and arrested and that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  occupies a news cycle or Donald Trump fails to negotiate a nuclear deal, which was supposed [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  to happen on Sunday with Iran and Netanyahu views Trump as being utterly weak and kind of interferes [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=211.68s)]
*  with the negotiations of the nuclear deal. And now you have a war raging in the Middle East. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=217.84s)]
*  I'm not saying that that's there to purely distract from the budget bill, but it can be distracting. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=223.28s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump throwing a military parade for himself this weekend, by the way, using the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  Lollapalooza signs, fence jumpers will be prosecuted. They're using the Lollapalooza [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=234.16s)]
*  fence jumper sign right there. And it's just one direction after another, you know, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=240.64s)]
*  even Senator Alex Padilla from California said, look, what happened to me is terrible, but stay [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=247.68s)]
*  focused on the disastrous budget bill. I know who's staying focused on this disastrous budget bill, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=253.6s)]
*  Democratic Congress member Brendan Boyle, who's the Democratic ranking member of the budget [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=259.12s)]
*  committee. You've been checking in here at the Midas Touch Network about every two weeks or so [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  on the status of it, give or take. So as we do this interview today, where are we heading into [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=270.24s)]
*  the weekend of June 14, June 15? Where do things stand? Well, great to be back with you. And yeah, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=276.16s)]
*  the bill passed the House a couple of weeks ago and is now sitting in the Senate. Although we have [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=281.68s)]
*  had some updates from Congressional Budget Office on the full impact of this bill and what they have [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=287.68s)]
*  found is originally they were saying 13.7 million Americans would lose their health care because of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=294.96s)]
*  Republican cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. However, their previous estimate actually [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=300.8s)]
*  wasn't reflective of the last minute changes Republicans made to the bill in order to win the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=307.36s)]
*  votes of some real Freedom Caucus hardliners. The change is now 16 million Americans in total will [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=312.88s)]
*  lose their health care coverage as a result of the Republican cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=321.6s)]
*  Care Act. So that's the first big news kind of breaking this past week. The other big item, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=328.0s)]
*  and again, this is also from the Congressional Budget Office, just came out two days ago. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=334.32s)]
*  They did what they call the distribution tables. Basically, who's going to get what based on where [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=339.44s)]
*  you are in terms of household income? It turns out the bottom one third of the United States [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=345.36s)]
*  income distribution, basically every household making under $55,000 a year, will actually lose [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=354.16s)]
*  money as a result of this Republican tax cut. It is a tax cut for the top 1%. But for the bottom [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=361.36s)]
*  third of Americans, they will actually be poor off due to all of the cuts actually being greater [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=369.28s)]
*  in total amount than any sort of pittance of a tax cut. And for the middle class in this country, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  you'll be held flat. So the poor will be poor, the rich will be richer, and nothing for the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  middle class of this country. So I saw some of these Republicans who I think like to think of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=390.08s)]
*  themselves as moderate. In my own opinion, there's nothing moderate about them. At least 13 of them [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=396.88s)]
*  wrote this letter to the Senate asking for help. These are people who voted for the budget bill in [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  the House. They voted for these provisions. Then they send a letter to the Republicans in the Senate [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=409.92s)]
*  and they attack the bill. You would think that the dear colleague letter to the Senate was written by [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=416.8s)]
*  Democrats criticizing the thing, but it's written by the Republicans to the Republican senators [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=422.88s)]
*  saying, this is a bad bill. This is going to hurt our districts. This is going to result in tens of [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=428.48s)]
*  thousands of jobs in our congressional districts. We hope you will take your solemn response. This [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=433.2s)]
*  is for real. I'm like almost quoting it. We hope you will take your solemn responsibility serious [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=438.48s)]
*  as this goes to the Senate and make these corrections. And I'm reading this thing and I said, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=443.04s)]
*  y'all passed it. This is your thing. Why don't you do your damn job? What do you make of that, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=447.84s)]
*  Congressman? Yeah, you can't make this up. When I was growing up, I grew up in a little row home in [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=453.44s)]
*  a blue collar neighborhood of Philly and we had a very small front porch. There was always this [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=460.0s)]
*  folding chair that the minute you touched it, it immediately folded. I think of that old folding [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  chair on our front porch whenever they talk about the Republican moderates going to stand up and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=474.24s)]
*  actually vote no on something. I have never once ever seen so-called House Republicans stand up and [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=479.36s)]
*  vote against what their leadership is telling them to vote. And the fact that they know that this bill [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=488.0s)]
*  is so bad that they would write the Senate, basically asking Senate Republicans to have the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=494.48s)]
*  courage that they lacked is really comical. The reality is, however, I will be quite surprised [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=499.2s)]
*  if we see Senate Republicans do anything different than House Republicans did. They are afraid of [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=508.4s)]
*  Donald Trump. They may privately grumble about him. They may send press releases or tweets [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=515.04s)]
*  expressing concern about the Medicaid cuts, concern about the cuts to the Affordable Care Act. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=522.64s)]
*  They are always so concerned, but when push comes to shove, they will vote for it because they will [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=528.72s)]
*  do whatever Donald Trump tells them to do. It's weird. I mean, it's just a strange thing. It's [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=534.48s)]
*  dangerous. But as I just watch it, I just, I can't understand it. I mean, I see Donald Trump, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=540.4s)]
*  this weirdo guy. By the way, I like Gavin Newsom going after Donald Trump's cognitive issues as [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=550.0s)]
*  well because I'm seeing a guy who can't put together sentences. Like I'm seeing it every day. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=556.4s)]
*  He's speaking gibberish. He says one thing this day, one thing the next day, whatever happened to [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=561.68s)]
*  Alcatraz. It's the most ridiculous things that this guy is saying. This whole title, the fact [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=568.4s)]
*  that we're even calling big, beautiful bill, like what are we, like eight-year-olds? And the fact [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=574.9599999999999s)]
*  that like this is going on in Congress and you see people, I mean, some of these Republicans in [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=581.52s)]
*  Congress are educated and know better. I'm not suggesting all of them are, but then they just, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=587.6s)]
*  they fold for the guy. I mean, do they just, are they so fearful of just losing the job? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=596.64s)]
*  They love the proximity to power. They love the whiff of that orange turd. I mean, I just, I don't [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=603.76s)]
*  understand when you're a co-equal branch and you have power to help people to why you're doing this [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=610.64s)]
*  job, you cede it and you don't protect it. What's the point of the job? Yeah, I have to say, I often [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=619.92s)]
*  have exactly the same question. I really don't get it. You know, a lot of them are afraid. For most [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=628.0s)]
*  of them, of course, they live in districts that are deeply red. And so they're worried about the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=635.52s)]
*  primary, not the general. So they live in fear of Donald Trump bashing them or tweeting against them. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=639.28s)]
*  But I'll tell you what, as more and more Americans find out about the awful things in this bill, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=645.8399999999999s)]
*  just the healthcare cuts alone, the biggest cuts to healthcare in American history. And you know, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=652.3199999999999s)]
*  16 million people losing their healthcare because of Medicaid cuts, because of cuts to Obamacare, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=657.6s)]
*  that's bad enough. But the reality is all of our healthcare, even those of us who aren't on Medicaid [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=663.68s)]
*  or the Affordable Care Act, all of us will have our healthcare negatively impacted because we will see [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=670.0799999999999s)]
*  closures of hospitals, especially in rural areas, as well as urban areas. We will see longer lines [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=677.8399999999999s)]
*  in the ER. So 16 million Americans losing their healthcare is awful. It's historic, but it actually [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=684.88s)]
*  will be all 340 million of us in this country who will be worse off. And the more and more people [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=691.92s)]
*  find out about this, the worse the polling gets for Republicans. Right now, it's showing two to one [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=698.4s)]
*  opposition. But I think once this really fully seeps in with the American people, we will see [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=704.0s)]
*  those numbers get even worse from here. Let's do this exercise before we close this interview. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=711.5999999999999s)]
*  Let's actually kind of walk through in a real world way and help me kind of write the script. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=717.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm an American and I'm watching this. And let's say I'm making under $125,000 a year. And this [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=724.32s)]
*  budget bill passes, the Senate passes it, the House passes it. They go and they do the signing on the [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=733.36s)]
*  White House lawn. This is big. This is beautiful. Everybody's whatever. The next day, the next week, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=740.16s)]
*  the next month, just put yourself as Jane and John Doe, a husband and wife who are married, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=748.24s)]
*  pick your state, spell out the scenario of what they go through so we can make it in real terms. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=755.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So let's say, you know, obviously if you're on Medicaid, you're really vulnerable now to these [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=763.52s)]
*  cuts and a certain number of people will lose their health care. I mean, literally 11 million, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=770.56s)]
*  according to the Congressional Budget Office. If you're on, if you get your health care through [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=775.8399999999999s)]
*  one of the ACA exchanges, you're at risk of losing your health care. Some 5 million Americans will. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=780.16s)]
*  Let's say you're in a student loan repayment program. Now suddenly your repayment program [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=786.64s)]
*  is actually going to go away and be totally changed. You'll have a higher payment every month. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=791.68s)]
*  Let's say you have a kid who's in a pre-K program, maybe involved or getting their education through [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=796.7199999999999s)]
*  Head Start. Pretty dramatic cuts in that. Let's say you're helped through a nutrition assistance [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=801.76s)]
*  program. Devastating cuts there. But let's say you're someone who none of what I just said touches [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=806.8s)]
*  you. Guess what? We all are impacted by interest rates. Mortgage rate, auto loan rate, student loan [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=813.84s)]
*  repayment rate. Well, now because of the massive increase in the deficit and debt that is absolutely [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=824.5600000000001s)]
*  100% in this bill. And by the way, on that point, right-wing groups, left-wing groups, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=831.52s)]
*  centrist groups, nonpartisan groups have all reached the conclusion this will be the biggest increase [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=837.2s)]
*  in our nation's debt in American history. Now how does that affect John Q. Public? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=842.56s)]
*  Well, it turns out the bond market is not exactly enthusiastic about the idea that the U.S. is really [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=849.68s)]
*  ever seriously going to repay this debt. It is now so large and projected to go larger. And so [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=856.56s)]
*  they are charging a higher interest rate in order to buy our bonds. That impacts all of us. Next [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=863.44s)]
*  time you go to buy a car, next time you go to refinance your mortgage or buy a new home, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=871.84s)]
*  suddenly now your interest rate, by the way, I mean 7% interest rate right now in a 30-year mortgage, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=877.5200000000001s)]
*  that's going to be creeping up. It could be 7.5% and 8% after this bill passes. It could be even [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=884.1600000000001s)]
*  larger still. So those are the concrete ways, and there are many others, in which basically [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=889.92s)]
*  every American is going to be impacted in some way or another. Congressman Boyle, we appreciate [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=897.1999999999999s)]
*  you coming back on. What can an American do? What do you do right now? Educate other people, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=905.4399999999999s)]
*  I think is helpful. As you said, you're still like 20% of people with no opinion. I saw on that kind [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=912.24s)]
*  of Quinnipiac poll, get them to have an opinion one way or the other, but they should have an [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=917.76s)]
*  opinion on this and it should be strong. What else do you tell people to do right now? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=923.04s)]
*  Yeah, you're exactly right. I mean, the good news is for the 80% or so people who know about this [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=927.04s)]
*  bill, it's deeply unpopular, two to one unpopular over popular, but there are still a 20% chunk who [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=931.12s)]
*  aren't aware of it. And look, people are busy. There's a lot going on. Trump creates a different [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=938.88s)]
*  spectacle every day. This is actually the ball game. This is what matters most. This will have [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=943.6s)]
*  the biggest impact on people's lives for the next several years, really over the next decade. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=950.5600000000001s)]
*  So if you are about 80% and you know of the bill and you are concerned about it as you should be, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=956.96s)]
*  please inform the folks in your networks, in your household. The reality is most people get their [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=963.2s)]
*  information from their social peers, kind of their own informal networks. You actually have [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=970.72s)]
*  a lot more credibility with your family and friends than anyone on TV or anyone on the internet or [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=977.36s)]
*  anyone in elective office. So making sure that you help spread the word is vital. That's number one. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=982.72s)]
*  And then number two, turning up the heat on the Senate Republicans. I mean, there's a small margin [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=989.6800000000001s)]
*  over there. It's also a small margin in the House. Remember the bill, it passed a few weeks ago. It [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=995.6s)]
*  only passed by one vote. That bill is going to be changed in the Senate. It's going to have to come [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=1000.24s)]
*  back to us for another final vote. If we can literally just sway one or two House Republicans, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=1005.76s)]
*  that's 1% of the House Republican conference. Just 1% growing a backbone or perhaps becoming [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=1013.36s)]
*  more afraid of the American people than they are afraid of Donald Trump, that could make the [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=1019.6800000000001s)]
*  difference in stopping this big ugly bill from becoming law. Congressman Brendan Boyle, appreciate [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=1025.84s)]
*  you. Thank you. Everybody hit subscribe. Let's get to 5 million subscribers. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIkErsIqz4&t=1032.8799999999999s)]
