# Trump’s Attack on Canada BACKFIRES in HIS FACE
**MeidasTouch:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA)
*  Elbows up, Canada. Donald Trump's attack on Canada backfired big time. We're less than a week away [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=0.0s)]
*  from the elections in Canada taking place on April 28th. We already have the advance polls open. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=8.24s)]
*  Over 7.3 million Canadians have voted during the advance poll period. That is record setting, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=15.92s)]
*  Canadians are going elbows up. What's up, maple mitis? It's been such an honor over the past [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=24.32s)]
*  several months to get to know each other so much better. And frankly, we always knew from the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=32.4s)]
*  outset when the Midas Touch Network was started several years ago how important our Canadian [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=38.4s)]
*  viewers and Midas Mighty, now Maple Mitis, are. And so it's been an honor to be on this journey [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=46.0s)]
*  together. And my oh my has Donald Trump's plan backfired, right? Donald Trump was going to prop [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=52.24s)]
*  up MAGA Maple or Maple MAGA. He had his hand picked people and they were running the MAGA [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=59.52s)]
*  playbook, right? You go on the MAGA podcast like Jordan Peterson, Elon Musk endorses the MAGA Maple [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  candidate. He puts his thumb on the algorithm and starts amplifying the MAGA Maple, which is the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=76.56s)]
*  Pierre Poliev Conservative Party there. And then Donald Trump started his rhetoric about he wants [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=84.48s)]
*  to annex Canada. He wants to make Canada the 51st state. He started calling Prime Minister Trudeau, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=91.44s)]
*  Governor Trudeau, Prime Minister Trudeau very smartly gave the handoff to new leadership. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=99.6s)]
*  The Liberal Party held elections. You had Prime Minister Carney stepping into the fore. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=107.36s)]
*  You had the banker in Prime Minister Carney versus the bank ruptor in Donald Trump, a builder in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=114.72s)]
*  Prime Minister Carney versus a destroyer in Donald Trump. And Canada united, mostly all of the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=121.92s)]
*  provinces united, the premiers, regardless of political party really stood shoulder to shoulder [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=129.44s)]
*  other than Danielle Smith in Alberta. She's Maple MAGA as well. She was trying to work with Donald [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=136.48s)]
*  Trump in Mar-a-Lago to have Trump and Musk interfere with the Canadian elections to try to help [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=143.2s)]
*  Pierre Poliev, the leader of the Conservative Party there. When that was exposed, they tried to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=149.76s)]
*  have JD Vance's roommate and buddy from Yale, who's one of the henchmen for Pierre Poliev, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=155.92s)]
*  interfere in the elections with Donald Trump. The Canadians smoked that out. And Donald Trump [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=163.2s)]
*  continued his relentless attack on Canada's sovereignty. I mean, even yesterday in the Oval [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  Office, Trump reinserted himself into Canadian politics. He said he wants to increase the tariffs [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=176.4s)]
*  on auto against Canada. He used the rhetoric of Canada should be the 51st state. And let me be [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=183.6s)]
*  clear to those people living in America who don't know when Donald Trump says this, this ain't merely [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=191.12s)]
*  a trade war. These are words of war, annexation, conquest. It is the language of Putin against [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=198.16s)]
*  Ukraine. It is the way Putin says he wants to denazify Ukraine is Donald Trump saying he's trying [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  to get rid of all of the fentanyl from Canada into the United States, which doesn't exist, which is [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=215.2s)]
*  complete and utter BS, but it's pretext for Donald Trump wanting to have a war against Canada. Let's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=220.64s)]
*  be clear about what the language is. So as Donald Trump attacked Canada, Canada went elbows up. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=227.36s)]
*  Pierre Poliev plummeted, plummeted in the polls. This is the headline from the Wall Street Journal [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  in the past 48 hours. How Canada's Trump-style candidate blew a 20-point polling lead. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  Pierre Poliev's populist message, let's take out populist and say MAGA message, was resonating [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  until Trump's antagonism, let's remove the word antagonism and use language of war against Canada, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=256.88s)]
*  pushed Canadians towards a former central banker. Here we are from Polling Canada, which is a good [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=265.36s)]
*  job aggregating these polls with five days to go. All of the major polls, whether it's 338, CBC, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  Polling Canada and Main Street all believe there will be a liberal party majority, which was [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=280.88s)]
*  unheard of just a few months ago that that would be the result. But folks, as we always say here, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=287.28s)]
*  polls don't vote. Let me repeat that. Polls don't vote. So everybody should be encouraged, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=294.48s)]
*  no matter where you are in the world, in democracies, to do your civic duty. You take a [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=303.36s)]
*  look at the polly market polling data and they're a kind of an open source betting site that takes [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=310.24s)]
*  the percentages of who they think is going to win or lose. So back on February 5th, Pierre Poliev had [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=317.76s)]
*  an 84% chance of winning. Today, Prime Minister Carney has an 84% chance of winning New High. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=325.6s)]
*  But as I said, and let me repeat it very, very clearly, polls don't vote, wagering doesn't vote, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=333.2s)]
*  people vote. Wherever you are in the world in democracies, do your civic duty. Now, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=341.52s)]
*  how bad is it for Pierre Poliev, Mr. Maple Maga, Mini Trump, Mini Elon? Let me tell you, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  the Conservative Party is afraid that he's going to lose his own riding, which for Americans is [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=356.56s)]
*  like his own congressional seat. They call them ridings in Canada. There are 343 ridings in Canada. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=364.16s)]
*  And in Canada, you don't vote for like your president or they're your prime minister. You [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=371.44s)]
*  vote in your riding for who's going to go to the House of Commons. And then the party that gets [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=376.24s)]
*  either the majority or who for if you don't get a majority and you get a plurality and you have to [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=382.48s)]
*  form a coalition, that's who becomes the prime minister, the leader of that party. So the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  Conservative Party is worried right now that Pierre Poliev is going to lose in his riding, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=393.20000000000005s)]
*  which again is unheard of, I mean, in Ottawa. So that would be like Maga Mike Johnson losing his [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=400.48s)]
*  congressional seat for our American viewers out there. Let's just go through the receipts, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=408.08s)]
*  how badly Donald Trump blew it or blowing it's not the right word, I think, exposed what was [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=414.32s)]
*  going on here, this right-wing authoritarian creep originating from Russia that pushed into the US. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=421.28s)]
*  And we've seen these other authoritarian Victor Orban style leaders, how that drift elevated by [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=429.84s)]
*  these right-wing podcasters was infecting Canada, but how it was revealed by Donald Trump's [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=436.8s)]
*  rhetoric, language and behavior. Like all things Donald Trump touches, they tend to die. So here [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  was Donald Trump on one of these right-wing podcasts just a few months ago saying how excited he was [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=450.88s)]
*  to work with Pierre Poliev, whose views align closely with Trump. Play this clip. Are you [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=457.04s)]
*  looking forward to working with Pierre Poliev, the new guy? I am. If that's what happens, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=462.96s)]
*  certainly it will be very good. Our views would be more aligned, certainly. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=469.76s)]
*  When we geek out for a minute on something, I think it's going to be helpful for you. It's [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  called FATI 15. Its co-founder, Dr. Stephanie Van Watson, discovered C15 as the first essential [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=478.64s)]
*  fatty acid to be found in 90 years while working with the US Navy to improve the health and welfare [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  of aging dolphins. It's pretty simple. Essential nutrients keep our cells healthy, which keeps us [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=490.8s)]
*  healthy. So if you want to get sciency about it, studies show that C15 works by strengthening [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=496.08s)]
*  our cells, improving our mitochondrial function and protecting us against damaging free radicals. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=501.76s)]
*  If you feel like, how could I stop aging faster or I'm sleeping poorly or feeling sluggish? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  The bottom line is that many of us are deficient in C15, which results in weaker cells, which [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=514.32s)]
*  results in those things. So FATI 15 is the science-fact award-winning vegan and pure C15 [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=519.44s)]
*  supplement that steps in and helps. It works in multiple ways. It repairs age-related damage to [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=525.2800000000001s)]
*  cells. It protects them from future breakdowns. It boosts mitochondrial energy output and activates [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=531.44s)]
*  pathways in the body that help regulate sleep, mood, natural repair mechanisms that support our [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=537.0400000000001s)]
*  overall health. So deeper sleep, smoother functioning joints, healthier hair, skin and nails, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  that's essential. And the C15 helps here and FATI 15 delivers. So it comes in these gorgeous, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=546.88s)]
*  reusable glass bamboo jars and refill capsules that are shipped to your door quarterly in [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=552.48s)]
*  pouches made from recycled materials. I love that. FATI 15 is on a mission to replenish [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=557.84s)]
*  your C15 levels and restore your long-term health. You can get an additional 15% off [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=564.0s)]
*  their 90-day subscription starter kit by going to fatty15.com slash mitis and using the code [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=569.76s)]
*  mitis at checkout. That's fatty15.com slash mitis, FATTY15.com slash mitis, M-E-I-D-A-S. Use that code [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=575.68s)]
*  mitis at checkout, M-E-I-D-A-S. I'm bringing out all the receipts here, folks, because I want to tie [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=585.76s)]
*  this all together right now. So then Jordan Peterson, right-wing podcaster, has Pierre [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=591.28s)]
*  Poliev on. They dropped the podcast episode on Elon Musk's ex. Jordan Peterson is asking [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=599.84s)]
*  Pierre Poliev all these questions about, woke this, woke that. It looked like a right-wing podcast [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=607.2800000000001s)]
*  interview with an American MAGA politician. Elon Musk lifts it up saying, this is a great, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=614.08s)]
*  great interview. And Jordan Peterson declares, this is the next prime minister of Canada, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=620.6400000000001s)]
*  Pierre Poliev. Pierre Poliev, Maple MAGA himself, and you go, Ben, stop saying Maple MAGA. He's not [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=626.64s)]
*  Maple MAGA. Really? Really? Okay. Let me come out with the receipts right here. This is what Pierre [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=631.92s)]
*  Poliev said after that interview on January 8th, 2025. This, you could replace Pierre Poliev with [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=636.24s)]
*  MAGA Mike Johnson, Donald Trump. You replace the name. Let me read this for you. You ready? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=642.88s)]
*  Dr. Peterson has paid an enormous price to go up against the woke censorship apparatus. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=647.84s)]
*  Thousands of common sense Canadians must self-censor for fear of losing their livelihoods [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=654.88s)]
*  with no way to feed their families. Sign to help me end woke authoritarian censorship so [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=660.56s)]
*  Canadians can take back control of their lives. Let me just show you a small portion of this [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=668.3199999999999s)]
*  interview, by the way, that Pierre Poliev himself posted. So Pierre Poliev, January 8th, he thinks [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=674.88s)]
*  he's going to win. He's spiking the football and he posts this. Play this clip. On behalf of all [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=682.24s)]
*  Canadians, want to thank you for your immense courage and the personal political price that you, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=687.6s)]
*  personal political and non-political price that you have paid for standing up for your convictions [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=692.0s)]
*  and defending freedom of speech. Because I know you have paid a very big price for that, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=697.44s)]
*  but you have never bent, you have never backed down. You've had a spine of steel [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=702.4s)]
*  and there are countless other people who will have the freedom to express themselves because [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=707.04s)]
*  you paid the price for them. So thank you. Thank you, sir. It's been a privilege far more than a [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=712.0s)]
*  price, definitely. And it continues to be that way. Okay. Now fast forward to this past week. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=717.04s)]
*  You have Jordan Peterson going on, da da da, the Joe Rogan show. So Peterson's on Rogan and [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=730.16s)]
*  Peterson basically says, and you see how upset he is. He's like, we blew it. Trump revealed the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=739.92s)]
*  plan, man. And then Rogan's like, yeah, but how did Trump realize that he shouldn't have said those [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=746.16s)]
*  things because he screwed the maple maga in Canada. Here, watch this interaction. Peterson's like, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=753.8399999999999s)]
*  we blew it. Here, play this clip. Carney showed up just in the nick of time to save the burning [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=761.52s)]
*  damsel from the train tracks or whatever the hell it is. And the rhetoric, and then Trump, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=766.88s)]
*  he just timed it so badly. And he didn't know. He didn't know what would it would do. He didn't [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=772.64s)]
*  know. But that's also, how do you not know the people have national pride? Yeah, he knew that, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=780.0799999999999s)]
*  but he didn't know what the electoral consequences would be. He didn't know that that would shift [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=788.64s)]
*  them to the liberals so radically. And he's going to pay for that because once Carney is elected, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=793.12s)]
*  if that happens, Trump will not have a more seasoned enemy in the West. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=799.92s)]
*  And again, just to show you also how creepy Pierre Poliev is, Pierre Poliev, and this is such like a [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=805.12s)]
*  Trump and JD Vance type thing, would go around conflating, he would call it a woman's biological [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=813.04s)]
*  clock. He's obsessed with women's biological clocks. He's like age 36, woman's biological clock, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=820.56s)]
*  like that, like JD Vance Trumpy. And he would conflate a woman's biological clock in his own [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=828.0s)]
*  words with Canada's housing market. Here, play this clip. And of course, let's be honest, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=834.4799999999999s)]
*  she said her biological clock is ticking. Her biological clock running out. There is the drama. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=840.4s)]
*  We will not forget that young 36 year old couple whose biological clock is running out faster. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=846.96s)]
*  The biological clock runs out in your mid 30s. If you're a young woman who's got a biological [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=853.9200000000001s)]
*  clock, obviously, we'll do the math. You know, you start off at, let's say you're 25. Well, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=859.5200000000001s)]
*  with their biological clocks running out. I used to say that you all said, oh, Poliev's exaggerating. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=866.32s)]
*  So you take Pierre Poliev and you contrast him to the leader of the Liberal Party, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=872.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Mark Carney, who puts out this video. Let's play it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=877.04s)]
*  Today, the Conservative Party released their platform. And it really only confirms what we [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=880.88s)]
*  already knew. That Pierre Poliev has no plan, no plan, to stand up to President Trump. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=888.24s)]
*  It's no surprise. This is a new situation. And he's the kind of politician who's never changed his mind [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=894.8s)]
*  since he was 17, but always relies on a reflex to cut, destroy and divide. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=903.3599999999999s)]
*  In today's Conservative platform, it's phantom numbers is no different. He wants to cut what [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=908.8s)]
*  Canada needs. With our plan, we will build to make Canada strong. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=915.76s)]
*  So then what happens yesterday? What goes down yesterday? You could see Pierre Poliev being like, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=923.52s)]
*  I could imagine what he, you know, that he's there and he finds out Trump does it again. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=933.12s)]
*  More 51st State Talk, more calling Prime Minister Trudeau, Governor Trudeau. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=941.04s)]
*  Watch what Donald Trump says yesterday in the Oval Office. Here, play this clip. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=946.88s)]
*  I asked Trudeau, who I call Governor Trudeau, I asked him, why are we spending $200 billion [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=951.04s)]
*  to support Canada, to subsidize Canada? And he was unable to answer the question. I mean, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=961.2s)]
*  why are we doing that? And I have to be honest, as a state, it works great as a nation, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=966.0s)]
*  considering the fact that most of the nation, you know, 95% of Canada, what they do is they buy from [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=974.88s)]
*  us and they sell to us. They sell to us. If we didn't buy their oil, if we didn't buy their, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=980.56s)]
*  and we don't need their oil, they're more oil than anyone, but we don't need their oil. We don't need [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=987.12s)]
*  their oil. We don't need their cars. We don't need anything. So I said, why are we doing this? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=992.0s)]
*  Why are we spending $200 billion? It doesn't make sense. If we need it. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=996.4s)]
*  And finally, let me share with you Bruce Fanjoy from the Liberal Party in an interview he did [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1000.4s)]
*  recently. Shout out to the interviewer here as well. This is the guy running against Pierre [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1008.8s)]
*  Poliev because Pierre Poliev is now vulnerable in his own riding in Ottawa. Watch this go down, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1016.0s)]
*  play this clip. Pierre Poliev made me do it. I recognized how tough a proposition it was to [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1022.64s)]
*  take on someone like him, a leader of a party. But I also knew that from all the people that I [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1028.48s)]
*  know in Carleton, which are quite a few, he doesn't represent who we are. And I felt that [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1038.48s)]
*  given his propensity to accomplish nothing, how he takes the riding for granted, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1049.92s)]
*  and nobody likes to be taken for granted, that he could be defeated. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1059.04s)]
*  So folks, as I said, and let me reiterate this again, at the end of the day, polls don't vote. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1064.32s)]
*  People vote. No matter how you end up voting in that election, I think it's just important, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1071.36s)]
*  wherever you are in the world, I think it's just important to understand people's intentions. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1080.24s)]
*  Why is Elon Musk, why was he involving himself? What was all this woke talk, the similarities? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1087.36s)]
*  What's going on here? You unpack it. You decide for yourself. But maple mitis, let me say this, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1094.8799999999999s)]
*  we're on a journey together. That's just the beginning. And it's been an honor that we've [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1103.6799999999998s)]
*  been the top possible. We've been the top possible. We've been the top possible. We've been the [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1109.6s)]
*  beginning. And it's been an honor that we've been the top podcast in Canada. It's an honor that you [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1113.76s)]
*  trust me and this network. We don't take that for granted any day. So thank you, thank you, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1120.8799999999999s)]
*  thank you from the bottom of my heart. We appreciate it. Have a great day and hit subscribe, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1129.04s)]

*  boycotting tourism. You've set an example for the rest of the world, Canada, about what to do [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1148.08s)]
*  and how to stand up to the bully. Canada, you're the front lines of democracy. See, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1154.48s)]
*  I thought I was going to end the video, but I want to recognize a few things. That's very true. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1159.6000000000001s)]
*  The courage that you've shown over the past several months is nothing short of heroic, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1165.68s)]
*  but it's not over the past several months. It's the history of Canada. If you go back to the world [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1171.8400000000001s)]
*  wars, if you go back to who's always been on the right side of history in the fight for democracy [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1178.24s)]
*  over time, and as Prime Minister Carney says, as others said, we've all, you know, countries make [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1185.3600000000001s)]
*  their mistakes. Countries don't all have these glorious histories, okay? But let me be very clear. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1190.8s)]
*  Canada has fought for democracy in all the world wars. Canada has been on the front lines of [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1195.9199999999998s)]
*  protecting, preserving democracy, of fighting back against Nazis, and standing up for a peaceful, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1201.04s)]
*  stable, loving pro-democracy world order. Thank you, Canada. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-ZrAiCzNA&t=1209.04s)]
