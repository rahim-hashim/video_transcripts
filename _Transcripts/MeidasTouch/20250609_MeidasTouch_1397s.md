# GOP Reps LOSE IT on LIVE TV as Trump GOES TO WAR with LA
**MeidasTouch:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ)
*  Maga Republican sheep, I mean, Maga Republican leaders making total fools of themselves over the weekend on various TV appearance. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  For example, here you have Maga Mike Johnson defending Donald Trump, potentially using the Marines against Americans. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=9.72s)]
*  And Maga Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, says that's peace through strength right there. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=20.28s)]
*  That's how you do it. Peace through strength is sending the Marines against people inside America. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=25.96s)]
*  Play this clip. Secretary Hagseth said that active duty Marines there at Camp Pendleton, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  there by San Diego, are on high alert and could be mobilized. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=39.04s)]
*  Could we really see active duty Marines on the streets of Los Angeles? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  You know, one of our core principles is maintaining peace through strength. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  We do that on foreign affairs and domestic affairs as well. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  I don't think that's heavy handed. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  I think that's an important thing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=54.44s)]
*  Marines into the streets of an American city is heavy handed. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  We have to be prepared to do what is necessary. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=58.96s)]
*  And I think the the notice that that might happen might have the deterring effect. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=60.96s)]
*  OK, peace through strength. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=65.64s)]
*  Are you out of your mind? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=67.84s)]
*  What kind of language is that attacking Americans with the Marines? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=70.16s)]
*  Next, I want to show you Maga Republican Congressmember Gonzalez. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  And here is great questioning by the host who asked Congressmember Gonzalez, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=79.28s)]
*  you know, back in November, this is what you said to all of us. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=84.83999999999999s)]
*  You said if Donald Trump starts going after migrants [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  who are not engaged in crimes, then it's over for Donald Trump, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  that that is going to be the end of his administration if he starts to do that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=96.84s)]
*  Watch Congressmember Gonzalez squirm. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=102.6s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  You said back in November, the administration would fail [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=107.72s)]
*  if it began going after nonviolent migrants. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=110.2s)]
*  You said if the messages were here to deport your Abuelita, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=113.2s)]
*  this is not going to work well. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  You heard our reporting. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=117.56s)]
*  People are getting arrested, going to court appearances, trying to abide by the law. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=119.72s)]
*  We have these cases of, for example, a 19 year old high schooler [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=124.48s)]
*  on his way to volleyball team practice in Massachusetts, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  arrested because his student visa had expired. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=130.76s)]
*  An Afghan soldier in Houston who used to guard American soldiers at bases [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=133.76s)]
*  with eight kids to his name arrested, even though he entered this country [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=138.88s)]
*  with legal status. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  Are these people the worst of the worst? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=144.72s)]
*  They're not. But when this is what's going to happen is as as these 400,000 [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=148.44s)]
*  asylum seekers that are in limbo, if you will, start to get deported. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=153.16s)]
*  Maria, who's 23 years old, that was from Honduras, that was was told [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=157.12s)]
*  to come to the United States for a better life and has gotten married [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=161.48s)]
*  and has had children as she gets ripped from that life and gets sent back [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=164.28s)]
*  to Honduras, it's going to be very painful for us. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=168.32s)]
*  What I'd like for us to do is focus on the convicted criminal [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  illegal aliens. Last year, I asked the administration. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  Is that happening? Because right now, it looks like they're trying [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=177.44s)]
*  to run up the numbers. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=180.6s)]
*  Last year, I asked the administration what that number was. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=181.92s)]
*  It was 662,000. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=184.56s)]
*  Last month, I asked as of July of last year. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  Last month, I asked Secretary Noem under under oath. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=189.64s)]
*  I asked her, has that number increased or has that number decreased? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=192.56s)]
*  She she she she responded that the number of convicted criminal [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=195.56s)]
*  illegal aliens has increased. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=199.48s)]
*  So that means we have over 600,000. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=201.2s)]
*  We should absolutely focus on that population. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=203.2s)]
*  The worst of the worst and make sure that those are the areas that get removed. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=206.16s)]
*  Otherwise, it's going to take us down this route of constant civil conflict. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  And then here, Congress member Gonzalez says, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=214.56s)]
*  Well, look, I support this escalation. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=218.52s)]
*  This is what you need to do. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=221.36s)]
*  You need to escalate right away and put that mob down as soon as possible. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=223.12s)]
*  The hell are you talking about? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=228.76s)]
*  You want to escalate to deescalate? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=230.56s)]
*  That's literally what you don't do. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=233.52s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=236.6s)]
*  It's tragic to see what's happening in in in L.A. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=237.48s)]
*  I spent 20 years in the military. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=239.88s)]
*  I fought in two wars. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=241.68s)]
*  I fought to give people the freedom to protest whatever the hell they want to. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=243.28s)]
*  But what we're seeing in L.A. are not advocates. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  We're seeing anarchists. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=250.04s)]
*  And the president of the United States should absolutely put down the mob [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=251.28s)]
*  as soon as possible. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=254.83999999999997s)]
*  But this is just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=255.88s)]
*  Are you comfortable with active duty Marines being put on high alert [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=257.76s)]
*  for possible deployment to quell a civil disturbance? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=261.0s)]
*  If need be. But, you know, you always want to escalate. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=264.56s)]
*  The will of the government. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=267.56s)]
*  You always want to escalate to deescalate. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=268.24s)]
*  But it first starts where you have to have local law enforcement get engaged. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=270.2s)]
*  But if local law enforcement is removed and then you don't have [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=273.96s)]
*  the state law enforcement, then who is going to take care of the people? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=276.6s)]
*  I want to. And then you have Mago Republican Senator Lankford. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=279.64000000000004s)]
*  And here, Kristen Welker from Meet the Press says, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=284.32000000000005s)]
*  but aren't people in the United States, whether you're here [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=288.12s)]
*  as a citizen or not, shouldn't you get due process and shouldn't you get a hearing? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=292.16s)]
*  And then Senator Lankford says, you know what? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=296.44s)]
*  The moment you just say to people you violated the law, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  that's all that that's called due process. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=304.04s)]
*  That's all they they don't need a hearing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=306.0s)]
*  All you have to do is say you did it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=307.76s)]
*  And then I guess you get to send them to concentration camps in El Salvador [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=309.88s)]
*  or Libya or Djibouti or wherever the hell they're sending them. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=313.92s)]
*  You're play this clip. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=317.24s)]
*  Well, it is worth noting the Constitution does say that all persons in the US [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=318.2s)]
*  are entitled to due process, doesn't make a distinction about citizenship. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=323.64s)]
*  I do want to move on, though, to this extraordinary fight. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=327.6s)]
*  But just just one, just one quick, just one quick statement. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=330.52s)]
*  The due process, as the court has ruled on an American citizen, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=333.32s)]
*  is different than someone who's not legally present in the country. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  It's a faster process. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=340.2s)]
*  Literally reading to them the statute and saying this is what you violated [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=341.84s)]
*  does count as due process, depending on how they actually entered into the country. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=345.2s)]
*  But I mean, the US has provided due process even to terrorists, Senator. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  You're saying that people who are here who have citizenship [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  aren't entitled to due process, even though the Fifth Amendment. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  No, I know not not saying that at all. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=361.32s)]
*  Because not yet. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=362.88s)]
*  Not saying that at all. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=364.28s)]
*  I'm just saying the due process is different for a citizen and a noncitizen. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  OK, it's a much faster process for a noncitizen. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=368.55999999999995s)]
*  OK, let's know quite literally the Constitution [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  requires that there be a hearing that there be process. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=375.35999999999996s)]
*  Let me be very clear where I stand. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  If you are a criminal, if you are in if you commit crimes in the United States, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=382.47999999999996s)]
*  you need to be held accountable for those crimes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm a law and order person. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=391.44s)]
*  You violate the law, throw the book at them. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=392.84s)]
*  But that's not what's going on here at all. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=396.96s)]
*  Donald Trump's regime is going after hardworking migrants [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=399.84s)]
*  who are working in factories, who are at the Home Depot parking lot, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=404.88s)]

*  the first emerging essential fatty acid to be discovered in more than 90 years. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=553.28s)]

*  and is a key to healthy aging nutrient, which helps to slow [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=583.3199999999999s)]
*  biological aging at the cellular level. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=587.0s)]
*  Now, in fact, when our cells don't have enough C15, they become fragile [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=589.96s)]
*  and age faster, and when our cells age, our bodies age too. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=595.04s)]

*  He or she is being asked about that fight. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=735.48s)]
*  And, you know, she's all [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=738.32s)]
*  let's watch it play the clip. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=740.32s)]

*  that there have definitely been healthy disagreements amongst the cabinet [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=777.4s)]

*  There were times in which they got frustrated with one another. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=782.04s)]

*  and the president's team, that they can have these robust disagreements [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=789.68s)]

*  so-called journalist put out on Twitter in the wee hours of the night. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=863.2s)]
*  Calling Stephen Miller vile. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=868.24s)]
*  They said that President Trump is a world class hater. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=869.92s)]
*  And this is, again, coming from someone who is supposed to be an unbiased [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=873.48s)]
*  and professional journalist. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=876.96s)]
*  This is unacceptable and unhinged rhetoric [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=878.8s)]
*  coming from someone who works at a major television network. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=881.8s)]
*  We have reached out to ABC. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=884.6s)]
*  They have said they will be taking action. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=886.68s)]
*  So we will see what they do. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=889.04s)]
*  And then you have Kristi Noem, who seems to be hanging out [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=890.6s)]
*  at the same locations as Caroline Levitt. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=894.56s)]
*  Kristi Noem on CBS says [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=898.64s)]
*  this is what she says about Donald Trump sending the National Guard [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=901.72s)]
*  and potentially the Marines against Americans in Los Angeles. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=905.28s)]
*  Play this clip back to the question, though, of active duty troops [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=909.3199999999999s)]
*  different from the National Guard. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=913.24s)]
*  What is your personal counsel here to the president? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=914.8s)]
*  Because it's you, the attorney general and the secretary of defense. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=918.8s)]
*  We're going to have a lot of responsibility here in implementing [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=921.68s)]
*  some of this call to do this. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=925.4s)]
*  Well, let me be clear about something. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=928.76s)]
*  ICE and Homeland Security are running these operations right now. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=930.36s)]
*  And the advice and counsel of the attorney general, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=933.64s)]
*  the Department of Defense are extremely important to the president [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=936.64s)]
*  of the United States, and we never discuss our personal conversation [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=939.84s)]
*  and advice to the president of the United States. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=943.36s)]
*  He makes the decisions. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=945.72s)]
*  He is the president that sits in that seat. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=947.48s)]
*  And we are all very proud to work for him. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=950.24s)]
*  So I'm grateful for the leadership, leadership of Pete Hegseth and Pam Bondi. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=952.56s)]
*  And I get the chance to work with them. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=957.04s)]
*  And as does their job today, we're thankful to have the partnership [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=958.64s)]
*  and the leadership of President Trump. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=962.48s)]
*  Well, some Republican senators like Senator Lankford [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=964.1999999999999s)]
*  has have said active duty Marines are not going to be put [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=967.28s)]
*  into local law enforcement. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=969.64s)]
*  So there are Republican lawmakers questioning this. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=971.1999999999999s)]
*  Here's what she says when she's asked about [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=974.12s)]
*  that Donald Trump is going to wants to make it unlawful [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=977.8399999999999s)]
*  for protesters to wear masks, but make it [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=981.7199999999999s)]
*  obligatory for ICE officers to wear masks. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=985.52s)]
*  And if you in any way try to photograph an ICE officer [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=989.84s)]
*  or let people know who they are who work for the government, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=993.6s)]
*  then you know, you get enhanced penalties or whatever. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=997.76s)]
*  You're treated like a terrorist. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1002.6s)]
*  Who the hell knows what this regime here's what she goes. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1003.92s)]
*  She goes, the laws in this country are what we're doing. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1006.4s)]
*  We're doing the laws. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1008.56s)]
*  We're doing the laws. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1010.16s)]
*  What are you talking about here? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1011.4s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1012.84s)]
*  President Trump said masks will not be allowed to be worn at protests. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1014.6s)]
*  Who's going to enforce that and how? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1018.48s)]
*  And how can you justify it when law enforcement officials [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1020.1999999999999s)]
*  have their faces covered? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1023.88s)]
*  You know, what I would say is that the law is going to be enforced [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1026.16s)]
*  and that what the laws are in this country is what we are doing. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1028.84s)]
*  And our ICE officers and our law officers out there [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1032.84s)]
*  that are in these situations where people have questioned [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1035.48s)]
*  why they have their faces covered. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1038.36s)]
*  It's for the safety of those individuals or the work that they're doing [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1040.16s)]
*  as far as protecting their identity so they can continue to do [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1043.32s)]
*  investigative work. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1046.1599999999999s)]
*  So are you tasking the National Guard soldiers [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1047.32s)]
*  with removing masks from protesters? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1051.24s)]
*  I mean, are you trying to use them in that way? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1053.6399999999999s)]
*  National Guard soldiers are there to provide security for operations [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1056.72s)]
*  and to make sure that we have peaceful protests. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1060.1599999999999s)]
*  So that's what their work is. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1062.08s)]
*  And I won't get more specific on that just because we never do [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1064.48s)]
*  when it comes to law enforcement operations. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1067.32s)]
*  We're doing the same standard procedures we always do. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1070.2s)]
*  And have for years in this country with our National Guard [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1073.24s)]
*  and with our law enforcement folks that are on the ground [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1076.44s)]
*  working with these communities. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1080.28s)]
*  I like this moment where Mag and Mike Johnson was asked about [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1081.76s)]
*  the Epstein files. Let's play this clip. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1084.88s)]
*  By the way, what do you know what he's talking about with the Epstein files? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1087.24s)]
*  I mean, what is it? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1090.28s)]
*  And why haven't those files been released? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1092.56s)]
*  Have you? I mean, some of your members have said they got to be released. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1094.72s)]
*  As as cash said in the vignette earlier, he's saying, yeah, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1098.76s)]
*  that's not my way. I don't know. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1101.9599999999998s)]
*  I can tell you that I don't think we have no concern about [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1103.8s)]
*  President Trump or is involved in any of that. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1106.4399999999998s)]
*  And in terms of this threat. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1108.3999999999999s)]
*  And here, Mag and Mike Johnson was asked, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1110.52s)]
*  so why did your budget bill [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1113.28s)]
*  focus on helping people who own tanning beds? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1116.48s)]
*  Why did you help the tanning bed? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1120.1599999999999s)]
*  Was it because Mr. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1123.32s)]
*  Orange, whatever you call him, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1126.84s)]
*  mango, Mussolini, I think I was talking about. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1130.16s)]
*  Is that why you were? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1132.68s)]
*  Why are you giving? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1134.0s)]
*  Why is your budget bill addressing tanning beds [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1135.08s)]
*  while screwing over the people and Mag and Mike's? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1137.88s)]
*  Well, look, the tanning bed industry really needs a lot of help right now. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1140.48s)]
*  Joe Biden did it. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1143.96s)]
*  And then ABC host is like, no, he didn't. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1145.52s)]
*  This was from 2010. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1148.1200000000001s)]
*  Biden did anything. Biden hurt. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1149.76s)]
*  Bob Biden hurt. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1151.72s)]
*  These guys are such fools playing this clip. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1154.2s)]
*  And we're right. What about tanning beds? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1156.32s)]
*  It eliminates a 10 percent tax on tanning beds. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1159.0s)]
*  I mean, how did how did that become a priority? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1161.68s)]
*  Well, that look, I think that was an unfair thing [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1163.48s)]
*  that the Biden administration put on an industry because they. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1166.3600000000001s)]
*  It was actually it goes back to 2010. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1169.4s)]
*  It's been around for 50 years, but the Biden administration enhanced it. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1171.0s)]
*  And there be modifications probably to that in the final package as well. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1174.1200000000001s)]
*  But we'll see how it comes out. OK. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1177.76s)]
*  So Mag and Mike, why was there a provision in the budget bill [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1180.04s)]
*  to remove all regulations from gun silencers? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1184.52s)]
*  Why was that gun silencers? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1189.6000000000001s)]
*  That's that one of the big beneficiaries. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1191.4s)]
*  And then Mag and Mike's like, well, yeah, the Second Amendment [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1194.1200000000001s)]
*  means gun silencers, guns, whatever you want. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1198.52s)]
*  Go bring them wherever. All good. All good. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1201.24s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1203.96s)]
*  One, there is a provision that eliminates [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1204.8s)]
*  attacks on gun silencers. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1208.88s)]
*  Now, this is a tax that has been on the books for about 100 years. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1211.76s)]
*  What? Why? Why are you suddenly cutting attacks on silencers? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1216.48s)]
*  Well, there was a there's a lot of thought and deliberation [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1219.92s)]
*  that went into that as well. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1221.8400000000001s)]
*  The Second Amendment is a critical freedom in the Constitution. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1222.8400000000001s)]
*  And there's no real rationale for silent for adding taxes [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1225.96s)]
*  on on these pieces of equipment. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1229.92s)]
*  And we had the votes to do it. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1232.16s)]
*  I think it was a long time overdue. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1234.0s)]
*  I think we have to protect the fundamental freedoms of the American people. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1235.5200000000002s)]
*  And there's there's no rationale [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1238.24s)]
*  the government should not be making money on something [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1239.8s)]
*  that you have a fundamental and a little right to. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1241.56s)]
*  What about? And then finally, you have the chief economic guy [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1244.2s)]
*  at the White House, Kevin Hassett, who's asked. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1248.28s)]
*  So are you what are we doing with the are the deals negotiating down [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1252.32s)]
*  the tariffs? Is that what you're doing? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1257.8799999999999s)]
*  What's the point of these? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1260.32s)]
*  And then Kevin has it's like tariffs aren't going away. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1261.56s)]
*  We're going to keep the tariffs. Play this clip. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1264.8799999999999s)]
*  You are saying tariffs are staying put. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1268.12s)]
*  That this is a constant source of reciprocal. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1271.04s)]
*  You've seen deals. Right. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1273.72s)]
*  But yes, I hear you. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1275.1599999999999s)]
*  Where they are, we're working it out and we're opening up markets. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1276.76s)]
*  You know, this is this is where I'm stuck, because deals [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1279.48s)]
*  is about negotiating down the tariffs. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1283.52s)]
*  So that's a diminishing source of revenue over time. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1286.3999999999999s)]
*  But are you saying that there will be blanket tariffs of last year? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1289.56s)]
*  What was that year before we got here? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1294.8s)]
*  We were raising 80 billion a year in tariffs. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1296.56s)]
*  Right now, the CBO projects that we're going to get two point [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1299.44s)]
*  eight trillion over the next 10 years. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1301.96s)]
*  Exactly where the number ends up is going to depend on how much [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1303.48s)]
*  foreign countries open up their markets to our products and how much [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1306.48s)]
*  how well they treat our farmers. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1310.1599999999999s)]
*  And you don't know how much revenue revenue was 80 billion last year. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1311.6799999999998s)]
*  Tariff revenues not going away. That's what I'm saying. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1316.28s)]
*  But we but we don't know what the tariffs are going to be. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1319.08s)]
*  We're negotiating them on a country by country basis. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1322.12s)]
*  We've got a bunch of trade deals. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1324.2s)]
*  We've got a trade deal with the UK that's all right. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1325.52s)]
*  You can see what the trade deal with the UK is now. Right. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1326.96s)]
*  So it's a fluctuating number. It's not a constant. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1329.36s)]
*  There you have it, folks. Ridiculous. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1332.4s)]
*  I don't know how you want these are the worst humans, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1335.0s)]
*  like just objectively the worst. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1337.56s)]
*  Objectively, these are the worst people like Ikeo. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1339.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't think you could find worse people. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1342.84s)]
*  We would be so much better with no one. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1345.08s)]
*  Just let the states go on like put Biden's [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1348.16s)]
*  economy and Biden stuff just in on [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wp3m8YlVQ&t=1351.96s)]
