# Trump KILLS HIS TERM with MAJOR BLUNDER in WAR
**MeidasTouch:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE)
*  The Middle East is burning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=0.0s)]
*  There's no peace in Ukraine. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=7.2s)]
*  Inflation is surging. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=9.4s)]
*  Donald Trump's trade war against the world is failing. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=11.5s)]
*  Donald Trump is federalizing National Guard troops and sending the National [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=15.0s)]
*  Guard and the Marines against United States citizens. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=20.64s)]
*  This is a dumpster fire presidency of the highest degree. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=24.04s)]
*  The video I showed you at the outset of this video, the clip I showed you, were [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=30.24s)]
*  fires continuing to burn in the Iranian capital of Tehran following new strikes [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=35.7s)]
*  by Israel in an all out war right now between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=41.8s)]
*  Israel began with preemptive attacks two days ago on Iranian nuclear sites and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=48.04s)]
*  residential buildings engaging in decapitation strikes against dozens of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=55.08s)]
*  Iranian military leaders and other leaders. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=60.28s)]
*  And then Iran retaliated against Israel attacking buildings in Israel and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=63.54s)]
*  causing significant damage as well. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=70.44s)]
*  Take a look right here of some of the footage of Iran's most recent strikes in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=73.44s)]
*  Tel Aviv you can see right here. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=79.14s)]
*  Again, all out war is now taking place here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=81.88s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=84.92s)]
*  As Brian Tyler Cohen, our friend says the quote, I'll lower cost and get us out of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=89.58s)]
*  endless wars candidate is now presiding over surging costs and brand new wars. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=95.48s)]
*  And Iran just issued the following warning as well, that they will be attacking [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=102.68s)]
*  military bases of any country that defends Israel. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=108.42s)]
*  Now, while all of that is going on, you have Donald Trump finishing up his final [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=113.48s)]
*  preparations for his dictator parade today, Donald Trump throwing a dictator [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=120.28s)]
*  Kim Jong Un style parade for himself. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  You can see the soldiers marching in this performance for him as Donald [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=129.58s)]
*  Trump has co-opted the 250th anniversary of our army and he's going to have the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=135.96s)]
*  tanks and the missiles and the howitzers all kind of march through Washington, D.C. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=142.26000000000002s)]
*  damage the city. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=147.56s)]
*  They claim it's only going to cost 45 million dollars. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=149.06s)]
*  I think it's going to cost nearly half a billion dollars. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=151.44s)]
*  I think they're hiding the costs. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=153.8s)]
*  But here's the final preparations of what it looks like. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=155.46s)]
*  Yes, what I'm showing you is not North Korea. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=158.3s)]
*  This is the United States. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  Here's Melania getting ready for the parade right there. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=165.96s)]
*  And here is Caitlyn Jenner, who's actually stuck in Tel Aviv right now in Israel. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=187.10000000000002s)]
*  I'm not sure why I'm showing those photos back to back like that, but whatever. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=194.66s)]
*  Here are, just take a look right here of what is the residential area in central [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=199.56s)]
*  Israel right here, and you can see the damage that's been caused by some of the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=205.64s)]
*  Iranian ballistic missiles that hit here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=210.24s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=212.8s)]
*  Yo, yo, yo, yo. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=213.56s)]
*  And by the way, no presidential address from Donald Trump, no statements, no clarity what's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=230.36s)]
*  taking place at all. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=236.24s)]
*  As our editor in chief Ron Filipkowski writes, can we at least get an update on how much [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=237.9s)]
*  the new proxy war is going to cost us while we're passing a bill with a record one [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=242.76s)]
*  trillion dollar defense budget without this and massive debt exploding deficits? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=248.16s)]
*  Our editor in chief Ron Filipkowski also writes, we're at war with Iran. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  Trump's gone into hiding. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=258.7s)]
*  Nobody will tell us our objectives, plan or end game. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=260.64s)]
*  Our secretary of defense is a useless dipshit. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=264.9s)]
*  Our secretary of state lied about it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  Our director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, loves the leader of Iran's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=270.36s)]
*  greatest ally, that would be Putin. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  And now we're having a parade for Donald Trump's birthday. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=277.2s)]
*  And you'll remember what went down on Thursday. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=281.0s)]
*  So on Thursday, Donald Trump made a social media post saying that the negotiations with [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=283.3s)]
*  Iran over a potential nuclear deal were productive. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  There was set to be discussions. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=294.7s)]
*  Another round, I think like the sixth round of nuclear discussions were set to take [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=296.84s)]
*  place on Sunday. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=300.96s)]
*  Marco Rubio reposted Donald Trump saying that he looks forward to productive negotiations. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=303.26s)]
*  Then we learned a few hours later that Israel began their preemptive strikes against [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=309.36s)]
*  nuclear facilities in Iran and the decapitation exercises killing all of these military [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=313.94s)]
*  leaders and other leaders in Iran. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=319.64s)]
*  Then Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, posted a statement saying the U.S. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=322.7s)]
*  has nothing to do with this. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=327.36s)]
*  This is the unilateral act of Israel. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  The United States is not involved at all. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=331.36s)]
*  Then we saw Israel putting out messages through their military saying, nope, the U.S. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=334.44s)]
*  was very much involved. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=339.66s)]
*  We couldn't have done this without the U.S. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=341.34000000000003s)]
*  The U.S. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=343.2s)]
*  helped every aspect of this. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=343.64s)]
*  They gave us the green light. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=345.44s)]
*  We're using U.S. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=346.76s)]
*  weapons. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=347.64s)]
*  We use their logistics. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=348.36s)]
*  And then it seemed on Thursday night into Friday morning that this was a very successful [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=350.68s)]
*  operation by Israel that killed a lot of the big bad guys in Iran. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  So Donald Trump got that message. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=360.14s)]
*  So then Donald Trump wanted to make himself like in his own mind, the central protagonist [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=362.18s)]
*  in this. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=367.98s)]
*  So he took credit as though he was the one who ordered the strikes. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=368.54s)]
*  So after Marco Rubio said the U.S. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=372.48s)]
*  had nothing to do with the war in Iran and the war breaking out in the Middle East, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=374.52s)]
*  Donald Trump's like, I did it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=379.62s)]
*  He makes this long post. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=381.21999999999997s)]
*  I gave Iran a chance, Iran a chance after chance to make a deal. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  I told them in the strongest words to just do it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=386.76s)]
*  But no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn't get [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=389.52s)]
*  it done. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=393.65999999999997s)]
*  I told them it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated or were told that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=394.02s)]
*  the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=399.36s)]
*  world by far and that Israel has a lot of it with much more to come and they know how [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=403.71999999999997s)]
*  to use it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=408.62s)]
*  But they didn't know what was about to happen. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=409.16s)]
*  They are all dead right now. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=411.32s)]
*  He says that the hardliners should have listened. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=414.22s)]
*  They are dead and it's going to get much worse. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=416.92s)]
*  And so Trump was trying to Trump was trying to act like a tough guy because Iran had not [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=420.1s)]
*  launched its retaliation. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=424.4s)]
*  And now Iran's launched its retaliation. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=425.82s)]
*  All hell is breaking loose. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=428.26s)]
*  And then Donald Trump went back into his bunker and all he wants to think about is his [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=429.96s)]
*  dictator parade. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=434.06s)]
*  By the way, here's Melania again and here is Caitlyn Jenner stuck in Tel Aviv right [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=435.03999999999996s)]
*  now. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=443.96s)]
*  I want to show you this too. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=444.64s)]
*  I get asked a lot just like the research tools that I use to find a lot of this stuff. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=445.84s)]
*  I use a research tool called ground news because I want to see stories like what's being [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=450.4s)]
*  covered by the right, what's being covered by the left, what's being covered by the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=454.79999999999995s)]
*  center. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=458.35999999999996s)]
*  So Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is urging Iranians to stand up and let [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=459.04s)]
*  their voices be heard and topple the Iranian regime. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, this is how delusional Netanyahu is. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=469.88s)]
*  He thinks that he's going to put out a statement to Iran and the people of Iran are going [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=471.88s)]
*  to be like, yes, Netanyahu, we're listening to you. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  But this is being fed to the right wing. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=479.08000000000004s)]
*  And so all the right wing people, you know, in all the right wing publications are sending [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=481.94s)]
*  this out to their people and they're giving like their readers and viewers hope that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=486.28s)]
*  like, I guess regime change is coming. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=490.67999999999995s)]

*  That's why it's important just to have, I think, the appropriate media diet and know [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=496.47999999999996s)]

*  So I use ground news to do that. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=503.67999999999995s)]
*  It's an essential service, at least in my view, for going, cutting through the double [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=505.35999999999996s)]
*  standards in the current media ecosphere. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=510.35999999999996s)]

*  I use a feature called blind spot. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=541.04s)]
*  So I say, what are they talking about on the right? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=543.4799999999999s)]
*  What are they talking about in the left? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=545.68s)]
*  Are there blind spots? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=547.12s)]
*  And that helps me craft these videos that I do. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=548.4799999999999s)]

*  All right. Back to the video here. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=560.0s)]
*  As Ryan Grimm points out, the U.S. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=562.04s)]
*  and Iran were scheduled to meet Sunday to continue nuclear talks. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=564.4399999999999s)]
*  Trump told Israel publicly and privately not to attack before the talks were over. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=568.0s)]
*  Israel clearly believes they can force the U.S. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=574.12s)]
*  into any war of their choosing. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=576.52s)]
*  And frankly, every country views Donald Trump as absolutely weak. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=578.68s)]
*  I mean, just on Friday, the following headlines we saw India and U.S. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=582.48s)]
*  are hardening their trade stance as July tariff deadline nears. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=588.16s)]
*  Remember, Trump said we're going to get we're very close to getting the India deal done. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=592.64s)]
*  Remember the videos I've been showing you about furious India pissed off at Donald Trump. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=596.76s)]
*  So you would have known by the way, I used ground news to get to this part of my research tools. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=601.16s)]
*  You would have known by watching us. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=605.64s)]
*  There's no deal in India happening anytime soon. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=607.24s)]
*  Same thing. You would have known no deal with Japan happening soon. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=610.12s)]
*  Here is the headline. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=613.48s)]
*  Japan and U.S. still far apart in tariff talks. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=614.52s)]
*  Prime Minister Aishiba is saying that the United States is basically not respecting Japan at all. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=617.76s)]
*  That shouldn't come as a surprise to you. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=624.04s)]
*  By the way, the United States has done zero deals in 90 days. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=626.24s)]
*  They didn't do a deal with UK. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=630.08s)]
*  It was a memorandum of understanding that literally says this is not a binding deal. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=631.6s)]
*  There's no deal with China. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=635.88s)]
*  It was a consensus and then a framework to implement the consensus [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=637.32s)]
*  where the U.S. cave and brought one hundred and forty five percent [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=641.5600000000001s)]
*  tariffs down to fifty five percent tariffs. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=645.08s)]
*  And then China basically said, we'll give you rare earth [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=647.5600000000001s)]
*  minerals that you were getting before, but only for a six month period. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=650.84s)]
*  And the U.S. was like, thank you. Thank you. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=654.28s)]
*  What a great deal we got. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=656.36s)]
*  Now we have a six month deadline of rare earth minerals. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=657.8s)]
*  And now we're taxing Americans fifty five percent. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=660.32s)]
*  It's like the stupidest negotiation ever that you can possibly imagine. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=663.16s)]
*  Oh, and then in between all of Donald Trump's like, you know, posts about [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=668.52s)]
*  I'm the one who gave Iran the deadlines. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=672.6800000000001s)]
*  I did this. I did this. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=674.76s)]
*  There's this photo. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=676.32s)]
*  This is the advertisement on Trump's social media platform. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=677.2s)]
*  It's an A.I. photo of Donald Trump wearing an orange jumpsuit. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=680.6800000000001s)]
*  And it says, innocent. Yes or no. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=684.44s)]
*  Tap to submit the poll. That's the ads they're doing. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=686.96s)]
*  I'm going to say no, he's not innocent, but just that's how he's grifting [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=690.0s)]
*  off of his supporters, putting himself in an orange jumpsuit. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=693.6400000000001s)]
*  You don't get more kind of grifty than that. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=697.4000000000001s)]
*  Tucker Carlson just came out with a statement saying Trump is complicit [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=700.5600000000001s)]
*  in the act of war. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=704.08s)]
*  U.S. should drop Israel. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=705.44s)]
*  That's what's coming out from Tucker Carlson. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=707.5200000000001s)]
*  And we're also learning John Favreau's writing, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=711.16s)]

*  Donald Trump's put up fencing around D.C. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K3pKVdKOE&t=734.52s)]
