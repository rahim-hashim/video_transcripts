# Trump gets HAUNTED BY PAST as his BASE QUITS on HIM
**MeidasTouch:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw)
*  As Donald Trump is bloodthirsty for war in the Middle East to prove that he's a tough guy, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=0.0s)]
*  while the entire world realizes how weak and utterly pathetic he is, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=6.96s)]
*  there's always a social media post or tweet from the past or video showing what a complete and utter fraud he is. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=12.4s)]
*  But that shouldn't shock you. He is a complete and utter phony and fraud. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=22.56s)]
*  Let's go back to the debates from the Republican presidential debates back in 2015-2016. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  Remember when Donald Trump said the following to Jeb Bush as the Tennessee holler says, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=36.32s)]
*  oh, maybe someone should show him these clips. Here, play this clip. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=42.32s)]
*  They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none. And they knew there [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=46.4s)]
*  were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction. Obviously, the war in Iraq [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=51.28s)]
*  was a big fat mistake. All right. Now, you can take it anywhere you want. And it took Jeb Bush, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=57.68s)]
*  if you remember at the beginning of his announcement when he announced the president, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=64.8s)]
*  took him five days. He went back. It was a mistake. It wasn't a mistake. It took him five days [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=68.24s)]
*  before his people told him what to say. And he ultimately said it was a mistake. The war in Iraq, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=73.76s)]
*  we spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives. We don't even have it. Iran is taking over Iraq with the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=80.0s)]
*  second largest oil reserves in the world. Obviously, it was a mistake. So George Bush [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=85.84s)]
*  made a mistake. We can make mistakes, but that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=91.2s)]
*  We have destabilized the Middle East. But so you so I mean, so you still think he should be impeached? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=96.56s)]
*  I think it's my turn. And you do whatever you want. You call it whatever you want. I want to tell you, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=101.92s)]
*  they lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none. And they knew there [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=106.16s)]
*  were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction. Okay. All right. Our team at the Midas Touch [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=111.12s)]
*  Network compiled this montage of clips showing that Donald Trump campaigned in 2024 and before as well [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=117.28s)]
*  on stopping endless wars. He would slam the Middle East conflicts and he would boast that he's the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=126.0s)]
*  one who would stop World War III. Play this clip. These globalists want to squander all of America's [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=133.68s)]
*  strength, blood and treasure, chasing monsters and phantoms overseas. In addition, there must also be [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=139.84s)]
*  a complete commitment to dismantling the entire globalist neocon establishment that is perpetually [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=148.24s)]
*  dragging us into endless wars, pretending to fight for freedom and democracy abroad. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  We should have never gone into the Middle East. We should have never gone into the Middle East. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  Under my leadership, we will turn the page forever on those foolish, stupid days of never-ending wars. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=166.4s)]
*  We're rebuilding our military stronger than ever before, and we are not going to deplete it again [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=174.0s)]
*  on stupid, senseless, endless wars. World War III has never been closer than it is right now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=180.0s)]
*  We need to clean house of all of the warmongers and America last globalist in the deep state, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=190.0s)]
*  I am the president who delivers peace. I was the first president in decades who didn't start a war, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  and the worst, most incompetent, most corrupt president in history is going to drag us into [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=202.64s)]
*  World War III. And this horrible, horrible president is dragging us toward World War III. We're going [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  to be in World War III soon. Because I think we would have been good with Iran. I don't want to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=215.68s)]
*  do anything bad to Iran. Large sections of the Middle East, I mean look at the death and destruction [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  that's taking place. And none of this would have happened if I were president. Our opponents join [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=225.44s)]
*  with warmongers and neocons to wage endless wars, these wars that never end. Together we're fighting [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=231.6s)]
*  to secure our borders, end the endless foreign wars, and defend the working people of America. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=238.8s)]
*  But the Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan and across the country want a stop to the endless [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=245.44s)]
*  wars and a return to peace in the Middle East. That's all they want. Speaking of World War III, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=251.36s)]
*  I'll keep you out of World War III. What would happen if we had a war? We won't with me, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=256.88s)]
*  but you will have World War III, I believe, without me, but we won't have. I will be sure [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=263.04s)]
*  that World War III will not happen. I'm the only one can say it won't happen. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=270.8s)]
*  But I stand here today and I'm the only candidate who can make this promise. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=275.12s)]
*  I will prevent and very easily World War III, very easily. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=283.12s)]
*  Again, there's always receipts and videos for everything. CNN put together this collection of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=289.68s)]
*  clips of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning that Iran was close to getting a nuclear [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=296.8s)]
*  weapon 24 hours a week. It's about to happen. Going back to 1996, we've been hearing this here, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=305.12s)]
*  playing this clip. The deadline for attaining this goal is getting extremely close. And Iran, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=314.32s)]
*  by the way, is also outpacing Iraq in the development of ballistic missile systems [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=320.88s)]
*  that they hope will reach the eastern seaboard of the United States within 15 years. By next [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=326.4s)]
*  spring at most by next summer at current enrichment rates, they will have finished [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=332.0s)]
*  the medium enrichment and move on to the final stage. From there, it's only a few months, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=338.72s)]
*  possibly a few weeks before they get enough enriched uranium for the first bomb. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=345.76s)]
*  The foremost sponsor of global terrorism could be weeks away from having enough enriched uranium [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=352.72s)]
*  for an entire arsenal of nuclear weapons that would place a militant Islamic terror regime [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=360.4s)]
*  weeks away from having the fissile material for an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=367.28s)]
*  If not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be a year. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  It could be within a few months, less than a year. You know, and what 90 days ago, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, Trump's DNI, she said, according [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=385.68s)]
*  to the U.S. intelligence community, this was 90 days ago, she said that Iran is not capable [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=393.76000000000005s)]
*  of building a nuclear weapon and they're not pursuing a nuclear weapons program. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=400.56s)]
*  This is what she said here, playing this clip. The IC continues to assess that Iran is not building [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=404.24s)]
*  a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=409.04s)]
*  that he suspended in 2003. The IC continues to monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=414.08s)]
*  its nuclear weapons program. Now, I want to be clear about what my position is. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=421.2s)]
*  I do not want Iran to get a nuclear weapon. Okay. I do not think that the Ayatollah should be leading [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=426.64s)]
*  Iran. I also recognize that regime change means bloody civil war and that, my view, American [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=434.8s)]
*  troops should not be sent into the Middle East to be a part of a bloody civil war in Iran [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=444.88s)]
*  or a war in Iran at all. Donald Trump has alienated our allies at the G7. He basically gave them the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  middle finger. The only, I guess, ally that Donald Trump has now is Netanyahu and for just the U.S. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=459.28s)]
*  and Israel to go it alone, pursue regime change, which can lead to regional destabilization, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=467.44s)]
*  committing potentially American troops to an endless war in the Middle East without a plan. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=475.44s)]
*  I mean, just think about what will happen in Iran. Let's just say you topple the Ayatollah. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  Everyone, no one likes the Ayatollah, okay? I mean, I look at those videos and photographs [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=486.48s)]
*  in the 70s before the revolution and you see women's rights, you see people out there, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=492.8s)]
*  looked like a modern society in the 70s before it became a theocracy. But play it out. So we already [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=499.52000000000004s)]
*  have the family and the descendants of the Shah saying they want to take over. You have [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  extreme terroristic groups, even more extreme than the Ayatollah, who would want to take over Iran [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=513.52s)]
*  in a power vacuum. The people of Iran, in my opinion, are not going to be okay with Benjamin [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=520.72s)]
*  Netanyahu or Trump picking a puppet ruler to lead or picking whoever their ruler is to lead Iran. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=527.6s)]
*  So play it out what happens here. Play it out what happens. And if we're not reaching out to our [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=535.36s)]
*  typical G7 allies, what the hell do you think is going to happen? Wow, it wasn't supposed to get [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=542.16s)]
*  this bad. You were on top of your bills, then inflation hit, groceries, gas, everything went up. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=547.76s)]
*  Prices are up 26% from just a few years ago. 26%. It's not your fault you've fallen into debt. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=554.8s)]
*  Let me share a smarter, faster, and far easier way out of debt. It's called done with debt. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=563.36s)]
*  And they're not like other debt relief companies. They don't push loans or bankruptcy on you. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=570.72s)]
*  Done with debt are legendary negotiators who go head to head with your credit card and loan [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=576.88s)]
*  companies. They have one goal to drastically reduce or eliminate your debt altogether. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=582.72s)]
*  And unlike those others, done with debt moves lightning fast. Most clients see more money in [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=590.5600000000001s)]
*  their pocket month one. But a word to the wise, hurry, because some of their brilliant debt [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=597.36s)]
*  erasing strategies are time sensitive. Do not make another bill payment until you talk to a [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=603.52s)]
*  done with debt strategist. It's free. Visit donewithdebt.com. That's donewithdebt.com. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=610.88s)]
*  Donewithdebt.com. But by the way, as the Tennessee Holler account points out, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=621.04s)]
*  it's not just Netanyahu. The New York Times has been warning of a nuclear Iran for 30 years also. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=626.64s)]
*  Now, as I've said before, I don't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon, period, full stop. But [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=633.76s)]
*  I want to make sure we're getting accurate info and we're not getting played like the WMDs in Iraq. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=638.64s)]
*  And this is going to be Iraq, you know, times 10. Here, play this clip. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=645.5200000000001s)]
*  So Donald Trump was asked when he was flying back from the G7 because he was too cowardly to spend [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=716.08s)]
*  Tuesday to be with President Zelensky. Trump was asked, your own director of National Intelligence [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=740.0s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard testified in March that Iran was not building nuclear weapons. And Trump's response [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=745.92s)]
*  was, I don't care what she's saying. Play this clip. But how close do you personally think that [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=753.92s)]
*  they were to getting one because Tulsi Gabbard testified in March that the intelligence community [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=760.16s)]
*  said Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon. I don't care what she said. I think that we're [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=766.24s)]
*  very close to having one. The IC continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=770.0s)]
*  and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=775.04s)]
*  Or Donald, maybe you want to watch this video of yourself when Obama was in office when you said, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=781.12s)]
*  our president will start a war with Iran because he's so stupid. Here, play this clip. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=787.1999999999999s)]
*  Our president will start a war with Iran because he has absolutely no ability to negotiate. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=791.92s)]
*  He's weak and he's ineffective. And now you have Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=798.88s)]
*  basically saying it's Trump and Fox propaganda that's pushing for the US to get involved in a [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=804.24s)]
*  war in Iran. Let's play it. It does feel like Fox News is playing, and I never criticized Fox [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=809.84s)]
*  because they were so kind to me, but they are playing a central role in the propaganda [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=817.6800000000001s)]
*  operation here. It feels like. Let's go back to the Iraq War. I mean, you were there, you saw it. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=823.28s)]
*  Look at the Iraq War. I promoted the Iraq War. When knowingly, because of the information you [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=830.24s)]
*  were giving knowingly what they did, if you go back to look at Iraq, it's not like these things [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=834.16s)]
*  are successful. They're not successful. They're unsuccessful. They can't be successful because, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=838.24s)]
*  as Lincoln told us, what you need is popular opinion to have your back. And we don't do [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=843.28s)]
*  enough about educating the American people on what reality is. In fact, they give them the exact [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=848.8s)]
*  opposite. That's why it's all that's what this is. The rise of Trump is from two things. The rise of [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=852.72s)]
*  Trump is from the failed Iraq War and from the 2008 financial collapse. You had Buchanan before [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=857.44s)]
*  that. We had Perot before that. We had even Reagan from some populism national. You had these [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=864.0s)]
*  sprouts. You could see people were trying to get there, but they couldn't. It was those two [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=868.8000000000001s)]
*  cataclysmic events, right? An epic failed war, right? That we were lied to about everything. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=873.12s)]
*  The reason we went in, because remember, first the American people supported it, given the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=879.36s)]
*  information they were given. Then later they realized that, hey, not just with the initial [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=882.72s)]
*  predicate for this a lie, all the updates were kind of a lie, right? All the updates were a lie. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=887.76s)]
*  We really weren't winning, right? Until we sent General Kelly to the Anbar province to be the [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=892.8000000000001s)]
*  toughest tribe, it was, and it took forever. And what, 8,000 dead, 50,000 wounded, $9 trillion, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=897.84s)]
*  two trillion, or seven trillion in Iraq and two trillion in Afghanistan. You're just lied about [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=904.96s)]
*  the entire time. That's what's happening here. And I thought this was a powerful speech by [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=910.56s)]
*  Democratic Senator Tim Kaine. Here's what he said. The Constitution says the power to declare war [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=914.64s)]
*  is Congress. Play this clip. There's no part of the Constitution that's more important [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=921.04s)]
*  than the Article One provisions making plain that the United States should not be at war without a [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=926.0s)]
*  vote of Congress. And yet the news of the day suggests that we are potentially on the verge [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=931.76s)]
*  of a war with Iran. When I was elected to the Senate in 2012, having served as a governor from [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=939.6s)]
*  2006 to 2010 during a tremendous upsurge in the two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=948.4s)]
*  I visited our troops multiple times in the Green Zone and Baghdad and in Afghanistan. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=956.24s)]
*  I went to the deployments and the homecomings. I went to the wakes and the funerals. And I told [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=963.92s)]
*  myself when I came to the Senate that if I ever had the chance to stop this nation from getting [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=970.08s)]
*  into an unnecessary war, I would do everything I could to stop us from getting into an unnecessary [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=977.12s)]
*  war. I happen to believe that the United States engaging in a war against Iran, a third war in [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=985.28s)]
*  the Middle East since 2001, would be a catastrophic blunder for this country. I think there are some [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=991.52s)]
*  in this body who have a different point of view than me on that point, but I think we should all [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=1000.72s)]
*  be able to agree that the fundamental constitutional principle that says we shouldn't be in a war [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=1006.96s)]
*  if Congress doesn't have the guts to debate it and vote on it, we should all, having taken an oath [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=1014.0s)]
*  to the Constitution, at least support the principle that war is something that should be for Congress [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=1022.8s)]
*  to declare. Or Democratic Senator Murphy from Connecticut. Here's what he's got to say. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=1030.1599999999999s)]
*  Anyone who is cheerleading the United States into a war with Iran has very quickly forgotten [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=1034.56s)]
*  the disasters of the Iraq war and the Afghanistan war, where there were early tactical successes, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=1040.16s)]
*  but it became a quagmire that ultimately got thousands of Americans killed, created new [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=1045.68s)]
*  insurgencies against U.S. interests and against our allies in the region. So I do not think there's [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=1050.96s)]
*  support in this country for the United States to go to war again in the Middle East. And I would [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=1056.4s)]
*  remind the President that he can't take any offensive action against Iran without coming [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=1060.64s)]
*  to Congress first. He has no leeway here. The Constitution requires him to get an authorization [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=1066.64s)]
*  of military force from Congress. I don't think that he'll get that authorization from this Congress [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=1070.88s)]
*  because there is opposition on both the Republican and Democratic side to the United States getting [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=1075.5200000000002s)]
*  dragged into another potentially disastrous conflict in the Middle East. So as I said, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=1079.6000000000001s)]
*  there is a social media post or tweet for everything regarding Donald Trump, but I want [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZgP1-TuMXw&t=1084.48s)]
