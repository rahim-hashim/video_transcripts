**MeidasTouch:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY)
*  A war has just broken out between India and Pakistan as India struck targets in an area [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=0.0s)]
*  in Kashmir controlled by Pakistan. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=14.68s)]
*  What is Donald Trump doing while that was taking place? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=17.42s)]
*  He was holding a 2026 World Cup planning task force that was one of the most bizarre press [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=20.66s)]
*  events I've ever seen. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  Just take a look at what the newswire was saying. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=31.36s)]
*  You had the newswire saying, Pakistan will respond to attacks by India military says. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=34.48s)]
*  India army says justice is served after strikes on sites in Pakistan. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=39.76s)]
*  Donald Trump says, I don't know if I'm supposed to say soccer or football. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=44.6s)]
*  Pakistan begins process of retaliation against India strikes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=49.4s)]
*  That's what's going on. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=53.64s)]
*  And Donald Trump says the following. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=54.64s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=56.239999999999995s)]
*  We can't wait to welcome soccer fans from all over the globe. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=57.24s)]
*  I don't know if I'm supposed to say soccer or football, because every time I say soccer, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=61.52s)]
*  Baron and Eric say you're really saying it wrong. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=66.04s)]
*  It's supposed to be football, but we know it more as soccer. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=69.64s)]
*  And then Donald Trump at this bizarre press conference asks Rudy Giuliani's kid, who's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  one of the leaders of the 2026 World Cup task force. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=79.76s)]
*  Trump asks Giuliani's kid. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=84.68s)]
*  If my golf game is good, he goes, tell everyone I'm a good golfer. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  Tell everyone I'm a good golfer here playing this clip. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=90.12s)]
*  And our executive director, Andrew Giuliani, just got the post and he's going to be great. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=93.0s)]
*  I know him for a long time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=97.72s)]
*  He's a he's a highly competitive golfer, which I mean, really good. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=98.84s)]
*  And he's also a highly competitive person and he loves what we're doing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=104.2s)]
*  So I want to congratulate you and your family and your father, your great father, who's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=107.76s)]
*  the greatest mayor in the history of New York. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=112.84s)]
*  So I want to congratulate the family. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=114.8s)]
*  It's a big it's a big post. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  You better do well, Andrew. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=119.32s)]
*  Tell him, is my golf game OK, too? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=122.24s)]
*  He knew what to say. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=125.56s)]
*  See, he's a smart person. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=126.48s)]
*  That's why I appointed him. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=128.84s)]
*  Then Trump gets upset that Russia has been removed from the G8 [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=130.52s)]
*  for quite some time, Donald. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=136.04s)]
*  That should never have happened. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=138.4s)]
*  That should never have happened. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=139.52s)]
*  That's what you're talking about. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=140.6s)]
*  While a war has just broken out between India and Pakistan. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=142.28s)]
*  Play this clip going on right now. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=146.56s)]
*  I thought it was a very bad decision. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  It was headed by Trudeau, by the way, and Obama. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=149.8s)]
*  They were the ones that really fought hard to get Russia out. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=153.84s)]
*  I think of Russia were in you wouldn't be they threw him out. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=156.52s)]
*  And because of that, maybe [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=160.56s)]
*  millions of people are dying, millions, you know, millions. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=164.68s)]
*  The numbers are far greater than you think. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=167.88s)]
*  But millions of people are dying. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=170.48s)]
*  If he was sitting around the table with other people, seven people [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=173.16s)]
*  hammering him and saying, let's not do this, you would. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=176.6s)]
*  I think you wouldn't probably have had the problems that you've had. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, didn't Donald Trump say that he would end the war in Ukraine [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  in 24 hours, that he would end the war in Gaza in 24 hours [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=188.2s)]
*  and he would bring peace to Gaza in 24. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=192.76s)]
*  Remember, you said that peace, he promised. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=194.6s)]
*  Remember, Donald Trump said that no wars would start. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=196.6s)]
*  Well, there you have it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump then gets upset when he finds out that Russia [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=201.88s)]
*  has been banned from playing in the World Cup. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=205.24s)]
*  He's like, I didn't know that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=207.64s)]
*  I just found that out to your play this clip. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=209.0s)]
*  It's going to be very strong. Thank you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=210.88s)]
*  Yes. Russia is banned from playing the next World Cup. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=214.16s)]
*  What's your position on this? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=218.84s)]
*  Say it again. Russia has been banned from playing the next World Cup. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  What's your position? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  I didn't know that. Is that right? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=225.56s)]
*  Yeah, that is right. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=227.84s)]
*  They are banned for the time being from playing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=229.16s)]
*  But we hope that he's the boss. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=231.84s)]
*  I'm not the boss on that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  We hope that something happens and peace will happen. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  And then we can be readmitted. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=238.4s)]
*  So that's what we hope. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=240.68s)]
*  Hey, that could be a good incentive. Right. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=242.84s)]
*  We want to get them to stop. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=244.8s)]
*  We want them to stop. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=246.52s)]
*  We want the 5000 young people a week are being killed. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=247.72s)]
*  It's not even believable. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=253.96s)]
*  Then you have J.D. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  Vance threatening tourists who show up in the United States to watch the World Cup in 2026. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=256.88s)]
*  And J.D. Vance says you better leave when you're supposed to go or else [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=263.72s)]
*  Kristi Noem, the secretary, Noem is going to come after you. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=267.88s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=271.48s)]
*  And I know we'll have visitors probably from close to 100 countries. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=272.2s)]
*  We want them to come. We want them to celebrate. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  We want them to watch the game. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=277.64s)]
*  But when the time is up, they'll have to go home. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=279.16s)]
*  Otherwise, they'll have to talk to secretary now who I'll turn it over to now. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=282.16s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=288.44s)]
*  Thank you so much for. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=289.56s)]
*  Oh, that's very funny. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=291.76000000000005s)]
*  You're threatening people. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=292.64000000000004s)]
*  They're going to end up in concentration camps in El Salvador. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  Ha ha ha. When you're actually disappearing human beings and you're putting tourists [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=296.8s)]
*  in detention centers, when you're taking tourists and basically treating them [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=301.24s)]
*  like criminals and you've destroyed tourism into the United States, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=305.24s)]
*  that's you. You find that funny. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=310.24s)]
*  I mean, these people are sick, demented people. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=312.44s)]
*  Speaking of Kristi Noem dog killer, Homeland Security Secretary [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  shows that this regime is basically just like Kim Jong-un. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=319.12s)]
*  Thank you. You're making everyone's dreams come true. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=322.56s)]
*  Mr. President. Here, play this clip. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=325.32s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=327.32s)]
*  Thank you so much for [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=328.48s)]
*  dreaming big dreams and doing unprecedented things your entire life. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=331.0s)]
*  You have stood for doing things that other people thought they couldn't do [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=334.4s)]
*  and accomplishing unprecedented events and achievements. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=337.72s)]
*  And so this is one of those events that I think is going to be remarkable [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=342.04s)]
*  and will stand the test of time as the world's greatest sporting event [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=345.44s)]
*  ever held and conducted. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=349.2s)]
*  You are honoring us by agreeing to be the chairman of this event. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=351.12s)]
*  Then Donald Trump reflects on his disastrous press conference [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=353.88s)]
*  with Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney earlier in the day, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=358.12s)]
*  where Prime Minister Carney went elbows up, stood up to Donald Trump [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=361.76s)]
*  and said, not now, not ever. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=365.56s)]
*  Canada will never be a 51st state. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=367.36s)]
*  And Donald Trump was like, maybe, maybe, maybe. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=370.0s)]
*  And Prime Minister Carney is like, never, never. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=372.36s)]
*  So now Donald Trump, again, while a war is taking place in India and Pakistan, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=374.64s)]
*  Donald Trump is like, should I call him? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=380.12s)]
*  I've never called him Governor Carney. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=382.48s)]
*  Should I call him Governor Carney? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=384.8s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  For people with that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=387.76s)]
*  But I give a very long definition this morning in the Oval Office. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=388.56s)]
*  We have we're in very, very good shape. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=392.6s)]
*  This country has never been in better shape. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=395.08s)]
*  And we're doing great. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=396.88s)]
*  We were being ripped off by every country in the world virtually. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=399.68s)]
*  And now we're not being ripped off anymore. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=403.88s)]
*  It's very simple. Very, very simple. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=405.64s)]
*  As far as calling him Governor Carney now, I haven't done that yet. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=407.36s)]
*  And maybe I won't. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=411.28s)]
*  I did have a lot of fun with Trudeau. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=412.96s)]
*  But I think this is this is a big step up. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=416.36s)]
*  So I've been drinking way less lately because the fallout for me the next day [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=419.32s)]
*  just seems to get horses. I get older. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=422.64s)]
*  But sometimes I still want to kick back without the hangover or that bloated feeling. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=424.48s)]
*  That's why I'm psyched. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=428.24s)]
*  I found out about Sol's out of office THC beverages. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=429.24s)]
*  They've been a great low calorie, gluten free alternative, and they don't cause hangovers. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=432.76s)]
*  You probably heard me rave about their out of office gummies. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=436.92s)]
*  But now they've launched something even better. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=439.40000000000003s)]
*  Out of office THC beverages, and they are exactly what I've been missing. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=441.56s)]
*  I cracked open a raspberry lemonade last night, felt like I was sipping summertime in a can. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=446.20000000000005s)]
*  It's this perfect little microdose of THC and CBD. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=451.44s)]
*  That gives you that chill, euphoric feeling. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  No hangover, no regrets. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=456.36s)]
*  And the flavors raspberry lemonade and cucumber melon lime. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=458.24s)]
*  Total crowd pleasers. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=461.68s)]
*  Plus, you get to pick your dose two and a half milligrams or five milligrams THC [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=462.96s)]
*  in six, 12 or 24 packs. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  So you could ease into your vibe your way. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=470.2s)]
*  Sol's drinks have become a go to in my house. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=473.04s)]
*  They've really helped me chill out after a crazy day. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=475.96s)]
*  And you know, I have a lot of those. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=478.16s)]
*  And I love the company's emphasis on health and wellness. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=479.56s)]
*  By the way, shout out to the founders, Mike and Angie Lee, a former pro boxer and a wellness [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=482.72s)]
*  speaker who built Sol to offer natural alternatives to stress, sleep, focus, you name it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=487.36s)]
*  The Midas Touch Network is a sibling run business. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=492.64s)]
*  So I love seeing siblings doing great work in other spaces. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  So if you want to feel your best, head to getsol.com and use code Midas for 30% off your order. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=498.0s)]
*  That's 30% off your order using code Midas. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=503.56s)]
*  One last time, getsol.com and code Midas, M-E-I-D-A-S for 30% off. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=506.28s)]
*  So then finally, finally, Donald Trump says something about the attacks between India [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=512.84s)]
*  and Pakistan and Donald Trump's responses. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=519.92s)]
*  It's a shame. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=522.64s)]
*  I hope it ends soon. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=524.28s)]
*  It's a shame. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=525.4s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=526.4399999999999s)]
*  Any questions for Steve? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=527.72s)]
*  No, it's a shame. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=534.48s)]
*  We just heard about it just as we were walking in the doors of the oval. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=535.2s)]
*  Just heard about it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=539.84s)]
*  I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=541.36s)]
*  They've been fighting for a long time. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=545.72s)]
*  You know, they've been fighting for many, many decades and centuries, actually, if you [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=547.2s)]
*  really think about it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=553.24s)]
*  No, I just hope it ends very quickly. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=554.9200000000001s)]
*  That's your response. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=557.6s)]
*  It's a shame. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=558.6s)]
*  No, maybe make phone calls, maybe reach out to NATO. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=559.88s)]
*  Oh, wait a minute. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=563.96s)]
*  You've alienated all your allies. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=565.16s)]
*  You've alienated the world's community. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=567.7199999999999s)]
*  You've created such instability that India's even going about this because they think [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=569.9599999999999s)]
*  that there's nothing that you're going to do to retaliate against them. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=576.4399999999999s)]
*  So you've basically shown complete and utter weakness and capitulation around the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=579.68s)]
*  world. By the way, that statement's the weakest thing ever as well. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=584.28s)]
*  Then Donald Trump is asked, so why haven't you done any deals yet? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=587.3199999999999s)]
*  And Donald Trump's like, I could announce any deal. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=590.4s)]
*  I could announce 100 deals tomorrow. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=592.48s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=594.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=595.76s)]
*  Well, I can announce all of them now. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=601.0799999999999s)]
*  I could announce 50 to 100 deals right now because, you know, I'm the shopkeeper and I [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=602.8399999999999s)]
*  keep the store and, you know, I know what countries are looking for and I know what [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=608.12s)]
*  we're looking for. And I can just set those terms and they can go shopping or they don't [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=613.28s)]
*  have to go shopping because everybody wants to shop here. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=617.6s)]
*  This is like a beautiful store. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=620.68s)]
*  This is like one of Bernard Arnaud. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=622.28s)]
*  Maybe I should say Alex, even more importantly, young the future. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=626.0799999999999s)]
*  You got more Donald Trump attacking New York attorney general Letitia James. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=629.76s)]
*  I don't randomly play this clip. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=633.48s)]
*  Perhaps the attorney general, the Justice Department recently received a criminal [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=637.8s)]
*  referral against New York attorney general Letitia James for fraud. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=642.16s)]
*  We haven't heard much about it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=645.72s)]
*  You or the attorney general, give us an update as to what's going on with that [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=647.28s)]
*  investigation. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=650.36s)]
*  Well, I don't want to get involved in something that Pamela is involved with. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=651.44s)]
*  If you'd like to say something, Pam. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=655.92s)]
*  I can say unrelated to that. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=661.64s)]
*  She's a disaster for New York. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=663.2s)]
*  She's a horrible, horrible human being. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=665.24s)]
*  And I think she's a total crook. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=667.92s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=669.28s)]
*  But that's just my opinion. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=670.32s)]
*  Pam's going to have to do what she wants. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=671.44s)]
*  She's a very bad person. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=672.88s)]
*  She's a very, very, very bad person who campaigned solely on I'm going to get [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=674.52s)]
*  Donald Trump over and over again. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=679.48s)]
*  She's a sick person, but that's has nothing to do with what Pam does. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=681.76s)]
*  Pam is going to do what's right. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=686.64s)]
*  She always does. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=688.2s)]
*  I've known Donald Trump and talks about he's asked a question about progress as [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=689.28s)]
*  it relates to Russia and peace in Ukraine. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=695.08s)]
*  And then Donald Trump's now like metric. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=700.48s)]
*  He's like, I did it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=703.2s)]
*  I solved it. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=704.12s)]
*  Russia would have taken over Ukraine, but I stopped him. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=705.32s)]
*  No, no, you didn't. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=708.2s)]
*  You didn't do anything at all, but this is Donald Trump's new view. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=709.44s)]
*  We won. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=713.32s)]
*  I did what I said I was going to do. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=714.5600000000001s)]
*  They are, they are stopped. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=716.24s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=717.92s)]
*  To travel once again to Russia. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=721.36s)]
*  And as you mentioned in your remarks, he's traveled to Russia on a number of [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=724.04s)]
*  occasions, he's met with president Putin. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=729.5600000000001s)]
*  What type of progress is being made as it relates to all of those visits that [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=732.28s)]
*  he's made to Russia? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=737.16s)]
*  I think a lot because I think Russia wanted to take all of Ukraine and they've [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=738.76s)]
*  stopped. That's a lot of progress, you know, small. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=741.88s)]
*  It's a portion of Ukraine, but no, I think a lot. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=746.5600000000001s)]
*  I think if we weren't here, they would be right now fighting to take the whole [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=749.24s)]
*  country and they're not doing that. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=753.96s)]
*  So I think that's a lot of progress. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=756.16s)]
*  Mr. President, please. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=758.16s)]
*  So utterly deranged, so utterly deranged folks. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuYDDLYmioY&t=759.72s)]
