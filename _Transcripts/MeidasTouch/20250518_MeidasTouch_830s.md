# FURIOUS India BLASTS Trump for SCREWING THEM
**MeidasTouch:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU)
*  India is furious at the Trump regime right now. This is not being reported at all by American media, but it is being reported in India. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=0.0s)]
*  Let me explain to you why India is furious. There's three main reasons. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=10.44s)]
*  Number one, Donald Trump was taking credit for brokering the ceasefire between India and Pakistan after the terrorist attacks in Kashmir. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  India is saying Trump had nothing to do with it at all. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=25.36s)]
*  It's strictly bilateral discussions between India and Pakistan, and India is saying by Donald Trump pretending that he got involved in it, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=28.48s)]
*  it actually makes India look weak when India said, we negotiated this on our own based on the strength of the Indian military. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=37.64s)]
*  Stop interfering, Donald Trump. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=45.68s)]
*  Another reason is that Donald Trump's been misrepresenting that he has some trade deal with India that hasn't taken place, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=47.84s)]
*  and Trump said that he basically used trade as a carrot to broker a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=56.36s)]
*  And again, that makes India look weak, and India is saying that's not true. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=64.88s)]
*  We don't have a deal. We're only going to do a deal that's in the interest of India. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=69.16s)]
*  Stop lying about our negotiations and our discussions. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=73.92s)]
*  And along those lines as well, remember, Donald Trump attacked Apple, the company Apple, for saying it was going to move factories to India [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=78.92s)]
*  because Donald Trump said that that was an end run around his tariffs against China. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=89.44s)]
*  He said he called Tim Cook and said, don't build factories in India. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=94.92s)]
*  So India is like, why the hell are you telling Apple not to develop factories in India? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=99.04s)]
*  That's screwed up. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=104.92s)]
*  And then finally, the third reason why India is absolutely pissed, and there's deeper levels of complexity here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  I'm overgeneralizing it, is that the Trump family seems to have done a crypto deal with Pakistan and with the Pakistan government. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  And Indian officials are basically saying, is Donald Trump going to be changing his policies toward India? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=122.76s)]
*  Is Donald Trump engaging in behavior that's pissing off the country of India right now [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  because Trump's family, which has a 60% stake in this WLFI, this World Liberty Financial Company, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=134.88s)]
*  is that why Donald Trump's position with India has changed? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  So let's break down all three of these things. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  And why don't we bring you directly some great reporting from India itself? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=151.48s)]
*  And then we'll break down this kind of one by one. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  I want to give a shout out here to Vantage Media, this show Vantage with Palki Sharma. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=159.76s)]
*  They do a really good job here. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=166.32s)]
*  And in this first clip I want to show you from the show, they talk about how this is India's external affairs minister [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=168.48s)]
*  saying that the negotiations regarding ceasefire between India and Pakistan is being handled on a bilateral basis. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=177.76s)]
*  And this host, by the way, Palki Sharma, is incredible. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=185.48s)]
*  I mean, I think that she's a very strong host, you know, at least here. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=190.0s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  The amount of ignorance out there. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=193.95999999999998s)]
*  Like we've said before, the Kashmir issue is not thousands of years old. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=197.0s)]
*  It dates back to 1947. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=201.0s)]
*  Also, what's this obsession with trade? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=204.64s)]
*  Kashmir is a deeply emotional issue for India and Pakistan. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=206.64s)]
*  You think they would settle it over trade? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  Pakistan may need the money, but India is under no such pressure. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=213.11999999999998s)]
*  Today, Foreign Minister S.J. Shankar made India's position clear. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=216.6s)]
*  All dealings with Pakistan will be bilateral. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=220.2s)]
*  Our relations, our dealings with them will be bilateral and strictly bilateral. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=223.76s)]
*  That is a national consensus for many years. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=230.16s)]
*  And there is absolutely no change in that consensus that dealings with Pakistan will be bilateral. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=233.56s)]
*  Now, here this host, Palki Sharma, as well, then talks about Donald Trump misrepresenting the trade deals with India. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  Let me show you this clip right here. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  And then she also cites the external affairs minister as well. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=251.68s)]
*  Let me play this clip right here. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=256.64s)]
*  Trump, he won't. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=258.12s)]
*  He is known for making such wild unilateral claims. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=259.96s)]
*  Take trade, for example. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=263.56s)]
*  Trump says India is offering zero tariffs to America, basically no tariffs on US imports. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=265.12s)]
*  Just one problem, though. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  India has not announced any such move or offer. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=272.08s)]
*  Again, the clarification came from Minister S.J. Shankar. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=276.12s)]
*  Any trade deal, any trade deal has to be mutually beneficial. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=279.88s)]
*  Any trade deal has to work for both the countries. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=284.92s)]
*  And I think that would be our expectation from the trade deal. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  And until that is done, I think any judgment on it would be premature. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=294.56s)]
*  India says any judgment would be premature, but that is not stopping Trump. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=301.48s)]
*  He's also threatening companies against making in India companies like Apple. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=305.32s)]
*  Apple was thinking about setting up factories in India. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=310.20000000000005s)]
*  Trump's tariffs made China unsustainable. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=313.44s)]
*  So Apple thought, why not make in India? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=316.2s)]
*  But US President Donald Trump says he will not allow it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=319.32s)]
*  I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=324.12s)]
*  I said to him, Tim, you're my friend. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=326.32s)]
*  I treated you very good. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=327.76s)]
*  You're coming in with 500 billion dollars, but now I hear you're building all over India. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=328.8s)]
*  I don't want you building in India. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=332.36s)]
*  You can build in India if you want to take care of India, because India is the highest, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=333.64s)]
*  one of the highest tariff nations in the world. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=339.24s)]
*  It's very hard to sell into India. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=342.4s)]
*  In baseball, there are three strikes. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=346.2s)]
*  Trump has used them up in just one week. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=348.52s)]
*  First, he claimed credit for ending the fighting between India and Pakistan. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=351.56s)]
*  Then he unilaterally claimed zero tariffs from India. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=356.64s)]
*  Then he warned Apple against making in India. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=359.88s)]
*  And now we get news of his family striking a deal with Pakistan, which brings me back [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=362.52s)]
*  to my original question. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=366.88s)]
*  Whose side is Donald Trump on? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=368.64s)]
*  Personally, we know he's on the side of money. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=371.47999999999996s)]
*  Now, here's what DW News has to say about these tensions between Trump and Modi right [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  now and why India is so furious. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=380.59999999999997s)]
*  It's along the lines of what I was saying, but here, play this clip. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=382.84s)]
*  Trump has claimed the role as dealmaker in chief after the two nuclear armed neighbors [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=385.44s)]
*  came dangerously close to war when they struck each other with missiles, drones and heavy [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  artillery for four days. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=396.08s)]
*  So what exactly did Trump say that's raffled feathers here in Delhi? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=398.36s)]
*  Let's stop it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=402.12s)]
*  Let's stop it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=403.12s)]
*  If you stop it, we're doing trade. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=404.12s)]
*  If you don't stop it, we're not going to do any trade. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=406.52000000000004s)]
*  People have never really used trade the way I used it, that I can tell you. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  And all of a sudden they said, I think we're going to stop. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=413.6s)]
*  And they have. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=417.0s)]
*  And Trump didn't stop there. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=418.0s)]
*  He even claimed he prevented a nuclear war. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=419.36s)]
*  I think it could have been a bad nuclear war. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=422.28000000000003s)]
*  Millions of people could have been killed. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=426.2s)]
*  So I'm very proud of that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  That's definitely not how India tells it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=429.08s)]
*  Modi's government says it was Indian firepower that forced Pakistan to ask for a ceasefire [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=431.8s)]
*  on May 10. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=437.4s)]
*  Just to be clear, India has confirmed getting calls from US Vice President J.D. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=456.12s)]
*  Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio right before the ceasefire. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=468.2s)]
*  But while Pakistan later thanked Donald Trump for the truce, India doesn't acknowledge [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=473.4s)]
*  any US role. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=477.92s)]
*  It's also pushed back on Trump's claim that trade even came up. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=479.56s)]
*  Instead, Delhi says it won't fall for what Prime Minister Modi called nuclear blackmail [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=483.48s)]
*  from Pakistan. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=488.76s)]
*  And it's sticking to this one line. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=490.20000000000005s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=492.56s)]
*  It was the force of Indian arms that compelled Pakistan to stop its firing. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=494.56s)]
*  Now let me show you what World Life Liberty posted about their deal with Pakistan's crypto [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=500.6s)]
*  council. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=507.32s)]
*  This is from April 28, 2025. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=508.56s)]
*  So about six days after the terrorist attack in Kashmir, here's what WLFI posted. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=511.96s)]
*  Historic moment. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=517.24s)]
*  WLFI has officially signed an MOU with Pakistan. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=518.76s)]
*  It was an incredible experience meeting with Pakistan crypto council and the leaders shaping [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=523.0s)]
*  the future of crypto. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=528.48s)]
*  We're proud to be building with Pakistan to drive innovation forward. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=530.12s)]
*  This is just the beginning. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=534.24s)]
*  I'll play you about 30 seconds of this hype video. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  But mind you, the Trump family has a 60% stake in this WLFI as it's been reported. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=538.44s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=545.84s)]
*  Now let me flesh out some of these clips as well that has really made India furious. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=568.44s)]
*  I mean, and you've seen them there in those other clips that I played for you. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=586.1600000000001s)]
*  Here's Donald Trump on his most recent interview with Brett Baer saying that everyone knows [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=590.48s)]
*  that without me, the N-word would have been in place. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=598.92s)]
*  The N-word, Donald Trump says over and over again, which Donald Trump says the N-word [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=602.32s)]
*  means nuclear. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=606.32s)]
*  And here's kind of him saying that with Brett Baer. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=607.64s)]
*  Here play this. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=609.8s)]
*  It was tit for tat. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=610.8s)]
*  It was getting deeper and more, I mean, more missiles. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=611.8s)]
*  Now, this was Donald Trump giving a speech from the Oval Office where he falsely took [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=619.24s)]
*  credit for brokering the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=646.56s)]
*  And as I just showed you before with the foreign minister, Donald Trump had no role in the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=650.9599999999999s)]
*  ceasefire really at all. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=655.3599999999999s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=657.8s)]
*  The strength and the wisdom and fortitude to fully know and to understand the gravity [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=658.8s)]
*  of the situation. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=662.66s)]
*  And we helped a lot. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=664.92s)]
*  And we helped also with trade. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=668.8s)]
*  I said, come on, we're going to do a lot of trade with you guys. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=670.1999999999999s)]
*  Let's stop it. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=673.9599999999999s)]
*  If you stop it, we're doing trade. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=675.5s)]
*  If you don't stop it, we're not going to do any trade. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=678.02s)]
*  People have never really used trade the way I used it, that I can tell you. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=681.38s)]
*  And all of a sudden they said, I think we're going to stop. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=685.14s)]
*  And they have. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=688.5400000000001s)]
*  And they did it for a lot of reasons. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=689.5400000000001s)]
*  But trade is a big one. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=692.5400000000001s)]
*  We're going to do a lot of trade with Pakistan. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=694.1s)]
*  We're going to do a lot of trade with India. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=696.86s)]
*  We're negotiating with India right now. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=698.46s)]
*  We're going to be soon negotiating with Pakistan. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=700.14s)]
*  And we stopped the nuclear conflict. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=703.38s)]
*  I think it could have been a bad nuclear war. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=704.94s)]
*  Millions of people could have been killed. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=708.78s)]
*  So I'm very proud of that. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=710.38s)]
*  And this was Donald Trump, what he said about Tim Cook. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=711.9s)]
*  Let me play this. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=714.66s)]
*  Apple, as you know, is coming in. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=715.66s)]
*  And I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=718.34s)]
*  I said to him, Tim, you're my friend. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=720.58s)]
*  I treated you very good. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=721.98s)]
*  You're coming in with 500 billion dollars. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=722.98s)]
*  But now I hear you're building all over India. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=724.98s)]
*  I don't want you building in India. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=726.58s)]
*  You can build in India if you want to take care of India. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=727.98s)]
*  Because India is the highest, one of the highest tariff [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=732.18s)]
*  nations in the world. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=735.5s)]
*  It's very hard to sell into India. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=736.62s)]
*  And they've offered us a deal where basically they're [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=740.06s)]
*  willing to literally charge us no tariff. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=742.42s)]
*  So we go from the highest tariff. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=747.54s)]
*  You couldn't do business in India. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=749.66s)]
*  We're not even a top 30 in India because the tariff is so high, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=751.86s)]
*  to a point where they have actually told us, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=755.98s)]
*  I assume you too, Scott, you were working on that also, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=758.06s)]
*  there will be no tariff. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=761.6600000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=763.02s)]
*  Would you say that's the difference? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=763.34s)]
*  They're the highest. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=764.94s)]
*  And now they're saying no tariff. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=765.74s)]
*  But I said to Tim, I said, Tim, we treated you really good. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=766.9s)]
*  We put up with all the plants that you built in China. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=770.7s)]
*  So I think you can see why there, why India would be [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=774.78s)]
*  absolutely livid and pissed about this. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=778.74s)]
*  And again, this is being reported by media in India [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=781.4200000000001s)]
*  and elsewhere and international media, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=784.82s)]
*  but not being reported in the United States. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=786.58s)]
*  And I think it's an important factor for you to see how, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=789.02s)]
*  one, people view Trump internationally as this clown, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=792.62s)]
*  as this person who's just focused on himself [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=797.38s)]
*  and putting his interests above even the United States. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=801.22s)]
*  But anyway, let me just conclude this video by saying, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=806.22s)]
*  I think it's why it's so important that we [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=810.46s)]
*  have an international perspective of things [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=812.3000000000001s)]
*  and we keep you posted at every step of the way. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83cRrJqIHU&t=814.54s)]
