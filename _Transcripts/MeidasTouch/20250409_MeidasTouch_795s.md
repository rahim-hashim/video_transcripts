# UH OH! MAGA Mike PANICS as GOP REVOLT Grows
**MeidasTouch:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc)
*  According to multiple reports today, MAGA Republican Congress member Stubbe [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=0.0s)]
*  looked at MAGA Mike Johnson and said, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=5.04s)]
*  I rebuke you in the name of Jesus. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=12.16s)]
*  This is as chaos is engulfing the MAGA Republicans who have submitted to doing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=14.92s)]
*  everything that Donald Trump wants with these ridiculous, dangerous, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=20.56s)]
*  disastrous tariffs against the world that are crashing our markets and making an [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=25.52s)]
*  already catastrophic economic situation created by Trump over the past few months. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=32.36s)]
*  Significantly worse, but MAGA Mike Johnson, even though he's been rebuked in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=39.16s)]
*  the name of Jesus by other MAGA Republicans, not ready to answer questions [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=44.16s)]
*  about the tariffs, he's like, just got to play it out. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  We just got to see here, play this clip. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  We have to give the president space. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=54.08s)]
*  His strategy is playing out. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  It's been less than a week or so. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=57.36s)]
*  Just give him some space. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  Give him some space. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  Let him chill. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=63.67999999999999s)]
*  Let him golf. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=64.24s)]
*  Let him hang. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=65.2s)]
*  Let's take a look at Democratic Congress members fighting back. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=66.36s)]
*  Here's Jamie Raskin on the floor earlier. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=69.32s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=72.28s)]
*  The whole country is reeling right now from the economic disaster [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=74.4s)]
*  Trump has plunged us into. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=78.12s)]
*  He destroyed more than $10 trillion in American wealth in a single week. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  And then he went golfing and bragged to America about winning the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=85.52s)]
*  tournament at his own golf course. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=89.0s)]
*  That's like bragging about being endorsed by your own campaign manager. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  So much winning the country can hardly stand how much winning Trump is [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=96.2s)]
*  doing for himself and Elon Musk. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=100.84s)]
*  Next up, Congress member McGovern play this clip. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=103.4s)]
*  And I guess we're not going to get an answer, but I, it wasn't allowed [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=107.44s)]
*  because Republicans changed how time itself works in the house to prevent a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=112.0s)]
*  vote on tariffs that is allowed under the law. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=117.44s)]
*  I just want to be clear here, Mr. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=120.64s)]
*  Speaker, because the stakes are very high. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  We're talking about whether this house has the authority under the current [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  rules to stop the president of the United States from imposing disastrous, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  calamitous tariffs that are causing economic chaos, raising prices for [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=133.68s)]
*  regular Americans and causing uncertainty for businesses. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=138.76s)]
*  A motion to discharge ranking member Meeks resolution is not allowed because [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=143.36s)]
*  Republicans literally change the definition of what a day is to protect [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=149.64s)]
*  themselves from voting on tariffs. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=156.04s)]
*  Now we should have been able to call it up after 15 days, but Republicans are [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=158.56s)]
*  pretending 34 days is less than 15 days. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=162.56s)]
*  Republic. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=167.52s)]
*  Next up Congress member Joe Nogus on the floor. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=168.76s)]
*  Let's play the clip. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=171.44s)]
*  It is difficult to listen to this debate, to hear the arguments peddled by my [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=172.84s)]
*  colleagues that are hypocritical at best and intellectually dishonest at worst. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=179.04s)]
*  Where were my colleagues when 14 federal judges appointed by Republican [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=185.4s)]
*  presidents issued injunctions against policies that the Biden administration [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=191.44s)]
*  was pursuing over the course of the last four years, where were you? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=196.6s)]
*  Nowhere to be found. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=199.8s)]
*  I don't remember my colleagues bringing this bill to the floor. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=201.4s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=205.4s)]
*  Spare me your feigned indignation. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=207.2s)]
*  They talk of defending the constitution when president Trump is running rough [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=210.4s)]
*  shot over provision after provision. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=215.24s)]
*  They talk of, of judicial overreach as they attack judges across the country. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=218.0s)]
*  Read the constitution, read the federalist papers. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  Let's bring in democratic Congress member, Joe Nogus, Congress member, I [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=228.88s)]
*  guess, where do we start here? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=232.6s)]
*  I guess the MAGA Republicans changing the calendar and dates so that they're too [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  cowardly to talk about the tariffs that are destroying the economy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=241.0s)]
*  Let's start there and then let's move on to the next topic. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=244.88s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's exactly right. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=248.0s)]
*  First, good to be with you, Ben. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=249.39999999999998s)]
*  Always. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=250.55999999999997s)]
*  You articulated well, the house Republican caucus is [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  engulfed in chaos and dysfunction. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=254.44s)]
*  They have been attacking judges. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=257.64s)]
*  They're undermining the rule of law. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=259.47999999999996s)]
*  And of course now capitulating to Donald Trump as he literally puts our economy [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=260.88s)]
*  into free fall and that's precisely what they've done. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=266.47999999999996s)]
*  As you mentioned, this procedural tool that they've used just a few weeks ago, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=269.84s)]
*  they pass legislation to essentially prevent the house from touching these [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=274.4s)]
*  tariffs that are now destroying our economy in real time. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=279.68s)]
*  So, uh, it is the height of absurdity. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=284.12s)]
*  And, you know, there are a lot of folks in my community and across the country [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=287.4s)]
*  right now who are reeling from the economic chaos that president Trump has initiated [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=290.72s)]
*  and seems fixated on continuing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  And it's going to have disastrous consequences for working [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=300.32s)]
*  families in our country. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=302.8s)]
*  Let's talk about their attack on the judiciary. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=304.68s)]
*  I've seen you at these hearings in the rules committee, cross-examining the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  MAGA Republican Congress members and witnesses like Newt Gingrich showed up. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=312.32s)]
*  And all of a sudden they're like, these judicial activists, judges are doing all [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  of this. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=322.72s)]
*  And meanwhile, they went to a judge in the Northern district of Texas, um, who [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=323.08s)]
*  would issue all their national injunctions for them. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=328.0s)]
*  And by the way, like even on Tuesday, it was judge McFadden, a Trump appointed [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=330.24s)]
*  judge who issued the injunction. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  There were George W. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=337.76s)]
*  Bush judges who issued injunctions. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  So talk to us about that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=342.44s)]
*  I mean, look, I don't know why Newt Gingrich was there, but I digress. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  I would say that, uh, you know, the house Republicans have, as I said on the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=346.24s)]
*  floor, put forward an argument that is hypocrisy at best, uh, and ultimately [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=350.8s)]
*  and intellectually dishonest at its worst. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=355.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, they had no complaints when during the course of the Biden administration, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  federal judges appointed by Republican presidents, uh, were pausing or blocking [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  different actions that the Biden administration sought to take now that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=368.04s)]
*  they are losing in court, that you have federal judges that were appointed by [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  Republican presidents, including, as you mentioned, several judges that were [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=376.6s)]
*  appointed by president Trump during his first term, you have these judges ruling [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  that his actions are unlawful, that they are unconstitutional, that they are [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=383.48s)]
*  subverting the constitution. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=386.72s)]
*  And lo and behold, Republicans now want to limit the ability of district judges [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=388.88000000000005s)]
*  across the country from providing the kind of relief that would vindicate the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=393.88000000000005s)]
*  American people and vindicate the constitution. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  It is hypocrisy. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=399.88000000000005s)]
*  And, uh, you know, in my view, I think deeply disproportionate to the values [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=401.72s)]
*  of the American people and ultimately to the values that are embedded in our [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=406.6s)]
*  constitution, having an independent and impartial judiciary. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=410.36s)]
*  What's, what's going on here with what Trump's doing with the economy? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, look in the past, when there have been recessions, great recessions, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=418.28s)]
*  there has usually been a bubble that has burst. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  There's been some traumatic event like COVID or 9-11 or a dot com burst where [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  the contagion kind of spreads to other sectors that people didn't see the blind [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=433.56s)]
*  spots in the economy, but like to actually have someone appearing to [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=439.24s)]
*  intentionally wreck the economy with things we know are going to wreck the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=445.28s)]
*  economy and then kind of enjoying it and golfing and gloating about it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=451.4s)]
*  And then your Republican colleagues are like, you know what? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=457.08s)]
*  I think this is great. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=460.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=462.08s)]
*  I, it's what's, what is even, how do I, what's going on? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=462.36s)]
*  I, you explained it well. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=465.64s)]
*  I mean, it's confounding, right? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  It's totally nonsensical. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=468.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't know that there's a historical parallel that one could point to where [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=469.96000000000004s)]
*  you have a president who's taking actions that he knows will cause a global recession. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=472.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=479.32s)]
*  Literally taking the actions that he did last week with the tariffs and [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=480.12s)]
*  approaching in this reckless haphazard fashion, tanking the stock market, you [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=484.52s)]
*  know, millions of Americans, 401ks vanishing overnight. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=489.04s)]
*  And meanwhile, he's where he's on the way to Florida golfing, right. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=493.0s)]
*  While Americans across the country are trying to discern how to find a [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=496.92s)]
*  path forward for their families. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=501.68s)]
*  It's completely reckless. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=503.36s)]
*  And, you know, unfortunately there's no Republicans in the house Republican [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=505.08s)]
*  caucus who have as yet are willing to stand up to him, to not capitulate. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=509.24s)]
*  And by the way, as you know, Ben, they're doing this while simultaneously trying [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=514.76s)]
*  to pass a budget resolution that we've talked about before that would gut [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=518.72s)]
*  Medicaid, that would cut social safety net programs, food assistance, all to pay [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=523.28s)]
*  for tax cuts for the richest billionaires in our country, again, deeply out of step [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=528.4s)]
*  with the values of the folks that I represent in Western and Northern Colorado. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=535.2s)]
*  And I am hopeful that folks will see the light here and that we can ultimately [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=539.72s)]
*  prevent this budget resolution from coming to fruition. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=545.72s)]
*  Where are we at with the budget resolution? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=549.52s)]
*  There's so much going on and bad things that Donald Trump's doing that it's like [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=551.48s)]
*  where we last left off with the budget resolution, the House of Representatives [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=556.52s)]
*  passed an outline and then the Senate had to agree on that outline. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=560.24s)]
*  Have they done that now officially? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=564.88s)]
*  And now is there reconciliation? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=567.44s)]
*  What, what complicated wonky language are we watching? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=569.4s)]
*  But like more importantly, what's really happening and what? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=573.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=576.48s)]
*  I mean, look, essentially the House, as you know, House Republicans pushed through [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=577.24s)]
*  on a partisan basis, a budget resolution that would lead to the biggest tap, the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=582.28s)]
*  biggest gutting of Medicaid in the history of the country, right? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=588.28s)]
*  The Senate passed a resolution that would also result in draconian cuts across the [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=591.64s)]
*  board. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=596.92s)]
*  And now House Republicans seem inept at their ability to come to an agreement [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=597.6s)]
*  with their colleagues, Republicans in the Senate. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  They have yet to pass the budget resolution. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=605.0s)]
*  It appears that they may try to do that tomorrow. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=607.64s)]
*  But again, there's an opportunity here for just a few Republicans. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=610.4s)]
*  If four Republicans stood up and said, we're not going to get Medicaid, we're not [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=614.4s)]
*  going to take this step of gutting Medicaid, taking away health care from working [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=619.88s)]
*  families, from seniors, right? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=624.88s)]
*  Who are receiving nursing care in our districts just to pay for tax cuts for [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=626.7199999999999s)]
*  billionaires. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=631.3199999999999s)]
*  They could stop that resolution tomorrow. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=632.04s)]
*  And so we're just going to keep building the pressure and keep calling it out and [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  exposing to the American public their plan, which I think the American people [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=638.9599999999999s)]
*  recognize it. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=643.0799999999999s)]
*  They see the economic chaos that Donald Trump has already created over the course [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=643.88s)]
*  of the last 10, 11 weeks, and they don't want any part of it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  So what's next? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=652.04s)]
*  What does the fight look like going forward? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=652.8s)]
*  I mean, we're seeing judicial fights. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=654.7199999999999s)]
*  We're seeing members. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=657.56s)]
*  I saw lots of members at the protest. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=660.24s)]
*  I'm seeing shadow hearings. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=662.12s)]
*  I'm seeing members go into swing districts and red districts. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=663.56s)]
*  What would tell us as of April 9th, 2025, what is the fight against, frankly, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=668.1999999999999s)]
*  authoritarianism in America look like? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=673.72s)]
*  Yeah, look, it's all hands on deck. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=675.64s)]
*  You described so many of the components, right? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=677.3199999999999s)]
*  And in the aggregate, it's all a representation of us pushing back against the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=679.84s)]
*  unlawful and unconstitutional actions of the Trump administration. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=684.48s)]
*  The mobilization you're seeing town halls and Republican districts, right? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=688.36s)]
*  Of course, on the judicial fight and the litigation, as you know, I lead the [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=693.4s)]
*  litigation task force. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=698.12s)]
*  House Democrats have now become involved in four different lawsuits, which we can [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=699.32s)]
*  talk at greater length about in one of those lawsuits, by the way, defending the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=704.0s)]
*  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=708.44s)]
*  And that lawsuit was successful at the district court level. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=710.24s)]
*  District judge ultimately prevented the Trump administration from dismantling the [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=713.4s)]
*  Consumer Protection Bureau and House Democrats were proud to be in that fight. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=717.72s)]
*  And then ultimately the legislative battle. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=721.36s)]
*  And tomorrow is going to be a big day. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=723.6s)]
*  And you're going to see House Democrats on the floor making the case to the [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=725.5200000000001s)]
*  American people is why this Republican budget would be disastrous for the [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=729.5600000000001s)]
*  American people. And we're just going to have to keep up the drumbeat. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=734.0s)]
*  What when's the vote on that? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=737.5600000000001s)]
*  Is that is that this time will tell? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=739.12s)]
*  I mean, we thought it would be tomorrow. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=741.2s)]
*  But at this point, as you described that meeting and some of the reporting about [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=742.72s)]
*  Stubbe and the rest and Republicans and sort of disarray and dysfunction, time [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=746.92s)]
*  will tell. It's an open question as to when that vote will be. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=751.92s)]
*  But we'll be here as long as it takes to oppose that legislation and do everything [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=754.28s)]
*  we can to try to stop it. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=758.24s)]
*  Congressman Nagoos, thanks for joining us. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=760.24s)]
*  I really do enjoy the cross examination you do of the mega Republicans who show up [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=762.04s)]
*  in the rules committee. It's great when Aysen posts those clips. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=766.96s)]
*  So thank you and I hope you come back down soon. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYTCZR0byzc&t=770.6s)]
