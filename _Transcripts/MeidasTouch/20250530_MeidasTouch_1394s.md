# Fox News COLLAPSES on LIVE TV and ATTACKS REAGAN
**MeidasTouch:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0)
*  You know, state regime media known as Fox is in a total collapse when it goes and attacks Ronald Reagan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=0.0s)]
*  as being really bad on trade because a Reagan-appointed judge ruled against Donald Trump on a three-judge panel [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=7.68s)]
*  joined by a Trump-appointed judge and a Biden-appointed judge. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=16.8s)]
*  All three judges said that Donald Trump's tariff policy was patently unlawful. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=20.8s)]
*  You know, that ruling is now stayed by a federal court of appeals. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=26.4s)]
*  But the way Fox was spending the whole day attacking that was they would bring on Howard Lutnick [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=30.72s)]
*  and they spent the day with their guests attacking Reagan. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=36.48s)]
*  Reagan bad on trade. Reagan not good. Watch this. Play this clip. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=39.28s)]
*  Was he surprised about this three-judge panel because it was a Reagan judge, it was a Trump judge, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=43.36s)]
*  and then it was an Obama judge, and it was a unanimous ruling on this court? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  Is he surprised by that? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, he was not happy with the panel because what you call the Trump judge [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  is just one of these blue-slip judges, meaning it was a Democrat judge. It was their seat, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  and he just approved their seat, which is the deal for those kind of things. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=71.2s)]
*  And, you know, while we would love Ronald Reagan, you know, on trade, he just was not a strong trade guy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=75.28s)]
*  So, you know, I think the president saw the panel as weak. He's been through this kind of stuff [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=81.92s)]
*  before. I think he's confident on appeal. He's confident at the Supreme Court, and I think he [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=88.16s)]
*  knows he's going to win because he's got to protect the American people. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=94.16s)]
*  You're going to go after Ronald Reagan. It's wild. But it wasn't just unique to Howard Lutnick, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=97.2s)]
*  the ShamWow salesman right there. For those who know ShamWow, you know what I'm talking about [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=102.4s)]
*  right there. Peter Navarro was on Fox, and Peter Navarro talked about the rogue judges, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=106.4s)]
*  the rogue Reagan judge, the rogue Trump judge. And the host was like, the rogue Reagan. Yeah, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  Reagan wasn't good on trade. Reagan was bad on. He was a free trader. Here, play this clip. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  And with respect to the legal arguments themselves, these are rogue judges that are basically operating. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=125.28s)]
*  One was appointed by Donald Trump. That's a rogue judge. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=132.08s)]
*  There was one appointed by Donald Trump. And one by Reagan. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=135.12s)]
*  He was a career bureaucrat over at USTR. But more importantly, the person who wrote the decision, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  Rastani, was appointed by Reagan, free trader. She's the one who took the lead trying to stop [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=143.12s)]
*  the Section 232 tariffs and got overruled in the appeals court. So there's a lot of stuff going on. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=150.64s)]
*  Watching these Republicans go full MAGA and contort themselves into whatever the heck Donald Trump is [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  doing, which is fascism melded with central planning combined with cacostocracy, idiocracy, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=164.08s)]
*  is just a sight to behold. Bring on the scam artists. Bring on the con artists. Bring on Mr. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=172.24s)]
*  ShamWow, Howard Lutnick, Donald Trump's commerce secretary. And here Howard Lutnick says, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=178.72000000000003s)]
*  it's all good. We're bringing in $10 trillion to build factories. $10 trillion. They just make up [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=184.96s)]
*  numbers. Trillion, 10 trillion. And then they do the thing with their hands to make it seem like [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=192.24s)]
*  extra persuasive. 10 trillion, everybody. Here, play this clip. I think he knows he's going to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=197.28s)]
*  win because he's got to protect the American people. He's got to protect the American workers. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=202.24s)]
*  He's got $10 trillion coming to build factories in America. And he's going to stand for the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=206.56s)]
*  American people. And he's got lots of other authorities. But I think this one's going to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=212.4s)]
*  work and it's going to hold. You just have to get real judges. 10 trillion. What the hell are you [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  talking about? And then Howard Lutnick continues down this line of being a con artist and a scammer. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=221.36s)]
*  And he goes, there's $10 trillion in factories being built. And he goes, probably we're growing [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=227.84s)]
*  the economy 50% faster than otherwise. So $10 trillion, the economy's growing by 50%. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  None of this is true. You're just literally making up fake numbers that are large numbers. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=242.0s)]
*  Here, play this clip. The economic growth that Donald Trump is driving here, right? He's got $10 [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=246.96s)]
*  trillion with the factories being built. That's huge economic growth. It'll probably grow the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=253.44s)]
*  economy 50% faster than would have otherwise grown. And then you've got the ability for us to export. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=258.96s)]
*  Right? We're growing our ability to export. Each and every one of these countries allows us to have [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=266.56s)]
*  market access. You know what that means? It means our farmers, our ranchers, our fishermen, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=271.6s)]
*  our manufacturing can sell, finally sell overseas. Our car manufacturers, everybody can finally sell [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=276.56s)]
*  fairly overseas. You could see the U.S. economy double its growth rate under Donald Trump because [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=284.48s)]
*  of these policies. So I think that's what you've got to look at. Yes, the economy is contracting. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  The first quarter GDP was negative. Jobless claims for the past month exceeded expectations. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=298.24s)]
*  What was it? 241,000 jobless claims. We're seeing earnings down amongst companies. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=304.64s)]
*  You could say all these big numbers you want. What did Donald Trump say? I brought back $5 trillion [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  from the Middle East. How'd you bring back $5 trillion? The entire GDP of Qatar is $200 billion. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=317.6s)]
*  The entire GDP of the UAE is $400 billion. So you're bringing back 20x, 50x what their GDP is, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=325.04s)]
*  and 20% of the entire American GDP. They're just lying. They're just making up numbers. And now [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=333.68s)]
*  they have to go and attack Iran. Their former hero was Reagan, Reagan, Reagan, Reagan, Reagan. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=340.24s)]
*  And now they don't. Reagan was bad on free trade. Then bring in Treasury Secretary Scott Besant. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=345.20000000000005s)]
*  I don't even know what the hell this is that I'm about to show you. But Treasury Secretary [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=351.84s)]
*  Besant is asked, so how are the trade talks going with China? Because didn't you previously reduce [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=356.32s)]
*  the tariffs from 145% to 30%? And wasn't Xi Jinping and Trump supposed to? How are they going? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=364.08s)]
*  And here you have Besant go, well, they stalled. They're stalled. Here, play this clip. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=370.55999999999995s)]
*  And what about China, specifically China, and that obviously started in a different place. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=379.04s)]
*  How can you characterize those talks now? I would say that they are a bit stalled. I believe that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=384.8s)]
*  we will be having more talks with them in the next few weeks. And I believe we may at some point have [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  a call between the president and party chair Xi. So stalled. There was a time when the president [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=401.92s)]
*  thought that that was moving forward pretty significantly. Again, I think that given the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=411.04s)]
*  magnitude of the talks, given the complexity, that this is going to require both leaders to weigh in [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=419.04s)]
*  with each other. They have a very good relationship. And I am confident that the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=428.32000000000005s)]
*  Chinese will come to the table when President Trump makes his promises known. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  Everything out of their mouth is either a lie or utterly pathetic. I just want you to think, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=440.72s)]
*  what do you think they're thinking in Beijing when they watch what I just showed you? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=448.56s)]
*  What do you think they're thinking in the European Union when they're watching what I just showed you? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=452.8s)]
*  I could do in Canada, in Australia, pathetic, weak liars about everything, about everything. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=458.8s)]
*  Here, Treasury Secretary Scott Besson, then he goes, we need to make the United States look more [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=467.68s)]
*  like Florida. We should be more like Florida and less like New York. Here, play this clip. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=474.64000000000004s)]
*  We're going to deliver a better product to the American people. I lived in New York. I lived in [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=480.0s)]
*  Florida. And the state of New York spends about $235 billion a year. The state of New York spends [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=487.28s)]
*  about $235 billion a year. The state of Florida spends about $125 billion. Both states have [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=496.96s)]
*  approximately the same number of people, but Florida doesn't have an income tax. And I can [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=503.52s)]
*  tell you having lived in both, it's better not to have an income tax, and Florida gives better [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=508.16s)]
*  services. So we want the US to be more like Florida, less like New York. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=512.96s)]
*  And it's always just interesting to me when I see them attacking these blue states. One of the [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=517.28s)]
*  states they attack very frequently is California, which has the fourth largest GDP in the world. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=522.88s)]
*  If California was a country, it would have the fourth largest GDP in the world, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=530.72s)]
*  yet they attack California relentlessly. They attack New York relentlessly. Let me just look at [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=536.72s)]
*  the homicide rate in New York is much lower than Florida. The life expectancy in New York is [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=541.12s)]
*  significantly higher than Florida. The uninsured rate in New York is much lower than Florida. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=546.64s)]
*  But go on, go on and tell me. And by the way, all of this stuff about, oh, people were leaving to go [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=552.64s)]
*  to Florida, BS. It's going in the reverse direction right now when people are seeing that DeSantis [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=558.1600000000001s)]
*  ran that state into the ground. All right, bring in [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=564.88s)]
*  Maga Mike Johnson for some lying. Don't worry, I'll fact check him to his face right now. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=568.96s)]
*  So Maga Mike Johnson goes on Fox and he's trying to defend this disastrous budget that would add [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=574.4s)]
*  four to five trillion immediately to the deficit that would take away Medicaid from tens of millions [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=580.56s)]
*  of people, cut Medicare for people, cut people's food stamps, their SNAP benefits, their rental [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=586.4s)]
*  assistance. It attacks women's reproductive rights, harms infrastructure projects, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=592.4s)]
*  goes after climate. I can go on and on and on here. But here, Maga Mike Johnson, the speaker goes, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=598.56s)]
*  no, no, no, everybody. The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, which has given you these estimates, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=604.72s)]
*  they're a leftist Democrat organization, he goes. They're liars. They're funded by the Democrats. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=611.92s)]
*  They're quite literally a nonpartisan group. Phil Swaggle, the current CBO director, worked in George [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=618.32s)]
*  W. Bush Treasury Department, was chosen as the CBO director by Senate Republicans. Swaggle, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=625.5200000000001s)]
*  officially chosen for CBO director by Senate Republicans. But go on, Maga Mike. Lie to the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=632.5600000000001s)]
*  people for Donald Trump. Play this clip. Yes, I sent my good friend, Elon, a long [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=639.12s)]
*  text message last night explaining that it can be both big and beautiful. Okay. So what I wanted [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=643.76s)]
*  to make sure that he understands is that the projection that he's referring to in others is [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=649.04s)]
*  from the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office. They are historically totally unreliable. It's [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=654.08s)]
*  run by Democrats. Eighty-four percent of the number crunchers over there are donors to big Democrats. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=659.28s)]
*  They don't have our best interests in mind, and they've always been off. By way of example, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  they were off on their projections of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the first Trump administration [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=668.48s)]
*  by one trillion dollars. The problem is they do not use what we call dynamic scoring. What that [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=672.48s)]
*  means in layman's terms is they don't give us any credit for the extraordinary economic growth that [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=678.24s)]
*  will be spurred along by this bill. This is a pro-growth package. Lower tax rates, less regulation. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=683.44s)]
*  We'll do exactly what we did in the first Trump administration, but this time on steroids. And so [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=690.08s)]
*  we're going to have an extraordinary growth in the economy. You're going to have more jobs created, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=694.72s)]
*  higher wages, more labor participation, and all those things need to be factored in because that's [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=698.48s)]
*  reality. And by the way, the CBO is giving no credence whatsoever, no calculation at all to the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=703.04s)]
*  new revenues that are being produced by the Trump tariff policies and all these other things that [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=709.04s)]
*  are happening. So we believe we're going to get the economy going, and this is going to be deficit [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=713.36s)]
*  reducing at the end of the day. And also, as Philip Bump explains, as it turns out, Mike Johnson is [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=717.76s)]
*  wrong. And when you look at CBO projections, they're generally fairly accurate. And if anything, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=724.88s)]
*  they've understated, not overstated the amount that is actually added to the deficit. If anything, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=731.84s)]
*  they've understated it, but they usually are pretty on point. All right. More Fox people attacking [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=740.24s)]
*  Reagan and you had to have Jessica Tarlov, the lone pro-democracy voice on Fox explaining to her [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=748.4s)]
*  panel, guys, you realize that was a Reagan appointee and a Trump appointee who wrote, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=755.4399999999999s)]
*  who ruled against Trump. What are you talking about? These radical judges here play this clip. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=761.92s)]
*  He's doing this because he knows that I'm right about it. You brought it up. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=766.48s)]
*  Because I'm just responding to your erroneous assertions. In just the last month, 96% [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=769.84s)]
*  of federal district court rulings went against the Trump administration because they are not [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=776.32s)]
*  following those. But we're still moving the baton. They're Trump appointees. They're Bush appointees. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=780.72s)]
*  It's all appealable. It will be appeal. Look, they could win in the end, but they might lose in the [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=787.36s)]
*  end. So all I was saying is they've got to have a backup plan. Yeah. What's the backup plan? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=793.44s)]
*  Okay. So you ever hit that mid-morning wall where your brain's foggy, your energy's dragging, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=799.6s)]
*  and even your to-do list is giving you that side eye? Yeah, that was me until I found something [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=803.44s)]
*  that actually helps and is in packed with junk. This podcast is sponsored by Peak Pure and Natural [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=808.0s)]
*  and their product Peak Beats is a total game changer. It's a simple natural way to support [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=813.44s)]

*  energy. You just scoop, stir, and go. It tastes great, slightly sweet with a little tart kick, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=837.84s)]
*  and it even includes a proprietary mango powder that helps with circulation to your eyes and ears. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=844.0s)]
*  Bonus, I started using Peak Beats in the morning and immediately felt more energized and the energy [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=850.16s)]
*  lasts all day. I could go from working to a workout and I don't crash by 3 PM anymore. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=855.36s)]

*  Thoughts on this on-again-off-again judicial tug of war over tariffs? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=920.56s)]
*  Brett, it seems highly inappropriate for the judiciary to wade in here when the Senate had [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=925.6s)]
*  the opportunity to override the president and didn't. So in terms of separation of powers, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=932.48s)]
*  the Senate has chosen not to exercise their powers, and the president absolutely has the [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=938.88s)]
*  right to set the trade agenda for the U.S. This administration is committed to fair trade, and we [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=947.12s)]
*  are striking the best deals for the American people, and anything that the courts do to get [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=956.88s)]
*  in the way both harms the American people in terms of trade and in terms of tariff revenue. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=962.0s)]
*  As Elon Musk quits his role at Doge, Jesse Waters has to praise this guy in the weirdest terms, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=968.88s)]
*  and he's like, all the young men, they idolize Elon. They want to have Elon's trucks. They want [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=976.32s)]
*  big balls. So what he says on Fox, he goes, they want to be with big balls. Play this clip. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=982.64s)]
*  You're saying how much you need men. Young men idolize Elon Musk. They want to be him. They want [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=987.84s)]
*  to be based. They want to ride around in his trucks, and they want to hang with big balls. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=994.5600000000001s)]
*  And now every time you attack Elon Musk, you're attacking all of the young men that you need. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=999.04s)]
*  They want to be with big balls? What in the Kim Jong-un weirdo stuff are we even, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1004.5600000000001s)]
*  they want to be with the big balls? Guys, this is not normal. I want to always bring this back. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1009.12s)]
*  What I'm showing you right now is dangerous, and it is not normal. Speaking of which, here's Sean [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1015.36s)]
*  Duffy, Donald Trump's transportation secretary who got famous during being a reality show person [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1021.92s)]
*  on the Real World Road Rules Challenge. Here he is talking about how he's using our taxpayer dollars [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1029.6s)]
*  for some July 4th challenge, and he wants the transportation department to win Trump's challenge. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1037.04s)]
*  So they're going to be doing like a tour of America. I don't know what the hell, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1043.44s)]
*  they think this is The Apprentice. It's a dystopian reality show that we're all non-consenting [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1047.12s)]
*  participants in here play this clip. Yeah, so listen, we're about to celebrate America's [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1052.1599999999999s)]
*  250th birthday. There's going to be a year-long celebration starting this July 4th. The president [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1056.7199999999998s)]
*  has told all departments to come up with ways to celebrate this anniversary. So at DOT, by the way, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1061.84s)]
*  we have the best idea of all departments. We're winning the challenge. We're going to do the Great [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1067.6s)]
*  American Road Trip. And here he is, a deer with headlights right here or deer in headlights right [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1071.52s)]
*  here. Sean Duffy basically saying, the Biden Buttigieg, the Biden Buttigieg administration, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1076.32s)]
*  they ruined the transportation. I have to fix it. I have to fix it. Dude, there were these problems [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1083.6s)]
*  didn't exist under Biden and Buttigieg. Act like a leader for once and stop blaming them for all of [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1089.12s)]
*  your freaking problems, you idiots. Play this clip. If I increase the pipeline of new people [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1096.24s)]
*  coming in and I can keep those controllers from retiring, that's going to make up the difference [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1100.88s)]
*  as we get more controllers into the system. But this has been a problem for a long time. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1106.3200000000002s)]
*  The Buttigieg Biden administration didn't want to fix it. Right? All of these problems were well [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1111.2s)]
*  known. They did nothing to make it better. And so they left it to us. We're going to fix it. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1116.16s)]
*  President Trump cares about the airspace, cares about the controllers, and we're going to work [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1121.44s)]
*  together with the Congress to make sure that we don't pass this problem off to the next [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1125.1200000000001s)]
*  administration. Then you got to bring on Peter Navarro. At least this Fox host asks him somewhat [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1129.28s)]
*  good questions like, okay, Navarro, what's the threat that's being posed by lululemon yoga pants [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1134.48s)]
*  and Wayfair furniture that you're sticking tower of Southern? What's the national emergency? Is [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1141.84s)]
*  there a lululemon national emergency that we should be aware about? Just watch how with ease, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1146.56s)]
*  this guy starts BSing. He has to like find his footing and say, okay, got it. Let me go into [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1152.3999999999999s)]
*  con artist mode here. Play this clip. Could you explain the administration's justification [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1157.52s)]
*  quickly if you could and the legality of economic emergency in vocation here on brats dolls and [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1162.08s)]
*  Wayfair furniture and lululemon yoga pants? That's going to be a hard sell to a court that those are [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1169.68s)]
*  economic emergencies that deserve tariffs. Okay. So let's take the fentanyl issue. I said lululemon [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1174.8799999999999s)]
*  and Wayfair. You want to do the reciprocal tariffs? Yes. Well, look, there are specks [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1183.28s)]
*  and grains of sand in a sea of a trade, $1.3 trillion trade deficit. And they are retail outlets [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1190.24s)]
*  that go to China and benefit from their seven deadly sins of job destruction, whether it's the [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1197.84s)]
*  currency manipulation, the counterfeiting, the piracy, the subsidies and everything on in between. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1204.08s)]
*  And the emergency is $1.3 trillion a year going abroad, $18 trillion of American wealth so far [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1212.16s)]
*  transferred into foreign hands and millions of jobs lost, hundreds of thousands of factories gone. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1221.6000000000001s)]
*  That's the emergency. And the American people understand this. Main street understands this. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1229.3600000000001s)]
*  Wall Street is in denial about this. And this rogue court apparently doesn't think that having [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1235.2s)]
*  Main Street America dying from fentanyl and not having jobs is an emergency. We think it is and [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1242.72s)]
*  damn well is. Speaking of con artist mode, then you have Maga Mike Johnson crediting the magic [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1249.2s)]
*  algorithms of Doge and said the magic algorithm of Doge fixed everything. Play this clip. And the [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1255.76s)]
*  beauty of what Doge has been able to do, the reason it's so revolutionary is because Elon [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1261.2s)]
*  cracked the code. He had access, all the stars aligned. We had a president was bold enough to do [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1266.32s)]
*  it. We had somebody with Elon's talent and capability to come in and have his magic algorithms [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1270.4s)]
*  running through the data to find all these irregularities. And these are things that have [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1275.68s)]
*  been hidden from Congress, right? We've been trying to do our oversight responsibility, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1279.1200000000001s)]
*  but the bureaucracy was hiding these things. And so this changes the way government works. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1283.28s)]
*  And Elon's exactly right. The Doge effort will go on long beyond his tenure as a temporary [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1288.08s)]
*  assistant in all this because it's changing the way people look at this. And the oversight's [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1294.6399999999999s)]
*  a really important component and that's going to be a permanent part of government now. And it's [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1298.8799999999999s)]
*  an exciting thing. Let's come with the receipts as Carl Keatonia points out. US government spending [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1302.6399999999999s)]
*  since January 21st is up 8.7% over the equivalent period in 2024, up 7.2% over 2023. Musk not only [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1307.76s)]
*  accomplished nothing, but there's more federal spending right now. But here's what Elon Musk [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1319.76s)]
*  had to say, did my best, did my best. As Carl Keatonia writes, it was a sheepish admission, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1324.8s)]
*  despite Musk's unbridled glee at unleashing months of anxiety and chaos among federal workers, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1333.6s)]
*  the legacy of his tenure in the White House falls far short of his lofty promises to reinvent the [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1339.28s)]
*  federal government. Did my best, did my best. Oh my God, dripping with privilege while you've gutted [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1345.04s)]
*  and destroyed our federal government have crushed the lives of millions of people and millions of [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1354.56s)]
*  more people will suffer in the future as a result of the landmines that you've laid in our federal [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVLtleMoz0&t=1360.56s)]
