# Fox News LOSES CONTROL over Trump PLUMMETING FAST
**MeidasTouch:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU)
*  When you do a deep dive of the backgrounds of the state regime media known as Fox host like Laura Ingraham, you find some commonalities there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=0.0s)]
*  We spoke to Laura Ingraham's brother. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=9.3s)]
*  And here's what he had to say. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Curtis Ingraham had to say about growing up with his sister, Laura Ingraham. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=13.74s)]
*  It explains a lot. Let's play it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=17.68s)]
*  So my father was a Nazi sympathizer. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=19.28s)]
*  There was a copy of Mein Kampf on the living room bookshelf. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=23.14s)]
*  He was abusive. He was an alcoholic. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=26.48s)]
*  So we are in a we're in a in a family of anger. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=28.979999999999997s)]
*  That's from Laura Ingraham's brother right there. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  And now when you see her behavior these days, and it's been over the course of a decade at this point, the state regime North Korea style behavior, it's accelerating. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=35.64s)]
*  It's getting worse if you could even believe that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=47.42s)]
*  So now they're at the stage where we don't care that Donald Trump's polling is now in like the 30s. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  Screw it. Just whatever. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  He's having fun. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=56.92s)]
*  Kim Jong Un's having fun. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=58.28s)]
*  He's posting photos of himself dressed as the pope. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=59.86s)]
*  This is fun. Right. We haven't fun. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  It doesn't matter if he's destroying your lives here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=64.86s)]
*  Play this clip of her right here saying he's happy. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=66.72s)]
*  Happy Trump. Play it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=69.68s)]
*  I'm going to say this again. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=71.62s)]
*  I said it last night, but happy Trump is best Trump. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=73.02000000000001s)]
*  And he's having a great time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  He doesn't care about these stupid polls. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=78.16s)]
*  He's fighting stupid polls. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=79.78s)]
*  He's having a great time. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  He's doing deals with the Qataris, doing Trump resorts. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=82.88s)]
*  They're fun. The Abu Dhabi fund is using crypto. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=86.96s)]
*  Are you not having fun? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=90.58s)]
*  This is fun, everybody. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=93.16s)]
*  Then she like goes back and she's like, you know, the Democrats are doing what they always do. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  I want you to think about like Watergate and I want you to think about the January 6th hoax. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  That's what she calls it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=105.56s)]
*  And now they're trying to do it again with Trump right now in 2025. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=107.08s)]
*  Here, let's play this one. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  You know, I was thinking about this. I've been in Washington a long time. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=113.28s)]
*  This is all a sad repeat of what Republicans have been dealing with since around 1987. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=116.56s)]
*  Yeah, I worked in the Reagan administration in 1987 from the Bork hearings to Iran [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=122.26s)]
*  contract to the Russian collusion to the myriad anti-Trump hoaxes. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  Charlottesville, January 6th. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=131.26s)]
*  It's one long slash and burn campaign. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=133.0s)]
*  Democrats didn't really care about any of the underlying issues involving any of those stories. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=137.16s)]
*  They cared about gaining a political advantage. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=142.44s)]
*  Because she even talking about, you know, Charlottesville, January 6th, the way she says it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=147.04s)]
*  Let's bring in Matt Gertz, senior fellow at Media Matters. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=152.34s)]
*  You do deep studies on propaganda media. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=157.36s)]
*  What's taking place? You call it out, you expose it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=161.06s)]
*  I was fascinated by and we cover Fox here every day and you do every minute. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=164.5s)]
*  And so I was really interested in the study that you all did at Media Matters, where you focused on [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=169.76s)]
*  how basically all of the Trump regime cabinet people are like essentially 24-7 on Fox, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=176.24s)]
*  the revolving door that's taking place. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=183.0s)]
*  Talk to us first about your findings. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=185.88s)]
*  Then let's talk more broadly about the implication there, Matt. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=188.24s)]
*  Sure. So our latest report on this, we looked at all the people in the Trump administration [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=192.08s)]
*  and how they are a constant presence on Fox News and its sister network, Fox Business. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=200.38000000000002s)]
*  We tracked over the first 100 days of the Trump administration, something like 536 appearances [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=207.5s)]
*  of high ranking Trump administration officials on those networks. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=216.5s)]
*  Basically, what's happening is the Trump administration and Fox News are effectively, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  they've merged. They're effectively the same thing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=228.18s)]
*  It's very difficult to tell where the administration ends and the network picks up. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=230.74s)]
*  You've had a whole host of people that Trump hired from Fox News. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=235.94s)]
*  We've counted 22 individuals who have Fox on their resumes, who have ended up in the administration. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=241.9s)]
*  That includes cabinet officials. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=249.4s)]
*  The Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, got promoted from being Fox and Friends' weekend host. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=252.04s)]
*  Now he is in charge of the U.S. military. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=258.8s)]
*  Trump has always had a fixation with Fox News. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=263.1s)]
*  He watches a huge amount of it, really hours of it every day, according to a lot of reporting. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=266.64s)]
*  And so the people that he takes advice from, both inside and outside office now, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=274.2s)]
*  are people who made their names throwing bombs on Fox News, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=280.18s)]
*  attacking the left, complaining about various things that have annoyed them and annoy people on the right. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  That's the main job qualification to be an adviser to Donald Trump at this point. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  That's why we call it here state regime media, because there's this merger. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=304.62s)]
*  Now, this template, we see it like that exists in other authoritarian countries, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=310.18s)]
*  like in Russia, their state regime media. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=316.58s)]
*  The people are the oligarchs who are also like the hosts on the show, and they speak to Putin. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=319.82s)]
*  Putin tells them what to put on, and then they program around what the regime says. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=326.38s)]
*  I mean, we see this in North Korea, but y'all have been covering media for a long time. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=331.28s)]
*  In America, this is very different, and it's very alarming. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=338.88s)]
*  And talk about the implications of having essentially a cosplay cabinet that goes and plays dress up, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  and they show up in their different outfits, and they're not like rolling up their sleeves and doing the work. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=353.52s)]
*  They're too busy putting costumes on. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=360.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a good way to think about it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=362.52s)]
*  I mean, when you look at someone like Pam Bondi, who is currently in charge of the Justice Department, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=364.46s)]
*  she made two dozen appearances on different Fox News shows over the course of the first hundred days of the Trump administration. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  One day in four, she's going on Fox News to talk about whatever she says the Justice Department is doing. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=380.76s)]
*  That just doesn't really add up. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=387.21999999999997s)]
*  That's wildly disproportionate to what we've seen under previous administrations. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=389.26s)]
*  And that's because the Trump administration doesn't view itself as attempting to carry out public policy to benefit the people of the United States. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=396.4s)]
*  They see themselves as propagandists who are trying to spin what Trump is doing to the Fox clientele, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=406.64s)]
*  to the Trump base who are tuning into Fox every day to get their news. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=415.64s)]
*  They're trying to keep that base intact because they know that if that base cracks, they're in a huge amount of trouble. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=420.44s)]
*  As it is, they've seen the polls steadily decline over the first three months of the administration. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=427.88s)]
*  I would expect that to continue. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=434.06s)]
*  But if that core base, if the Fox News audience starts to leave Trump, it becomes a huge problem for the broader Republican Party. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=435.5s)]
*  And that is what the Trump cabinet seems to be focused on. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=447.26s)]
*  I'll show you this other clip right here of Laura Ingraham. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=454.02000000000004s)]
*  And this is just an example of kind of carrying out, you know, the Trump policy where she goes and she looks at the migrants [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=457.44s)]
*  or speaking to the camera of people who the Trump regime is disappearing to concentration camps in El Salvador. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=466.94s)]
*  And she's like, you better self-deport. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=473.76s)]
*  I'm telling you what to do now. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  See, you got to follow what I'm saying. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=477.9s)]
*  And then the Trump regime puts in what hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising on Fox in English to then kind of repeat the message to self-deport. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=480.2s)]
*  Like, that's where our taxpayer dollars go. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=493.24s)]
*  No wonder Doge has done nothing to actually lower federal spending and federal spending. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=494.96s)]
*  But here's an example of her then carrying out policy here. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=499.84s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=502.59999999999997s)]
*  But now the Trump team has a message to all those here who should not be. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=503.5s)]
*  You better self-deport now and not return or you could be on the next flight to El Salvador. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=509.40000000000003s)]
*  Just that sentence. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=517.88s)]
*  Being the bad guy, I gave a speech about this earlier this week at the Milken Institute where I'm like, just pull back for a second. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=521.2s)]
*  What the hell are we talking about here? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=529.44s)]
*  What did what am I listening to here? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=530.84s)]
*  Self-deport or you'll end up in a concentration camp in El Salvador without due process. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=534.08s)]
*  And Matt, I think one of the dangers here, I think corporate news, by and large, presents debates that really aren't debates. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=539.0400000000001s)]
*  Should there be due process? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=548.5400000000001s)]
*  You have someone on the left and someone on the right. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=550.3000000000001s)]
*  And then they argue, should there be due process? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=552.6s)]
*  As I say, I'm not debating somebody. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  There should be due process. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=556.58s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=557.7s)]
*  That's it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=558.1s)]
*  I'm not having a conversation. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=558.6s)]
*  But on Fox, they're spreading to their audience and they've got a lot of viewers. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=560.4s)]
*  That due process isn't even a thing. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=566.08s)]
*  And that this whole way of thinking of authoritarianism is normal. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=568.58s)]
*  What do we do to fight it? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=573.1s)]
*  What are you doing to combat it at Media Matters? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=574.3s)]
*  Because you're both descriptive at Media Matters. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=577.2s)]
*  You identify the problems, but then you try to fight the problems. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=580.7s)]
*  And I won't get into all the other stuff, but that's why y'all are frequently under attack. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=584.78s)]
*  By Trump and people very close to it because you identify it and you solve the problem. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=590.0s)]
*  So tell us, what are you doing to solve it? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=595.54s)]
*  How do we fight back? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=597.08s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, what we do at Media Matters is we watch all these people [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=598.44s)]
*  so that everyone else doesn't have to, right? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=604.08s)]
*  We spend a great deal of time, not only focused on Fox News, but in the deepest, darkest, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=606.28s)]
*  you know, parts of the internet, the streaming universe, and so on and so forth. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=613.48s)]
*  And what that means is we have a more granular understanding of where these attacks are coming from and where they're going. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=619.34s)]
*  We can tell well before it becomes a national story that something like critical race theory is going to break through. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=631.58s)]
*  What I think we need is more people to sort of pick up that ammunition and run with it, because we certainly, you know, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=640.12s)]
*  it doesn't help to be right all the time if no one else is paying attention to the message and passing it along to the rest of the public. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=648.04s)]
*  I think you're right that, you know, the mainstream press can be a little too factless about this stuff. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=654.42s)]
*  They are worried about the prospect of Donald Trump trying to destroy their businesses and their business models. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=660.68s)]
*  We need independent media to step up and let the public know what's going on when mainstream press can't do it. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=668.38s)]
*  To your point, and I'll just give our audience an example before we wrap up. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=676.38s)]
*  You know, the Republicans held a hearing this past week on United States fencing, and they were obsessed about they brought in like the president of USA Fencing, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=680.12s)]
*  who, by the way, doesn't get any federal funding. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=690.6800000000001s)]
*  But if you followed your reports and other people who were showing what was going on on Fox, Fox spent all of this time talking about a transgender fencing person and that that was like their big issue. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=693.0200000000001s)]
*  So the whole hearing was based around this Fox fencing story. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=705.06s)]
*  And the witness gets up here and there's asked, so do you get federal funding? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=710.3399999999999s)]
*  Like, why are we even here? And like, no, we don't get federal federal funding. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=715.3599999999999s)]
*  And that's because it originates on Fox. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=719.64s)]
*  They give the talking points. Anything else you think we're missing, Matt, while we got you on here? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=722.16s)]
*  Anything you're focused on that worries you that you think is not getting enough attention while we have you here in front of this huge audience? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=727.0999999999999s)]
*  You know, I always want more attention on the Medicaid cuts that the Republicans are brewing up. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=733.8s)]
*  It's unclear exactly how they're going to try to take health care away from millions of people, but they're going to try to do it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=741.0799999999999s)]
*  They need to find money from somewhere so they can pass their big tax cuts for the richest Americans. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=748.04s)]
*  And the the wealth they always come back to is people's health care. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=754.34s)]
*  It's an atrocity and it doesn't get, I think, nearly enough coverage. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=758.38s)]
*  Matt, we got to have you on more. I love the work that you guys are doing out there. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hz-mY7kJNU&t=763.64s)]
