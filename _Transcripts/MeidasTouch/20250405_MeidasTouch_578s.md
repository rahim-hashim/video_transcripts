# Trump in TERROR as PROTESTS ERUPT TODAY
**MeidasTouch:** [April 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY)
*  Do your job! Do your job! Do your job! Do your job! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=0.0s)]
*  So we've seen protests like that outside of MAGA Republican-led town halls. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=8.0s)]
*  We've seen the protests growing across the country. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=14.0s)]
*  Each week getting bigger, we've seen protests outside of Tesla. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=18.0s)]
*  Tesla, for example, as Elon Musk, Doge, and Trump take a wrecking ball to our economy, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=23.0s)]
*  to Social Security, to Medicaid, to our federal government. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=31.0s)]
*  Just take a look at this one. This is the Tesla protest in Boston. I'll show you a quick clip of it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=36.0s)]
*  The protest spirit has been growing week by week, and today, I'm sure you've all heard of it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=53.0s)]
*  It's the hands-off protest. It will be in Washington, D.C., but it will be in all 50 states as well. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=66.0s)]
*  And so as you wake up and you're watching this, there may be a hands-off protest taking place right now near you. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=73.0s)]
*  I want to give you all the information. We're going to be covering this today. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=81.0s)]
*  And of course, you all know, I mean, the news on Friday and Thursday, of course, this is the headline from Drudge. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=85.0s)]
*  Don crashing the markets. The Dow was down 2,231 points. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=92.0s)]
*  Donald Trump was then making posts bragging about crashing the market. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=100.0s)]
*  And Americans have had enough. Americans are saying, hands-off. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=105.0s)]
*  You know, it's interesting for all of our Canadian viewers. You know, the expression is elbows up in Canada. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=109.0s)]
*  And here, as there's this hostile takeover of our federal government, it's hands-off. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=114.0s)]
*  It's hands-off of what you're doing to Social Security, to Medicaid, to federal government. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=119.0s)]
*  Hands-off of women's reproductive rights. Hands-off of treating workers like crap. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=124.0s)]
*  And again, we are going to cover it here at the Midas Touch Network. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=129.0s)]
*  I want to bring in Rana Epting, the move-on executive director. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=132.0s)]
*  Now, Rana, you are, your organization is one of many organizations that are going to be leading these peaceful protests today. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=137.0s)]
*  I want to give all of our viewers all the information they need to know about this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=146.0s)]
*  So can you tell us about today's protests and where they're happening, what this is about and what they need to know? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=151.0s)]
*  Yeah, happy to. Thanks for having me, Ben. Yeah, today is a big day. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=159.0s)]
*  We've got over 1,300 activations, protests, rallies, all different types of ways of folks coming out to make sure their voices are heard, to do exactly what you said. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=165.0s)]
*  Demand that Trump and Musk and the Republicans keep their hands off of the things that we hold so dear in this country, like Social Security, Medicaid, education, jobs, you know, and like stop and stop ruining our economy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=177.0s)]
*  I mean, it's all these things that we're seeing coming out of this Trump-Musk administration that are really gutting the fabric of our society, our social safety net, our economy as a whole. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=194.0s)]
*  They're attacking our rights to free speech, our freedoms. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=205.0s)]
*  And folks have had enough. You saw those protests, those reels you just showed earlier. That's exactly the energy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=210.0s)]
*  It's intense. It's real. It's authentic. And it's persistent. Like folks aren't going home. They're continuing to show up. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=217.0s)]
*  And we've had over 2,000 actions all across the country since Donald Trump stepped back into the White House in January. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=225.0s)]
*  And today is really about all of us that have been coming out to make our voices heard. We're doing it in one day together. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=234.0s)]
*  You know, and we've got 1,300 events in all 50 states in some cities. Like you can go to handsoff2025.com and you can find an event near you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=242.0s)]
*  In some places, folks are trying to decide between, do I go to an event 30 minutes away or 10 minutes away or five minutes away? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=252.0s)]
*  So there is a lot happening. People have had enough. They are fed up. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=261.0s)]
*  They're not going to sit at home and they're going to make sure that they come together in massive numbers to say in one voice, hands off of everything, hands off of our rights, our freedoms, our services, you name it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=266.0s)]
*  You know, I think about these images we've been seeing internationally to Putin backed regimes, whether it's the Viktor Orban regime in Hungary. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=281.0s)]
*  And we've seen, you know, in Budapest, you know, started out tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands and then literally millions of people in the street. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=292.0s)]
*  We've seen that in Belgrade with the Putin backed regime there. We've seen it in Tbilisi in Georgia, country of Georgia. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=302.0s)]
*  People there getting close to, you know, 200 days of protests against the Putin backed regime there. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=311.0s)]
*  I think authoritarian regimes want to quash all oppositions. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=317.0s)]
*  Trump and Musk were talking about a shock and awe plan where they wanted to capture the media, where they wanted to capture all levels of government. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=322.0s)]
*  You think about synchronization, which was what was talked about, you know, with when Germany was taken over in the 40s, Trump wanted to take over everything kind of right away. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=332.0s)]
*  But it seems now the resistance grows each and every day. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=345.0s)]
*  And it seems he's golfing right now. He's as he crashed the economy, he's doing Saudi backed live golf tournaments. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=350.0s)]
*  And so it seems that it's growing. I mean, do you expect this hands off to be the start of kind of many more? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=358.0s)]
*  I said I think we're going to see a summer of democracy with protests in the millions. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=366.0s)]
*  But to me, this one today really kind of kicks off with all the energy we've seen and we sprint to that democracy summer. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=371.0s)]
*  What are you seeing? Look, as long as Trump and Musk and Vance and Republicans and all their friends continue to threaten the lives and livelihoods and rights of the American people here in this country, people are just going to get more and more pissed. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=379.0s)]
*  Right. So it's up to them. They can listen to the people that they're supposed to represent and take a step back and slow their role and really think about how do they want to govern in a way that builds trust with the people of this country? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=395.0s)]
*  Or they can continue to steamroll forward and try to govern through fear. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=411.0s)]
*  But one thing that's very clear, the people that are showing up, the people that are taking action, the people that are leaning and are engaged, we are not afraid. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=415.0s)]
*  We are stronger in numbers. We're not going anywhere. This is our country, too. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=424.0s)]
*  And we're not giving up on it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=428.0s)]
*  So if someone's watching this right now this morning and they say, I really want to go, I want to get out there. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=431.0s)]
*  I want to do something. What do they do? Where do they look up to find out if there is a hands off protest near them? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=439.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the good news is there probably is an event near you. Go to HandsOff2025.com and you can search for an event near you. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=447.0s)]
*  If there isn't one, there are plenty of other opportunities. Take action. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=455.0s)]
*  We'll be organizing and supporting people to organize events during Congressional recess over the month of August. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=459.0s)]
*  And we're also going to be doing other national days of action throughout the next couple of months. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=466.0s)]
*  So please do join with us. You can also go to MoveOn.org. You can sign up. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=472.0s)]
*  MoveOn is really designed to give people opportunity to take action together in timely moments. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=476.0s)]
*  And that's kind of why we exist. We want to help support folks, give folks information and the tools they need to make their voices heard by those that are elected to represent them. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=483.0s)]
*  You know, it's incredible that this is a grassroots movement, people starting their own chapters, letting other people know where to go. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=493.0s)]
*  And I think this is only going to get bigger. So we'll be there throughout the day. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=503.0s)]
*  We'll have people embedded with you, try to get us the content, and we'll make sure we use our distribution hub here to show this country and the world what's really going on. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=507.0s)]
*  I know a lot of people saying, we wish corporate news covered this more. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=520.0s)]
*  We wish other people focused more on this because this is big and they feel that it's not being covered enough. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=524.0s)]
*  Well, the good news is that this is a people power network that you all helped build. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=529.0s)]
*  And we're going to make sure we cover it here. So, Ronna Epting, thank you for the work in helping organize this. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=534.0s)]
*  Thank you to all the other groups out there, the labor unions and all the other nonprofits and all the other grassroots groups and everybody out there who is on the ground. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=539.0s)]
*  Y'all are the real heroes today. And thank you for everything. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=548.0s)]
*  And thanks for joining us and letting us know what's going down. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zMEH3VMPFY&t=552.0s)]
