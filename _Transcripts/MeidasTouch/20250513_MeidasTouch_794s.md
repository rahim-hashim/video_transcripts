# Republicans STUNNED by SHOCK LOSSâ€¦in NEBRASKA?!
**MeidasTouch:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg)
*  Republicans just suffered a stunning, shocking, and decisive defeat in a critical [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=0.0s)]
*  mayor's race, showing the unpopularity of Donald Trump and the overall MAGA brand. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=7.96s)]
*  In of all places, Omaha, Nebraska, the longest serving Republican incumbent [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=14.68s)]
*  mayor in the entire country. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=21.64s)]
*  Mayor Jean Stothert just lost her mayor's seat to the Democratic candidate, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=24.959999999999997s)]
*  John Ewing Jr. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=32.2s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=34.36s)]
*  Omaha, Nebraska, the Democratic candidate will go on to win and get this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=35.12s)]
*  It is now a 20 point swing from the last election where Jean Stothert, the prior [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=40.6s)]
*  mayor who just lost, cruised to an easy victory. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Now, again, this shows the unpopularity of the MAGA brand. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Now, why am I saying that? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=56.04s)]
*  Because former mayor Stothert was running on a platform closely tied to all of the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=57.64s)]
*  MAGA talking points, anti-trans. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=64.8s)]
*  She kept on talking about bathrooms and the people of Omaha, Nebraska are like, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=67.72s)]
*  talk about what matters to us. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=73.16s)]
*  Stop bullying marginalized communities. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=75.44s)]
*  And now mayor elect John Ewing Jr. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=78.32s)]
*  He was talking about issues like potholes. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=81.4s)]
*  He was talking about issues like health care. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=84.24s)]
*  He was talking about issues like jobs. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=86.64s)]
*  He was talking about issues like infrastructure. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  He was talking about issues like how the MAGA Republicans have engaged in a hostile [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=91.88s)]
*  takeover of our government, which has now trickled down to destroy local governments [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=97.0s)]
*  and affect local jobs and strip people of health coverage and access to social [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=103.52s)]
*  security offices in places like Omaha. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=109.24s)]
*  So I want to show you the moment right here where John Ewing Jr., the Democratic [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=112.6s)]
*  candidate, went on to win. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=117.8s)]
*  He's going to win by about seven points. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=119.32s)]
*  Again, a 20 point swing from the last race that took place where former mayor Jean [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=121.2s)]
*  Stothert went on to win the race in 2021. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=127.96000000000001s)]

*  city blue for the first time in 12 years. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=265.28s)]
*  Stothert ended her campaign pushing anti-trans bathroom bans. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=268.84s)]
*  Voters rejected it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=274.0s)]
*  And you had ads like this from the Democratic Party, the Nebraska Democrats, smart ads [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=275.84s)]
*  like this. Jean is focused on potties. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=281.84s)]
*  John is focused on fixing potholes, actually getting things done for the American people [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=285.64s)]
*  and not focused on all of these magr Republican distractions and bullying of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=292.08s)]
*  marginalized communities. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=297.04s)]

*  of people's minds, including potholes all over Omaha. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=303.64000000000004s)]
*  Ewing will make lives better by focusing on issues that impact all of us. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=307.8s)]
*  Jean Stothert and her allies are sending hateful mail and pushing creepy bathroom [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=312.28000000000003s)]

*  Democrat John Ewing Jr. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=329.35999999999996s)]
*  just turned Omaha blue, defeating the longest serving GOP mayor in the country and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=330.67999999999995s)]
*  becoming the city's first black mayor in history. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=335.44s)]

*  have deep seated concern about President Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=381.8s)]

*  Play this clip. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  We were the leader of the free world, but it appears to many leaders [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=570.0s)]
*  and people all over to include Republicans in Nebraska. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=573.5600000000001s)]
*  That this administration is walking away from that legacy that was built by [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=577.08s)]
*  Ike Eisenhower and all these presidents and really a capstone of Ronald Reagan, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=580.8000000000001s)]
*  peace through strength and building these close alliances. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=585.84s)]
*  And we are undermining that legacy right now. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=588.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm not interested in a foreign policy that is totally built on realism [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=592.1600000000001s)]
*  or transactionalism, where it's just what do we have in it for us? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=597.2800000000001s)]
*  I believe in having a foreign policy that's a mix of realism, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=601.5600000000001s)]
*  protecting our country and idealism, where we're the leaders standing for freedom, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=605.16s)]
*  free markets, rule of law. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=609.76s)]
*  And we got it. We got to be clear eyed, but also have moral clarity. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=612.0s)]
*  Putin invaded Ukraine. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=616.2s)]
*  He's murdered all of us, the political opponents. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=618.32s)]
*  He tried to kill a previous Ukrainian prime minister. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=620.52s)]
*  He's bombing cities. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=623.48s)]
*  He's ramped up the bombing of cities. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=625.08s)]
*  Now, I talked about how Gene Stothert, the former mayor, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=626.96s)]
*  was using all of this magma messaging. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=631.32s)]
*  One mailer from a political action group supporting Stothert [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=633.8s)]
*  grabbed attention for bringing up transgender policies. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=637.8s)]
*  Stothert brings up the issues in her own television ads all the time. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=641.4799999999999s)]
*  Ewing stands with radicals who want to allow boys and girls sports. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=645.7199999999999s)]
*  That's one of the things that Stothert was running on. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=650.0s)]
*  Ewing said nobody's ever brought that question up. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=652.5999999999999s)]
*  So I believe it's a made up issue by Gene Stothert and the Republican Party, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=654.8399999999999s)]
*  that people were not abying these culture war issues. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=658.7199999999999s)]
*  Let me give you some facts about John Ewing, Jr. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=662.16s)]
*  with over four decades of unwavering commitment to public service. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=664.8399999999999s)]
*  John Ewing's extensive background in law enforcement and community involvement [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=668.8s)]
*  has profoundly impacted Omaha. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=673.0799999999999s)]
*  His leadership as Douglas County Treasurer and his deep roots [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=675.24s)]
*  and local community service highlights his readiness to serve as your next mayor. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=678.7199999999999s)]
*  Here are some photos of him right here. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=683.12s)]
*  Here's a statement that came out from the Nebraska Democrats before [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=686.16s)]
*  the Stothert campaign was running misleading ads regarding John Ewing's record and agenda. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=689.72s)]
*  While former mayor Stothert continues to use the same tired Republican [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=694.32s)]
*  playbook to distract voters with culture wars like focusing on bathrooms. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=697.96s)]
*  John Ewing continues to focus on real issues that impact people's pockets, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=702.36s)]
*  the endless potholes, new economic development and housing that will help [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=706.36s)]
*  Omahans, not Gene's big donors. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=710.36s)]
*  Ultimately, Gene would rather focus on potties while John focuses on fixing potholes. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=713.52s)]
*  Under her leadership, the Omaha Police Department has skewed its numbers on new hires. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=719.2s)]
*  But the bottom line remains, Omaha has failed to recruit 100 officers. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=723.96s)]
*  People were commenting on Gene Stothert's ads as such. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=728.6800000000001s)]
*  These Gene Stothert ads are laughable. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=732.48s)]
*  She must be getting desperate with the bathroom and male and women sports bullshit. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=734.88s)]
*  What the F does a mayor of Omaha have to do with this? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=739.0400000000001s)]
*  And then as she was getting closer to election day, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=743.6800000000001s)]
*  she tried to backtrack and move away from a lot of these Trump messages. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=746.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm not with Trump, but the voters of Omaha, Nebraska, were not buying it, folks. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=750.64s)]
*  They were not buying it at all. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=756.52s)]
*  So a incredible victory there, you see from [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=758.64s)]
*  the Democratic candidate, John Ewing Jr. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=763.0799999999999s)]
*  And again, I think this is a major sign of what's to come across the country. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfeFlbBUg&t=765.7199999999999s)]
