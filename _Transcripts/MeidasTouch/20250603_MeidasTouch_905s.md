# Musk THROWS Trump UNDER BUS and TRASHES Budget
**MeidasTouch:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g)
*  Donald Trump and Mike Johnson just got thrown under the bus and trashed by none other than [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk who came out strongly against the disastrous budget bill Elon Musk posted on [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  ex-formerly Twitter, I'm sorry but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive outrageous pork [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=16.16s)]
*  filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=24.32s)]
*  You know you did wrong. You know it. So Elon Musk basically saying shame on you Donald Trump, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  shame on you, Mike Johnson. I'm out. I'm out of the administration and I am wagging my finger [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=40.8s)]
*  and I am making it public that I am here to tank this disastrous budget bill. Elon Musk continues [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=48.0s)]
*  and he posts, it will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to 2.5 trillion [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=56.0s)]
*  dollars and burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt to which [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=64.64s)]
*  MAGA Republican Congress member Thomas Massey posted, he's right and then Elon Musk responded, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=72.0s)]
*  it is simple math. Elon Musk then posts, Congress is making America bankrupt. Then Marjorie Taylor [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  Green makes a post saying she just uncovered a provision in the budget deal that makes her future [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=89.28s)]
*  vote a no unless it gets removed. She writes, full transparency. I did not know about this section on [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=96.96s)]
*  pages 278 to 279 of the budget bill that strips states of the right to make laws or regulate AI [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=104.55999999999999s)]
*  for 10 years. I am adamantly opposed to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=114.0s)]
*  voted no if I had known this was in there. We have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=120.32s)]
*  10 years and giving it free rein and tying states hands is potentially dangerous. This needs to be [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=126.8s)]
*  stripped out in the Senate. When the bill comes back to the House for approval after Senate changes, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=133.28s)]
*  I will not vote for it with this in it. Our editor in chief Ron Filipkowski goes, apparently Marge [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=138.96s)]
*  didn't read the bill before she voted on it. We read the bill here on the Midas Touch Network. We [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=147.44s)]
*  called out that provision among many others. Senator Bernie Sanders goes, Musk is right. This [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=154.32s)]
*  bill is a disgusting abomination. We shouldn't give $664 billion in tax breaks to the 1%. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=161.76s)]
*  We shouldn't throw 13.7 million people off of Medicaid. We shouldn't cut $290 billion [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=171.6s)]
*  from programs to feed the hungry. Let's defeat this disgusting abomination. Our editor in chief [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=179.84s)]
*  Ron Filipkowski writes, all the radical left Marxists like Rand Paul, Ron Johnson, and Elon Musk [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  now oppose Trump and Mike Johnson's budget bill. Let me take you inside the Capitol building where [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=195.28s)]
*  Maga Mike Johnson was asked to respond about Elon Musk saying this whole entire bill needs to go [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=202.08s)]
*  into the garbage. A very defensive Maga Mike Johnson here play this clip. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=210.88000000000002s)]
*  We applauded all the work they've done with DOJ in identifying fraud, waste, and abuse in the government. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=232.08s)]
*  It's a very important service that's been performed and we're so excited about it we're now in the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  process of codifying them. As you all know the administration has qualified and quantified the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  fraud, waste, and abuse that they found in DOJ. They're sending it to us to codify and that's what [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  we'll be doing with the rescissions package and the appropriations process and so that's something [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  we're very excited about. But with all due respect my friend Elon is terribly wrong about the one big [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  beautiful bill. We had a long conversation yesterday he and I spoke for I think more than 20 minutes on [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=260.32s)]
*  the telephone and I stole the health and virtues of the bill. He seemed to understand that. We had a [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  very friendly conversation about it and I told him that we're achieving not only all of our priorities, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=270.8s)]
*  all the promises we made on the campaign trail, all the America First Agenda wrapped into this [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=276.24s)]
*  legislation. We're also achieving the top line on this is two very important things. We're making [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=280.0s)]
*  permanent a massive tax cut and we are making a massive reduction in spending. 1.6 trillion dollars [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=285.28s)]
*  is the calculation. I've said this many times I'll be saying it until we get this thing over the line. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  This is the most amount of money that any government has ever saved on planet earth in a piece of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=297.84s)]
*  legislation ever. It's a very important first start. Elon is missing it okay and it's not personal. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=302.08s)]
*  I know that the the EV mandate very important to him that is going away because the government [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=309.52s)]
*  should not be subsidizing these things as part of the Green New Deal and I know that has an [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=314.56s)]
*  effect on his business and I look at that. We talked about the ramp down period on that and [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=318.48s)]
*  how that should be duly considered by Congress but for him to come out and hand the whole bill [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=323.36s)]
*  is to be just very disappointing, very surprising in light of the conversation I had with him yesterday. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=328.56s)]
*  Let's stay in the Capitol building for a moment and let's take a look at what the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=334.4s)]
*  um MAGA Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune has to say about it. A reporter asks [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=339.84s)]
*  Majority Leader Thune in the Senate, Senator you said that you were worried about Democrats criticizing [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=348.08s)]
*  this budget bill but we're hearing Republicans criticizing it and now Elon Musk is your biggest [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=354.88s)]
*  enemy and opponent. What do you have to say about that? Play the clip. You criticize the Democrats [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=361.52s)]
*  saying they're going to fight against this with everything they've got. That doesn't seem to be [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=367.12s)]
*  your problem. Elon Musk seems to be your problem. Absolutely torching this bill here saying everybody [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=370.32s)]
*  who voted for that should be ashamed? Well look we um we obviously respect everything that Elon did [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=375.12s)]
*  with Doge. On this particular issue we have a difference of opinion and I think it's rooted [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=382.24s)]
*  in the fact that he's accepting the CBO assumptions that are built upon a static scoring assessment [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=388.16s)]
*  of the effect, the macroeconomic effect, growth effect that these changes will have on our economy [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=395.35999999999996s)]
*  and all the modeling that we've seen suggests that the changes that are being made in the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=401.67999999999995s)]
*  tax policy particularly making permanent bonus depreciation, interest deductibility, R&D expensing [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=406.88s)]
*  are going to lead to significant growth and you couple the growth with the biggest spending [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=412.32s)]
*  reduction in American history and you will see a reduction not an increase in the deficit. So we [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=417.52s)]
*  have a difference of opinion. He's entitled to that opinion. We're going to proceed full speed. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=423.12s)]
*  Now here's what they were reporting on Fox about what went down. They showed [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  MAGA Mike Johnson and then they commented on it. Here's what they were just showing on Fox [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=434.16s)]
*  moments ago. Let's play it. Yeah let me let me say this. It's very disappointing. Okay I've come to [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=438.72s)]
*  consider Elon a good friend. He's obviously a very intelligent person and he's done a lot of great [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=445.36s)]
*  work. With all due respect my friend Elon is terribly wrong about the one big beautiful bill. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=450.24s)]
*  So what did Elon say about it? He said I'm sorry but I just can't stand it anymore. There's massive [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=456.64s)]
*  outrageous pork filled congressional spending bill is disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=460.64s)]
*  for it. You know you did wrong. You know it. Tell us how you really feel. Leaves the white house and [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK1jWNMqf6g&t=465.6s)]
