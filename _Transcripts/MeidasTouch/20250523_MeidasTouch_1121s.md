# WHOA! Press Sec JUST BLEW Trump Immunity with BLUNDER
**MeidasTouch:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M)
*  Donald Trump's press secretary, Caroline Levitt, just threw him under the bus, and I don't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=0.0s)]
*  even think she even realized it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=4.96s)]
*  And it's on some serious issues, potentially voiding Donald Trump's claim towards presidential [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=7.0s)]
*  immunity as it relates to his shady conduct relating to the dollar sign Trump meme coin. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Let me explain what went down. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=21.86s)]
*  Of course, you know by now, last night in Virginia, Donald Trump hosted the individuals [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=23.32s)]
*  or entities that had the most money invested in the Trump meme coin. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=29.76s)]
*  In other words, the people who put the most money into Donald Trump's pocket bought private [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=35.0s)]
*  access with Donald Trump in Virginia. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=40.82s)]
*  Now Donald Trump's press secretary, Caroline Levitt, was asked about this massive grift [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  because it kind of seems like it's illegal, duh. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=49.64s)]
*  And what her response was is that this is what Donald Trump is doing on his personal [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=53.96s)]
*  time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=58.88s)]
*  She goes, that's his personal time because specifically the individual who was asking [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=59.88s)]
*  Caroline Levitt at the press conference said, well, if you all care about transparency, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=64.08s)]
*  which you claim you do, which by the way, we all know that they absolutely don't, do [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=68.84s)]
*  you plan to release the list of individuals Donald Trump is meeting with who own all of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=72.4s)]
*  his meme coin so we can see which foreign nationals may be trying to bribe the president [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=79.04s)]
*  of the United States? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=85.38s)]
*  Who's giving Donald Trump money for this quid pro quo access? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  And she goes, well, we don't have to release the list because it's his personal time, not [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=91.44s)]
*  his presidential time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=96.48s)]
*  Now that's an outrageous thing to say, but that's going to backfire in Donald Trump's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=97.68s)]
*  face because when you look at the United States Supreme Court ruling on the concept of absolute [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=102.72s)]
*  presidential immunity, the Supreme Court, as horrible as that ruling was where they [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=109.06s)]
*  said Donald Trump was entitled to absolute presidential immunity for his official acts [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=114.0s)]
*  regarding the January 6th insurrection and his attempts to overthrow the results of the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=119.08s)]
*  2020 election. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=123.76s)]
*  They did say that his private conduct and conduct that is purely quote personal time [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=125.38s)]
*  would not be subject to any absolute immunity and the president can be sued and or have [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=132.04s)]
*  criminal charges brought against him for that conduct. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=139.12s)]
*  Now, Tim Miller wrote the first post in response to Caroline Levitt's statement where he says, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=143.04s)]
*  presidents don't get personal time. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=150.0s)]
*  There's not like a magic suit you wear when you are doing official business and one where [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=152.64s)]
*  you are just Donald from Queens. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=157.34s)]
*  But our friend George Conway, a superstar lawyer, pointed out, actually, Tim, it's fine. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=159.98s)]
*  If Trump is saying he's doing something on his personal time, then that obviously means [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=168.1s)]
*  he's not acting within what the Supreme Court calls the outer perimeter of his official [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=173.1s)]
*  responsibility, which in turn means he's not immune from criminal prosecution. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=178.85999999999999s)]
*  Good work, Caroline. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=185.18s)]
*  You just blew it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=186.54s)]
*  You threw Trump under the bus and now he could be susceptible at some later time to criminal [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=187.54s)]
*  prosecution for his conduct if indeed crimes are demonstrated. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=193.36s)]
*  So why don't we take a look at the Supreme Court ruling so you don't just hear me blabber [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  and give my commentary. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=203.16000000000003s)]
*  You know, I like to read the opinions. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=204.96s)]
*  So here's what the Supreme Court said from its October term of 2023 in the case of Trump, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  the United States turned to page four. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  As for a president's unofficial acts, there is no immunity. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=215.32000000000002s)]
*  Although presidential immunity is required for official acts to ensure that the president's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=219.34s)]
*  decision making is not distorted by the threat of future litigation stemming from those actions, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=223.8s)]
*  that concern does not support immunity for unofficial conduct. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=228.9s)]
*  The separation of powers does not bar a prosecution predicated on the president's unofficial acts. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=233.78s)]
*  The first step in deciding whether a former president is entitled to immunity from a particular [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=240.58s)]
*  prosecution is to distinguish his official from unofficial actions. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=246.36s)]
*  In this case, no court thus far has drawn that distinction in general or with respect [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=251.18s)]
*  to the conduct alleged in particular, it is therefore incumbent upon the court to be mindful [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=256.56s)]
*  that it is a court of final review and not first view. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=261.98s)]
*  Critical threshold issues in this case are how to differentiate between a president's [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=266.14s)]
*  and unofficial actions and how to do so with respect to the indictments, extensive and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=272.7s)]
*  detailed allegations covering a broad range of conduct. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=278.28s)]
*  The court offers guidance on those issues. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  And as you go to page 29, I guess here's some of that guidance. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=285.76s)]
*  There may however be context in which the president notwithstanding the prominence of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=289.0s)]
*  his position speaks in an unofficial capacity, perhaps as a candidate for office or party [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=293.52s)]
*  leader. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=299.48s)]
*  To the extent that may be the case, objective analysis of quote content, form and context [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=300.48s)]
*  will necessarily form the inquiry. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  But there is not always a clear line between the president's personal and official affairs. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=310.66s)]
*  The analysis therefore must be fact specific and may prove to be challenging. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=316.62s)]
*  Well, it doesn't seem to be all that challenging here. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  And it seems that that Donald Trump was actually a little worried when Caroline Levitt said [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=326.36s)]
*  this is his personal time, because about an hour after she made those statements, Donald [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  Trump made the following social media posts because I bet you a lawyer told him you could [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=338.16s)]
*  be absolutely screwed by what she said. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=343.36s)]
*  So you should post something. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  So when Donald Trump posted this, my view was a lawyer told him to post this. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=347.88s)]
*  So he posts heading to the crypto dinner in Virginia in a little while. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=352.92s)]
*  The USA is dominating in crypto, Bitcoin, etc. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=358.24s)]
*  And we're going to keep it that way. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=362.52000000000004s)]
*  Exclamation point. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=364.56s)]
*  Now, we know that Trump's personal meeting on his personal time with personal or entity [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=365.56s)]
*  holders of the Trump meme coin of the Trump crypto has nothing to do with the United States [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=372.8s)]
*  of America. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=379.3s)]
*  But you see here that he's trying to frame this as this is going to help the United States [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=380.4s)]
*  of America leading in crypto when this is all about Donald Trump's personal grift and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=385.32s)]
*  or bribes. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=391.2s)]
*  So why don't you judge the fact specific analysis for yourself? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=393.0s)]
*  Why don't we conduct what a future hypothetical Supreme Court or federal court, how they would [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=397.64s)]
*  look at it, shall we? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  So as a lawyer, let me share with you the exhibits. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=404.0s)]
*  So exhibit A is Caroline Levitt referring to Donald Trump doing this Bitcoin or meme [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=407.96s)]
*  coin meeting with the top holders of his meme coin as personal time. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=415.28s)]
*  Judge for yourself if based on the Supreme Court ruling, this is official or unofficial [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=421.82s)]
*  conduct. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=426.52s)]
*  It seems pretty clear that this would be unofficial conduct. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=427.52s)]
*  Let's play the clip. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=430.74s)]
*  You guys are very proud of your record on transparency. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=431.74s)]
*  I have two transparency related questions for you. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=434.44s)]
*  On the president's dinner tonight, will the White House commit to making a list of the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=437.28s)]
*  attendees public so people can see who's paying for that kind of access to the president? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=441.14s)]
*  Well, as you know, Gareth, this question has been raised with the president. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=445.96s)]
*  I have also addressed the dinner tonight. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=449.64s)]
*  The president is attending it in his personal time. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=451.4s)]
*  It is not a White House dinner. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=454.97999999999996s)]
*  It's not taking place here at the White House. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=456.44s)]
*  But certainly I can raise that question and try to get you an answer for it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=458.55999999999995s)]
*  Oh, you know, I had to do it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=461.84s)]
*  Four companies control over 80% of the US meat industry. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  China now controls the largest portion of US pork. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=469.8s)]
*  These companies are using mobster like tactics to crush American family farms. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=473.36s)]
*  And with the additives they're putting into our food, Americans are stuck with sketchy [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=479.68s)]
*  meat. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=484.88s)]
*  So what can we do about it? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=485.88s)]
*  Let me tell you about a company that's coming up swinging on behalf of American family farms [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=486.88s)]
*  and your family's food security. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=491.68s)]
*  It's called Moink. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=494.08000000000004s)]

*  Now let's learn a little bit more about this meeting that Donald Trump did. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=542.66s)]
*  Profits made, profits kept as Carl Keaton said. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=548.18s)]
*  Not promises made, promises kept because Donald Trump has blown all of those. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=551.5799999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=556.38s)]
*  I mean, housing is less affordable, groceries and prices in general are up and not down. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=557.38s)]
*  There's no peace in Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=563.5s)]
*  Donald Trump has screwed our bond markets and has made the United States a laughing [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=565.9399999999999s)]
*  of the entire world. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=570.62s)]
*  And the world is less safe with wars going on pretty much everywhere at this point. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=572.18s)]
*  So you have Trump's crypto dinner cost over $1 million per seat on average. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=577.18s)]
*  In total, 220 winners of the contest who are attending this dinner last night spent $394 [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=583.5s)]
*  million on Trump's official cryptocurrency. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=592.34s)]
*  Now there's other griffs as well like Trump's Mar-a-Lago and Ben Minster grift, which now [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=596.66s)]
*  costs $1 million a year in membership fees. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=601.5799999999999s)]
*  Then Donald Trump claims that Mar-a-Lago is both his residence but not a personal property. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=606.38s)]
*  So he pays less property tax on it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=612.66s)]
*  So he says it's a club where he lives and therefore it's not a personal residence. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=615.9399999999999s)]
*  So that's the way Donald Trump tries to avoid paying taxes. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=621.7s)]
*  You take a look right here, what Donald Trump is also doing. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=627.5s)]
*  He inked a crypto deal with Pakistan. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=631.9000000000001s)]
*  Pakistan inked a deal with crypto company in which Trump's kin has a 60% stake. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=635.98s)]
*  There's another Trump entity that Pakistan's government invested in. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=642.86s)]
*  Remember what Donald Trump though said back on July of 2019 where he said, I'm not a fan [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=649.0600000000001s)]
*  of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money and whose value is highly volatile [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=655.5s)]
*  and based on thin air. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=661.4200000000001s)]
*  Unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=663.1800000000001s)]
*  activities. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=671.74s)]
*  You don't say Donald because why don't we take a look at who else is on your guest list? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=672.86s)]
*  I'm interested. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=678.62s)]
*  Is there a guy named Justin Sun who's going to be there? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=680.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that tracks. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=684.54s)]
*  Justin Sun whose digital currency network is popular with the crypto industry's criminal [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=686.54s)]
*  underbelly is a top investor in Trump's meme coin. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=691.74s)]
*  This is being reported by the Wall Street Journal. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=696.18s)]
*  A crypto billionaire who feared arrest in the US returns to the US for dinner with its [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=698.7s)]
*  president Donald Trump. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=705.66s)]
*  Let's take a look at some more stories on Justin Sun right here. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=707.54s)]
*  The SEC charged him for market manipulation and fraud. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=712.02s)]
*  The DOJ was investigating him. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=715.74s)]
*  He invested in Trump backed crypto ventures. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=718.26s)]
*  The SEC paused his case and now last night he was at the Trump crypto dinner as the top [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=721.54s)]
*  holder of Trump's meme coin. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=727.5s)]
*  Can you say quid pro quo? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=730.74s)]
*  Do you know one way or the other? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=734.3399999999999s)]
*  I'll let you use your judgment there and decide for yourself. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=737.26s)]
*  Well here's how Senator Chris Murphy put it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=743.02s)]
*  He goes that Trump's meme coin is designed to facilitate corruption. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=746.7s)]
*  You can pay Trump secretly which gets you secret special access to the president. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=750.64s)]
*  If Trump's dinner with the top coin buyers was legit, he would release the list of attendees, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=755.58s)]
*  but it's corrupt so the list stays hidden. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=761.3000000000001s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=764.7s)]
*  Tonight Donald Trump will have a secret dinner and meeting with the 200 individuals who have [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=765.86s)]
*  spent the most money buying up his meme coin. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=774.22s)]
*  Donald Trump's meme coin has no value in and of itself. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=777.9000000000001s)]
*  Its only value is based upon how much demand exists for the meme coin. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=782.1400000000001s)]
*  He creates demand by essentially opening a channel for bribery. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=787.26s)]
*  If you buy his coin, the price goes up and he makes more money. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=793.38s)]
*  If you buy his coin, you get secret access to the president to be able to plead your [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=798.86s)]
*  case to be able to ask for preferential treatment. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=804.38s)]
*  And the extra benefit is no one will ever know that you bought the coin or that you [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=808.9s)]
*  got the private access. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=814.3s)]
*  And so it provides cover for the most corrupt, for the most compromised, for the worst of [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=817.14s)]
*  the worst to channel money to Donald Trump in order to get their private audience with [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=824.3s)]
*  him in order to plead their case for favorable treatment from the federal government or for [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=830.22s)]
*  investment from the US taxpayer. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=837.06s)]
*  Now a group that's called Our Resolution, they were there protesting Donald Trump's [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=839.98s)]
*  arrival and the arrival of these other shady characters in Virginia. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=846.2199999999999s)]
*  Here it is, Our Revolution greeting the grifter in chief and his crypto buyers as they arrive [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=851.78s)]
*  at Trump National Golf Club this evening to purchase influence with the presidency. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=859.5s)]
*  America is not for sale. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=864.9799999999999s)]
*  Well, that's the hopeful statement, but it does appear that America is for sale under [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=868.42s)]
*  the Trump regime. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=874.06s)]
*  Let's go ahead and play this clip. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=875.06s)]
*  Our democracy is becoming personal and ignored. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=876.06s)]
*  I'm here for a free-trade finance. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=879.06s)]
*  I'm here for a free-trade finance. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=882.06s)]
*  I'm here for a free-trade finance. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=885.06s)]
*  I'm here for a free-trade finance. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=888.06s)]
*  Now, let me also just remind you about this meme coin. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=891.06s)]
*  Donald Trump released it right before inauguration. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=895.06s)]
*  The price went up like crazy because what the hell's going on? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=899.3s)]
*  The president of the United States is using his influence to pump a shit coin and a lot [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=903.22s)]
*  of insiders knew, made a killing off it. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=909.22s)]
*  Lots of people started buying it. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=912.5600000000001s)]
*  About 55,000 wallets lost money and I think it was only a small fraction of that, somewhere [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=914.6s)]
*  between 20 and 100, I think that actually ended up making any money at all. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=924.36s)]
*  In other words, most of the people lost their money, got screwed while the insiders and [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=929.7s)]
*  rich people ended up getting richer. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=936.26s)]
*  Put all of that together and I want you to decide for yourself right here. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=940.38s)]
*  It's just interesting too, right? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=945.82s)]
*  Because Maga Mike was asked if he has concerns about Trump's business dealings a few weeks [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=947.38s)]
*  back. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=952.1s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=953.1s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=954.1s)]
*  Speaker, you are very critical of President Biden and his family's foreign business dealings. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=955.1s)]
*  You've supported an impeachment inquiry as a result of it. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=959.42s)]
*  Are you equally concerned about President Trump's family's business dealings, especially [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=962.54s)]
*  given the fact that he is in a region now where his family has billions of dollars in [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=966.5s)]
*  investments in Doha, Saudi Arabia and the fact that he has a crypto business now where [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=970.42s)]
*  he's auctioned off access to the White House for the highest bidder in his mean. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=975.5s)]
*  Look there are authorities that, police, executive branch, ethics rules, I'm not an expert in [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=980.14s)]
*  that. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=985.74s)]
*  My expertise is here in the house. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=986.74s)]
*  I will say that the reason that many people refer to the Bidens as the Biden crime family [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=987.86s)]
*  is because they were doing all this stuff behind curtains, but in the back rooms they [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=992.98s)]
*  were trying to conceal it and they repeatedly lied about it and they set up shell companies [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=996.66s)]
*  and the family was all engaged in getting all on the dole. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1000.54s)]
*  Whatever the President Trump is doing is out in the open. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1004.94s)]
*  They're not trying to conceal anything. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1007.7s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, the investment in the meme coin, those folks are not transparent. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1008.7s)]
*  We do not know who those people are. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1013.94s)]
*  I don't know anything about the meme coin thing. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1016.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1017.62s)]
*  I can just tell you that I mean President Trump has had nothing to hide. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1018.62s)]
*  He's very upfront about it and there are people who watch all the ethics of that. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1021.34s)]
*  But I mean, I've got to be concerned with running the House of Representatives and that's [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1026.5s)]
*  what I do. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1029.58s)]
*  Congress has oversight responsibility, but I think so far as I know, the ethics are all [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1030.58s)]
*  being followed. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1037.38s)]
*  So yes, sir. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1038.38s)]
*  Pretty, pretty pathetic MAGA Mike. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1039.38s)]
*  And I think we'll use that as the last clip here to contextualize this as the MAGA Republicans [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1041.3s)]
*  are passing a budget that's going to rip away the Medicaid of 14 million Americans, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1046.58s)]
*  also rip away Medicare from many Americans. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1052.26s)]
*  It's going to take away supplemental nutrition assistance programs, SNAP or food stamps [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1055.6999999999998s)]
*  from people. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZX_i7QnU2M&t=1060.54s)]
