# Trump in PANIC MODE as he Utterly FAILS IN PUBLIC
**MeidasTouch:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc)
*  Idiocracy was too charitable to the United States of America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=0.0s)]
*  Hat tip to Aaron Rupert for that quote right there. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=4.48s)]
*  Yep, the Trump idiocracy just made Janine Pirro the Fox host, the interim United States [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=7.12s)]
*  attorney for Washington, D.C. At the same time, Donald Trump fired his own interim FEMA director [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=15.84s)]
*  because the FEMA director said that he wanted to keep FEMA running as an agency. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=25.84s)]
*  In the Trump regime, if you try to defend your agency at all, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=33.28s)]
*  you get fired right away, and that's what happened here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=36.88s)]
*  Also, MAGA was having a meltdown about the new pope. Now known as Pope Leo XIV was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=40.88s)]
*  Cardinal Robert Prevost. He was from Chicago, is from Chicago, worked in Peru. MAGA is saying, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  this guy is so woke, he's the wokenest pope ever, he's too woke for them because [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  he's made public statements in posts before that said that migrants should be treated with dignity. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=62.4s)]
*  He said that JD Vance and Naib Bukheli, their statements about concentration camps in El [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=69.44s)]
*  Salvador and treatment of migrants was unacceptable to him. He came out in support of the Black [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=76.8s)]
*  community after the murder of George Floyd. So statements like that have MAGA very, very, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=83.84s)]
*  very upset. But of course, yesterday began with Donald Trump announcing a fake trade deal with [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=89.92s)]
*  the United Kingdom, who the United States already has a trade surplus with. So Donald Trump issued [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=97.52s)]
*  massive tariffs against the UK. Again, the United States has a trade surplus with the United Kingdom. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=107.36s)]
*  We only do about 2% of total trade with the United Kingdom. And so Donald Trump removed about 10 or [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  15% supposedly of that tariff. So there's still 10% tariffs against UK. And some of the tariffs [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=123.36s)]
*  were removed against like Range Rover and Land Rover. And so the arsonist really didn't even put [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=130.64s)]
*  out his own fire, but kind of pretended to. And we're all supposed to go, yay, Donald, good boy, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=136.16s)]
*  Donald. And the whole thing is so utterly ridiculous. And then they go through the whole [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=142.4s)]
*  charade where he lies and he goes, the deal I made today with the United Kingdom is great for [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=147.68s)]
*  our farmers and ranchers. It's also wonderful for the United Kingdom. Everybody benefits. That's the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  way it should be. You know, about 30 days ago or so, there was no restrictions with the United [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=158.88s)]
*  Kingdom. You place them on and now you partially remove that. That's not a deal. That's not even a [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  sub deal. It's not even a sub deal within a sub deal. Isn't a free trade agreement, which takes [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=175.2s)]
*  three years to negotiate? Why does corporate news baby this guy? Go, good job, Donald. You did a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=180.48s)]
*  deal. You did a deal. It's not a deal at all. By the way, I mean, this is what we're learning about [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  it too. The full and comprehensive trade deal between the US and the UK is no such thing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  They were rushing to try to get it through. They didn't even know what the terms were. Lots of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  people don't even know what the terms are now. The rush to demonstrate progress on deals reveals [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=203.28s)]
*  rising desperation within the administration to roll back tariffs before they hit GDP growth [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=208.8s)]
*  and inflation. I mean, they already are. Take a look at these three names side by side. Prime [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=215.68s)]
*  Minister Mark Carney of Canada, Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister, and right now, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=222.4s)]
*  Robert Prevost, Pope Leo XIV. All of them together. Lots of people are saying beats a reaction [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=230.08s)]
*  to Donald Trump. Even Donald Trump's own top religious advisor, this bishop, said that an [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  American pope, if one were to ever be announced, would indicate the United States' political [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=246.72000000000003s)]
*  decline. I think the Vatican was sending a strong message here. That's my theory right here. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=253.12s)]
*  And Hattip for the Courier for posting it with us over there. They did great research at the Courier. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=259.2s)]
*  So this guy, Bishop Robert Barron, sits on the White House's Committee on Religious Liberty. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=264.48s)]
*  Here's what they said. Cardinal George of Chicago of happy memory was one of my great mentors. He [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=271.2s)]
*  said, look, until America goes into political decline, there won't ever be an American pope. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=276.88s)]
*  His point was, if America is kind of running the world politically, culturally, economically, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=282.64s)]
*  they don't want America running the world religiously. So a sign of America's decline [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=288.32s)]
*  would be the moment the Vatican selected an American pope, an American pope who shows empathy, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=294.4s)]
*  supports migrants, supports equality. Now, the brother of the new pope, the guy from Chicago, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=302.4s)]
*  because the pope was from Chicago. He worked in Peru. Said, no, no, my brother hates Trump's [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  migrant policy. He's really against it. He goes, I don't know how far he's going to go, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=317.28s)]
*  but I can sure as hell tell you that my, maybe I shouldn't use that language there when I'm [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  talking about a pope, sorry. My bad. But he said, my brother certainly doesn't support these policies [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  at all. I'm sorry. Okay. So let's talk about the FEMA director, the interim FEMA director who Trump [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=334.96s)]
*  fired. I'm going to do a whole video on that this morning. The acting head of the Federal Emergency [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=342.23999999999995s)]
*  Management Agency, Cameron Hamilton, a big MAGA guy too, is out the day after he testified. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=346.88s)]
*  And he said that the agency, FEMA, that he led was vital and should not be eliminated, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=353.68s)]
*  disagreeing with President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary dog killer, Cristino. As Waldo [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=359.44s)]
*  Jack Queath says, one thing that Trump will not tolerate is the heads of agencies saying publicly [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  that their agency should exist. As I said, idiocracy is charitable to the United States [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=373.6s)]
*  of America. But folks, Ted Cruz and the MAGA Republicans were hard at work. Ted Cruz proposed [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  a bill to help military hurt by the vaccine mandate. That's the title. That's what he's [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  focused on right there. Hurt by the vaccine mandate, to be vaccinated for troop readiness. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=393.36s)]
*  I mean, what in the world is going on with our country right there? And by the way, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=399.04s)]
*  I'll talk to you more about the surge in general, Casey Means in a second, but I often get asked, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=405.6s)]
*  Ben, where do you do your research from and how do you find these clips and how do you find [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=410.72s)]
*  stories like this? Take a look at this one right here. I found this one on Blindspot, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=415.12s)]
*  which is run by Ground News, who happens to be a sponsor of the Midas Touch Network. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  I can see here on their Blindspot feature, which I use all the time, that this is being [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  almost exclusively covered by right-wing media and some center media, but no left-wing media is [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=428.56s)]
*  covering this. So I want to bring this to our attention so you see what's going on there. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=434.96s)]
*  So it's a great research tool, by the way, Ground News. I think it's essential nowadays to see [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=438.64s)]
*  through some of the double standards that exist in the media ecosphere. So if you want to know, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=444.0s)]
*  if you want to access it yourself, we've got a great discount for you too. Just go to ground.news [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=448.4s)]
*  slash MTN or scan the QR code right there. We're going to give our viewers 40% off Ground News's [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=453.68s)]
*  top-tier vantage plan, which will get you unlimited access to everything I've shown you and more. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=460.08s)]
*  Ground News is subscriber funded, so they don't rely on ads. That could also introduce bias and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=464.72s)]
*  subscribing supports our channel and their independent team working to keep the media [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=469.6s)]
*  transparent. A tip to Jordy for negotiating, my brother Jordy for negotiating that deal. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=473.68s)]
*  Ground.News, you get 40% off. Ground.News slash MTN and get 40% off Ground News top-tier [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=478.96s)]
*  vantage plan. Sweet. All right. Let's talk about, should we talk about Jeanine Pirro? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=485.52s)]
*  Should we talk more about Casey Means? Now let's first talk about someone else who Donald Trump [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=491.28s)]
*  fired, just to show you how despicable and dastardly this regime is. Trump just fired the first black [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=497.84s)]
*  person to serve as the Librarian of Congress. She has been in that position since 2016 and is [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=503.12s)]
*  the first professional librarian to hold the position since 1974. So a qualified black woman [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=509.36s)]
*  librarian, of course, that checks the boxes for Donald Trump to say termination. As Joe Morrell [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=516.8s)]
*  says, Congress member says, today Trump fired a patriotic public servant. The Librarian of Congress [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=523.28s)]
*  spent her entire career serving people from helping kids learn to read to protecting some [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=530.24s)]
*  of our nation's most precious treasures. She is an American hero. And apparently that's just a [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=536.48s)]
*  threat to Donald Trump. And then look, I think the American people see it. I gave a speech this week [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=541.52s)]
*  at the Milliken Institute. One of my main messages when I was asked, how is the Midas Touch Network [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=547.6s)]
*  connecting with audiences? I said, because we're speaking to human beings about human beings. And [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=553.28s)]
*  we can say this behavior by Donald Trump and Musk and Vance is just not right. I will not stand by [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=557.76s)]
*  idly to watch human beings here in America treat other human beings so cruelly. As I've said, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=565.2s)]
*  it's not a debate whether there's due process or not due process. There's due process, damn it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=571.28s)]
*  This is the United States of America. It's simple to me. We don't bully marginalized communities in [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=577.12s)]
*  the United States of America. We shouldn't do that. We shouldn't hate. We shouldn't spread all of [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  these lies all the time. We shouldn't attack our allies. We shouldn't just engage in this reckless [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=587.44s)]
*  and disastrous behavior. The lack of accountability, the immaturity, that's not okay at a human level. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=594.4000000000001s)]
*  That's not okay. And that's what I was telling the audience at the packed crowd I was speaking in [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=601.36s)]
*  front of. We just got to remember. We got to treat human beings nicely and just try to be good people. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  By the way, that's why Trump's net approval rating continues to plummet and plummet and plummet. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=610.96s)]
*  Because as he treats people cruelly, as he harms the economy, as he harms people's lives, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=616.5600000000001s)]
*  what are they focused on in the House? I mean, I showed you what Ted Cruz was doing on that ground [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  news research I was doing. But yeah, the US House is voting to all the Republicans vote to approve [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=630.4000000000001s)]
*  the legislation to rename the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of America. Yay. Yay, everybody. Yay. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=637.5200000000001s)]
*  I don't want to show any Trump videos in this today. I don't want to hear his voice this morning. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=644.32s)]
*  I'm not going to play the clip, but I'll tell you what he said. I just don't want to hear his voice [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=649.9200000000001s)]
*  this morning. Okay. Donald Trump said, you better go and buy stock now, manipulating the market. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=653.84s)]
*  And then Donald Trump said on port traffic, the lack of ships coming into Seattle, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=660.96s)]
*  Long Beach, even on the East Coast and Boston, he goes, when you say that ship volume slows down, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=669.36s)]
*  that's a good thing, not a bad thing. That means we're making money and we're not losing money. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=675.44s)]
*  No, Donald, it means the opposite. Going back to what I said before, it's like, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=680.8000000000001s)]
*  what are we talking about here? We know tariffs are bad. We know when ships don't arrive, that's bad. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=685.6s)]
*  Can we use common sense? Like, let's just be real. This is Donald Trump saying about COVID, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=692.32s)]
*  like a miracle, it's all going to go away. Inject yourself with bleach. He's doing it again [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=697.68s)]
*  in this manufactured recession that he's created. He's doing it again. He's always done this though. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=702.64s)]
*  If you go back to how he destroyed Atlantic City and he bankrupted his casinos back then, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=708.16s)]
*  remember he built three casinos right next to each other. He took out a huge loan and he was [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=714.0s)]
*  over leveraged. Everybody was saying, what are you doing? Why are you building three casinos? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=720.8s)]
*  You're going to bankrupt them. No, they're the biggest, most beautiful. They've got to be three. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=724.4s)]
*  And he bankrupted and everybody lost their jobs. Then he blamed the city and he blamed the workers [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=727.92s)]
*  and he makes money and he goes on to the next scam. That's why I call him the Ponzi scheme presidency. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=733.12s)]
*  That's why I call this the rug pull presidency. Finally, again, the theme of this video, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=738.8s)]
*  idiocracy was charitable to the United States of America. The movie Idiocracy. I'm like, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=745.1999999999999s)]
*  we're Idiocracy meets like Kim Jong Un meets the worst season of The Apprentice. I've said it before. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=751.92s)]
*  We're all non-consensual participants in this dystopian reality weird TV show, the worst episode [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=756.4799999999999s)]
*  of The Apprentice that's never aired that we don't want to be a part of. We just want to go about our [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=763.68s)]
*  lives. We want to spend time with our families. We want to be able to just go out and not think [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=767.52s)]
*  about this maniac making posts and behaving like a malignant narcissist at all times. That's what we [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=772.64s)]
*  want. So here's Laura Loomer, one of Donald Trump's top advisors calling Donald Trump's pick for [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=778.0s)]
*  surgeon general Casey means witchcraft, witchcraft. Trump nominated a witch doctor for surgeon general, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=784.08s)]
*  according to his other top advisor, Laura Loomer. You see the theme of this video. Idiocracy was [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=791.84s)]
*  charitable. Laura Loomer goes, this is arguably witchcraft. I want to know which one of Trump's [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=796.72s)]
*  geniuses chose a woman who literally talks to trees and spiritual mediums and who doesn't even [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=802.08s)]
*  have an active medical license to be the US surgeon general. She's right there. It's RFK [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=807.28s)]
*  Jr. But that's what the surgeon general believes. I would call her a witch doctor, but she doesn't [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=812.0s)]
*  even have a valid medical license. So I'm not going to call her a doctor. You have no idea how [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=818.0799999999999s)]
*  many texts I received from doctors who are members of Mar-a-Lago and Ben Minster who are like, what the [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=822.56s)]
*  F is this? It's honestly insane. I do not believe for one second that Donald Trump made this decision. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=827.1999999999999s)]
*  I refuse to believe it. So let's end this video with that. I refuse to believe it. She refuses [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=832.64s)]
*  to believe it. Maga cult members with mush brains refuse to believe it. I think they do, but they [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=839.6s)]
*  have this cognitive dissonance. Everyone, I refused to, he didn't post. Yes, it was posted on his [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=846.48s)]
*  account, but he didn't post it. Yes. What do you mean? Like when have we allowed a human being [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=851.68s)]
*  to behave outwardly like a freaking baby with shit in their diaper running around and behaving [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=860.88s)]
*  this way. And we're like, well, you know, the baby, no, it's an adult. It's a grown human being. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=871.4399999999999s)]
*  It's the lead. It's the presidency. What are we doing? What are we doing? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TatUo2hgOc&t=878.7199999999999s)]
