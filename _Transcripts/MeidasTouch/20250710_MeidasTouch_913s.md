# All HELL BREAKS LOOSE as Trump INVADES CA Farms
**MeidasTouch:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno)
*  All hell is breaking loose in California right now as a militarized ice is invading the farms [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=0.0s)]
*  in California. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=17.6s)]
*  They're in Ventura County, they're in Santa Barbara County, they're in Fresno County, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  they are in Tulare County. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=24.16s)]
*  They're going after farm workers who are picking blueberries, they're going after cannabis farmers. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=26.84s)]
*  They are in Ventura County in Oxnard going after a packing house at Boscovich Farms and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=34.16s)]
*  the owners there say absolutely we're not letting ice in. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=41.8s)]
*  We have mayors like the mayor of Paris who's out there saying stay at home if you're a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=45.36s)]
*  migrant, stay at home if you're a farmer. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=50.92s)]
*  These ice raids are brutalizing and tearing apart and ripping up the communities. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=53.36s)]
*  You saw that at the outset. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=59.12s)]
*  That was in Camarillo. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=60.44s)]
*  Let me show you another video of what was happening in Camarillo as a CBP helicopter, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=62.68s)]
*  a Customs and Border Patrol helicopter kind of lands and you'll see the huge militarized [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=69.44s)]
*  presence in Camarillo. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=75.6s)]
*  I'm going to show you some other videos of what's going on in Camarillo and then we're [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=77.56s)]
*  going to go and Camarillo is in Ventura County just for your geography. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=82.28s)]
*  Then we're going to go and talk about what was happening in Santa Barbara, what's happening [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=86.6s)]
*  in Tulare, what's happening in Fresno and elsewhere. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=90.24s)]
*  But watch what happens when the CBP helicopter lands. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=92.8s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=95.72s)]
*  ... who have showed up to vehemently protest what's going on here and just in the last [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=96.72s)]
*  few minutes Customs and Border Patrol helicopter has entered the seat here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  They are landing in the middle of the farm as we speak. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  It does appear that they were not planning to be here as long as they have been. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=108.72000000000001s)]
*  This helicopter that you're looking at here, guys, apparently just made a run over to Van [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=113.84s)]
*  Isle Airport for some cases of water, which is what they're bringing into the scene here. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=117.68s)]
*  There are a whole team of ICE agents at the farm. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=123.84s)]
*  There are other agents down there as well, as well as the National Guard Police, standing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=126.76s)]
*  guard and protecting Laguna Road as this enforcement action takes place right here going into hour [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=131.32s)]
*  number four this afternoon. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  Again, a major situation is spiring here in Camarillo. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=139.4s)]
*  Here's another view. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=142.72s)]
*  I'll just show you the B-roll here of what it looks like in Camarillo as these military [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  ICE officers, hundreds of them, roll in and start to terrorize the community there in [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=149.96s)]
*  Camarillo. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=157.68s)]
*  Take a look right here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=159.68s)]
*  Here is another shot of what's taking place. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=160.76s)]
*  Let's play this clip right here. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=164.8s)]
*  This is happening at Wood and Laguna, and you now see the military vehicles advancing [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=166.16s)]
*  despite those protesters trying to make a stance and trying to stop the military vehicle [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=170.84s)]
*  from continuing on. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=177.8s)]
*  And there's cameras rolling, cell phone cameras rolling. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=180.28s)]
*  And this group of people are really trying to get this military vehicle to stop, and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=185.36s)]
*  it doesn't appear that it will. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=189.84s)]
*  It is continuing to push forward, and now these, the people are moving away from, in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=193.96s)]
*  front of that military vehicle, which is a good thing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=201.72s)]
*  We don't want to see anyone get hurt. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=205.72s)]
*  But again, you see this grouping of military vehicles advancing toward the federal agents [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=209.52s)]
*  further down on the street. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=216.96s)]
*  And here you can see some community members who are really pissed and trying to slow down [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=218.6s)]
*  this convoy of ICE agents. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=223.64s)]
*  They're bringing in tanks, tanks, like they're turning our cities as if it was the American [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=226.04s)]
*  military in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  Look at the tanks and just look what's happening. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=235.32s)]
*  This is in Camarillo as well. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=237.2s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  Get out of there! [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=249.12s)]
*  Get out of there! [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=251.12s)]
*  Get out of there! [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=278.6s)]
*  Here's another view from Camarillo. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=299.6s)]
*  Let me show you right here. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=301.64000000000004s)]
*  We're literally running through the fields. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  They're shooting us through the fucking fields. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  They're shooting us and where's the fucking police? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=308.04s)]
*  Call 911! [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=310.48s)]
*  Now here's what the mayor of Paris, California had to say. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=311.48s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=318.24s)]
*  Paris is in Riverside County. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=319.24s)]
*  Just again for your geography here, play this clip. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  The city of Paris has received reports of ongoing ICE operations within the area. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=323.72s)]
*  We urge all residents to remain calm, stay indoors when possible, and know your rights. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=328.88s)]
*  Do not go out unless necessary. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  Stay at home and do not open the door to strangers. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=336.88s)]
*  This message is for awareness and safety. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  The city is committed to protecting the dignity and well-being of all our residents. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  Please stay safe and continue to monitor official city communications. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=347.28s)]
*  So then in Carpinteria, which is in Santa Barbara County, and again, this was happening [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  all throughout California, here's Congressman Salud Carbajal, who's the congressman of that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=355.64s)]
*  area in Carpinteria. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=362.8s)]
*  So he's denied access by ICE agents during one of the raids by ICE of a nearby location [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=365.08s)]
*  and of the farms there. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=373.76s)]
*  You can see, just take a look right here at the ICE agents, here, Congressman Carbajal, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=375.64s)]
*  you'll see that he tries to speak to some of the ICE agents and he's basically turned [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=381.24s)]
*  around. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=388.0s)]
*  Lots of people were injured, kids were injured based on some of these flash grenades that [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=389.0s)]
*  were being thrown at the crowd. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=393.18s)]
*  Here's Congressman Carbajal trying to, again, he's legally allowed to see what's going on [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=395.62s)]
*  in his congressional district, but America is run by a fascist dictatorship right now. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=401.18s)]
*  I can't even imagine what our international viewers are thinking of our country as I shike [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=406.18s)]
*  in on what our American viewers are thinking about. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=410.38s)]
*  But watch as the congressman is blocked by Donald Trump's Gestapo. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=412.3s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=416.66s)]
*  And we heard from congressmember Carbajal, who talks about going to Casitas Pass Road [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=423.18s)]
*  in Carpinteria after learning, in Santa Barbara County, after learning that ICE was conducting [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=452.94s)]
*  a militarized raid targeting the farm workers. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=458.34s)]
*  He goes, as a member of Congress, I had the right to conduct oversight, but I was denied [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=462.1s)]
*  entry. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=467.14s)]
*  Here's what happened. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=468.14s)]
*  Listen to his story here, play this clip. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=469.14s)]
*  I'm here at a nursery in Carpinteria where ICE just finished an ICE raid operation. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=470.54s)]
*  I got here, I got many calls from constituents, from social media, we saw what was happening, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=477.86s)]
*  and I came here to do my congressional oversight responsibilities. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=483.82s)]
*  When I got here, there was obviously a crowd of protests and it was overkill. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=487.82s)]
*  Over 50 ICE agents that were here and they were conducting this operation. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=492.26s)]
*  They were creating fear, anxiety, and intimidation. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=499.02s)]
*  They were dressed in military garb clothing, military grade weapons. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=501.98s)]
*  They were just creating an untenable incendiary circumstance where they could have got members [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=508.62s)]
*  of the public and themselves hurt. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=516.38s)]
*  They were pouring gasoline on the flames of this situation. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=518.78s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=523.38s)]
*  There was a child that was hurt. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=525.02s)]
*  They deployed in various flash devices and smoke devices. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=526.94s)]
*  Here's part of the shrapnel that came from one of those devices and it actually hurt [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=533.86s)]
*  a young child that was in the crowd. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=539.0600000000001s)]
*  This is deplorable. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=541.96s)]
*  This should not be happening on our soil. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=543.3800000000001s)]
*  Individual stress like military personnel on our soil. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=546.22s)]
*  We don't do that in America. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=550.12s)]
*  This is overkill. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=551.9000000000001s)]
*  This was ridiculous. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=552.9000000000001s)]
*  This was a bunch of crap. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=553.9000000000001s)]
*  Now I'm here to do our oversight. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=555.54s)]
*  They didn't let me through. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=557.38s)]
*  I saw other members of the public ride through here on bicycles and certainly they did not [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=558.74s)]
*  let me go through the perimeter line that they created. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=564.4599999999999s)]
*  Eventually they dispersed and that's why I'm here right now. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=568.66s)]
*  It's my understanding they apprehended 10 out of the 12 individuals that were here. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=573.3s)]
*  I got that from the owner of this nursery, not from the ICE agents. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=577.5s)]
*  Nobody would speak to me. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh42UuETno&t=582.26s)]
