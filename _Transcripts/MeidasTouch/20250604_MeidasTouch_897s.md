# Trump STUNNED into SILENCE as Bill GETS SKEWERED
**MeidasTouch:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY)
*  Talk about putting the dagger in and twisting it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk is skewering Donald Trump, and Trump is kind of stunned into submission. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  Trump's not even really addressing it, or he's sheepishly posting other things and saying, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=10.92s)]
*  Elon Musk and Doge support Donald Trump, but Trump doesn't know what to do. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  You have Elon Musk posting over and over again things like this, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=21.72s)]
*  A new spending bill should be drafted that doesn't massively grow the deficit and increase the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=25.76s)]
*  Redraw it! [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=34.88s)]
*  Elon Musk posts, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=36.08s)]
*  Kill Bill with a photo of the movie Kill Bill. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=37.64s)]
*  He then reposts his AI company Grok analyzing the bill and analyzing the claim by Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vogt. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=41.64s)]
*  And Grok says the following, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=53.2s)]
*  The claim that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act reduces deficits by $1.4 trillion over 10 years is not supported by most analysis. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=55.28s)]
*  The CBO estimates it increases the deficits by $2.3 to $3.8 trillion, with CRFB and others projecting $2.6 to $3.1 trillion increase in the deficit, including interest. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  The $1.7 trillion in savings lacks clear evidence from CBO. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  Different baseline and growth assumptions cause discrepancies, but evidence leads toward deficit increases. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=89.76s)]
*  You have Elon Musk also posting the comment section from Fox and showing that people are pissed at Donald Trump and supporting Elon Musk. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk reposts this account Stephanie Tyler that goes, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=109.76s)]
*  Fox News comments is a great place to understand conservative views since they get so much traffic. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=114.56s)]
*  I was curious what the people were saying about Elon shit talking the big beautiful bill. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=120.96s)]
*  I call it the disaster bill. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  And I'm shocked. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=128.28s)]
*  Almost every comment is in agreement with Elon. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=129.4s)]
*  To see so many vehemently disagreeing with Trump is wild. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=132.92s)]
*  GOP better be real careful. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=137.88000000000002s)]
*  And then Elon Musk reposts that with the American flag. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=141.44s)]
*  And you take a look at the comment section that Elon Musk is reposting. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=145.12s)]
*  There are messages like this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  Musk is right. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=151.56s)]
*  I didn't want Trump to cut spending in some areas only to increase it in others. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  I want spending cuts to eliminate the deficit and then start paying down the debt. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=157.84s)]
*  They say when you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=162.72000000000003s)]
*  I agree with Musk on this one. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=167.48s)]
*  I like Trump as much as any conservative, but he is a crazy spender. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=169.24s)]
*  But that's how you get elected regardless he needs cuts. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=173.48s)]
*  He needs to cut spending somewhere. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  I would start with the ditching of the golden dome and anything that has to do with financing trips to Mars or Mars research. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=178.28s)]
*  Another post. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=186.16s)]
*  Musk is right on the money. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=186.88s)]
*  The debt must be reduced. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=188.68s)]
*  Trump has done some great things, but this bill isn't one of them. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=190.24s)]
*  Let me be very clear. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=193.48s)]
*  I think Trump has done zero great things unless he's done great things for other countries who are now rising in power as compared to the United States. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=194.24s)]
*  But Elon Musk continued to make post after post after post. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  And again, no comebacks by Donald Trump, no attack of Elon. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=206.88s)]
*  Elon Musk posts again. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  He's like beaten Donald Trump when he's down. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=216.52s)]
*  Elon Musk goes, call your senator, call your congressman. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  Bankrupting America is not OK. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=221.8s)]
*  Kill the bill. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  And then you had all of these Republican senators responding to Elon Musk. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  And again, Trump goes mute. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=231.44s)]
*  Trump goes silent while all of this is taking place. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  Like he's basically been in hiding since Friday when he lied to the steelworkers at US Steel in Pittsburgh that there wasn't going to be an acquisition by Nippon Steel. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=236.68s)]
*  But Nippon Steel was investing and he promised everybody $5,000 bonuses. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=247.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah, Donald, where are the $5,000 dose checks you were promising anyway? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=252.0s)]
*  Let's take a look at what the Republican senators were saying. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=257.32s)]
*  Let's play. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=259.44s)]
*  I don't do his opinion. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=260.12s)]
*  He's frustrated. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=262.44s)]
*  I think he believes in my judgment correctly that we're quickly becoming debt slaves. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=263.48s)]
*  He certainly has the right and ability to to say what he will about it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  I think people listen to what he has to say, as they should. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=276.12s)]
*  He's a really smart guy. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=279.92s)]
*  I don't think it changed any views in the Republican Party in the Senate. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=280.96s)]
*  He looks at it a different way than we have to look at it, because again, we're the ones that have to vote for it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=284.72s)]
*  Like I said, I can't respond to platitudes. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=289.6s)]
*  That's all I saw on a tweet that I had summarized to me. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=291.52s)]
*  Now, Democratic senators getting in on the action as well. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=296.16s)]
*  Here's Democratic Congress members and Democratic senators getting in on the action as well. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=299.8s)]
*  Here's Democratic Congressman Moskowitz saying, so this is what the Republicans are bragging about. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=305.44s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=311.6s)]
*  Here are the wins for congressional Republicans. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=312.84s)]
*  You're ready? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=315.08s)]
*  They're going to do a nine billion dollar rescission bill, OK, which they're going to get rid of Elmo, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=317.04s)]
*  which you think American people were clamoring for. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=323.0s)]
*  OK, and but they're going to add two point four trillion to the debt. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=325.44s)]
*  Nine billion versus two point four trillion. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=330.04s)]
*  And then they want us to cheer for them and give them a trophy like they were a five year old at a soccer game. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=332.08s)]
*  Everyone gets a trophy for their participation. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=336.4s)]
*  OK, by the way, these things I'm bringing up, Republicans themselves, including the chairwoman, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=339.52s)]
*  have expressed their frustration that Congress has not codified anything at all. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  And here's Congress member Moskowitz again saying, all right, now that there's a national divorce of Elon Musk and Donald Trump, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=351.56s)]
*  who gets custody of Big Balls? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=359.24s)]
*  And Big Balls is the guy that Elon Musk put in to destroy a lot of our essential government services. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=361.92s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=367.24s)]
*  And by the way, now that the national divorce is happening with with Elon Musk and I'm a child of divorce. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=369.36s)]
*  OK, I mean, who's going to get Big Balls? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=375.08s)]
*  I'm worried about him in the divorce. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=377.52s)]
*  The children always get caught in the middle. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=379.24s)]
*  Right. And so I just, you know, if he's out there, I just want him to know we're rooting for him. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=382.44s)]
*  If your manhood feels like the Florida panhandle this time of year, great news. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=386.88s)]
*  You can instantly refresh yourself 15 times a day without jumping in the shower. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  Washing with Tushiba Day transforms swamp butt into a dewy cloud. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  I absolutely love my Tushiba Day. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=401.2s)]
*  Installation was surprisingly quick and easy. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=403.35999999999996s)]
*  Now, I had it up and running in no time with no prior plumbing experience. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  It looks modern and sleek, blending in perfectly with my bathroom aesthetic. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  The cleaning experience is a total game changer, way cleaner and more refreshing than using toilet paper. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=414.68s)]
*  Honestly, I didn't realize how much I was missing out until I tried it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=420.4s)]
*  Tushiba Day is the everyday luxury bidet that instantly transforms your bathroom habits and bottom health for life. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=424.52s)]
*  Tushiba Day gives you two in one benefits, reducing irritation and preventing micro tears with soothing water instead of scratching toilet paper or damaging wet wipes. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=431.56s)]
*  It's also easy to use, sit, cleanse and dry using the built-in air dryer. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=442.92s)]
*  That's right. Cleaning yourself after using the bathroom is now hands free. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=448.56s)]
*  People who have made the switch to Tushiba Day use up to 80% less TP. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=453.24s)]
*  No more clogged toilets. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  Every Hello Tushiba Day comes with a 30 day hassle free return and a 12 month warranty. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=460.52000000000004s)]
*  Keep your swampiest body parts fresh and cool. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  For a limited time, our listeners get 10% off their first bidet order when you use code MIDAS at checkout. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=468.16s)]
*  That's 10% off your first bidet order at HelloTushiba.com with promo code MIDAS. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=475.48s)]
*  So then Fox had to try to get some people on to try to defend Donald Trump. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=482.76000000000005s)]
*  They brought on Dr. Oz and Dr. Oz starts attacking Medicaid. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=486.76000000000005s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=492.8s)]
*  Go back in the school. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=493.8s)]
*  We'll do something to show you have agency over your future. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=495.36s)]
*  And if you're willing to do any of those things, we will check the box and you get to keep your free Medicaid. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=498.56s)]
*  But if you're not willing to do those things, we're going to ask you to go on and do something else. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=504.64s)]
*  Like go on the exchanges or get a job and get into regular commercial insurance. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=508.64s)]
*  But we're not going to continue to pay for Medicaid for those audiences. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=513.48s)]
*  And I think that is a very realistic effort. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=516.8000000000001s)]
*  And it's been done in the past. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=519.52s)]
*  So then Marjorie Taylor Greene came out against the budget bill saying that she didn't read it appropriately [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=521.56s)]
*  and that there's a provision that prevents states from regulating AI. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=528.4s)]
*  And it says that it's exclusively the province of the federal government. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=533.8s)]
*  So Marjorie Taylor Greene said she will not support the bill unless that provision is removed about states can't regulate AI in their state. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=537.04s)]
*  She says it's a states rights issue. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=545.0s)]
*  And then she says, but I support the bill. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=546.92s)]
*  So then Democratic Congressmember Garcia is like, what are you talking about? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=548.9599999999999s)]
*  You just said you didn't support your play this clip. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=552.28s)]
*  It's also interesting because Chairwoman Greene, I understand now regrets voting for this bill, as she mentioned yesterday. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=554.68s)]
*  Is that correct, Chairwoman Greene? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=561.8399999999999s)]
*  Are you yielding me time? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=566.4399999999999s)]
*  No, I'm just asking if you are you. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=567.8399999999999s)]
*  I think you say now you regret voting for the bill, is that correct? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  The bill actually destroys what you guys voted for for the past four years. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=572.0799999999999s)]
*  And I'm proud that to have voted for that bill to fund border security, actually, Chairwoman Greene, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=576.44s)]
*  all these illegals you guys led in the country. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=582.6800000000001s)]
*  Actually, Chairman, yesterday you actually said that you regret actually voting for the bill. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=585.2800000000001s)]
*  You posted after Elon's tweet that you didn't know certain provisions were in it and that you would have voted no if you had known. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=589.24s)]
*  And so obviously you didn't do a thorough review of the bill. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=594.6400000000001s)]
*  And I'm not surprised, of course, that Republicans in this Congress are now going back and forth on the bill. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=597.44s)]
*  And here's Democratic Congressmember Garcia again. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=603.9599999999999s)]
*  We do. Now, all our Republican colleagues might also want to ask Elon Musk about this message, which he actually just posted yesterday. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=606.4799999999999s)]
*  Now, I'm going to read this message Elon Musk posted. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=616.56s)]
*  It says, I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=618.64s)]
*  This massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=622.68s)]
*  And I'll emphasize shame on those who voted for it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=629.4399999999999s)]
*  You know you did wrong. You know it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=633.52s)]
*  Now, this was actually just yesterday. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=635.6800000000001s)]
*  He actually posted this, which is pretty rough if you ask me. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=638.36s)]
*  And on top of that, I would have printed it out. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=642.08s)]
*  But just 20 minutes ago, he posted another message that says, call your senator, call your congressman. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=644.64s)]
*  Bankrupting America is not OK. Kill the bill. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=652.2s)]
*  And of course, we know the only people who voted for this bill are actually House Republicans, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=656.84s)]
*  including every Republican in this room. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=662.36s)]
*  All these Republicans here on this committee, they all voted for this bill that now Elon Musk is saying should be killed and is saying is awful. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=665.88s)]
*  I actually agree with Elon Musk on this. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=673.2s)]
*  It takes health care away from 13 million Americans. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=675.4s)]
*  It cuts food for veterans and seniors, all to finance, of course, huge tax breaks for the wealthy. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=678.16s)]
*  So you have Mike Johnson on the defense and he said he spoke to Trump. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=685.36s)]
*  And this is what Trump had to say. Play this clip. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=689.28s)]
*  And then yesterday, 24 hours later, he does a 180 and he comes out and oppose the bill. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=691.44s)]
*  And it surprised me, frankly. And I don't take it personal. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=696.32s)]
*  We don't take it personal. You know, he's policy differences are not personal. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=699.24s)]
*  I think he's flat wrong. I think he's way off on this. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=705.8800000000001s)]
*  And I've told him as much and I've said it publicly and privately. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=709.7600000000001s)]
*  I'm very consistent in that. But am I concerned about the effect of this on the midterms? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=712.44s)]
*  I'm not. Let me tell you why. Because when the big, beautiful bill is done and signed into law, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=716.6400000000001s)]
*  every single American is going to do better. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=720.52s)]
*  This bill is geared for middle and working class Americans. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=722.84s)]
*  And they are going to feel the effects of it. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=726.12s)]
*  And they're going to feel it before the midterm election. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=728.16s)]
*  So I have no concern whatsoever. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=730.24s)]
*  I'm absolutely convinced that we're going to win the midterms and grow the House majority [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=732.0799999999999s)]
*  because we're delivering for the American people and fulfilling our campaign promises. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=735.72s)]
*  And we'll see how that happens. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=738.56s)]
*  We're getting a lot of other data as well, folks, about this budget bill [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=739.6s)]
*  and just how disastrous this Trump regime has been with the economy. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=743.4s)]
*  Like this from the Associated Press. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=747.04s)]
*  We're seeing this as well from Barron's. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=777.24s)]
*  Companies are already passing along most tariff price increases to shoppers. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=779.1999999999999s)]
*  As Carl Quintanilla says, yeah, we know. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=784.3199999999999s)]
*  I think this is an important piece right here. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=787.1999999999999s)]
*  This is from the Wall Street Journal. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=789.28s)]
*  And what have I been telling you? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=791.36s)]
*  I've been saying that this data that's being published by the Trump regime, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=792.64s)]
*  I said, I don't trust it because they fired the data people. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=796.7199999999999s)]
*  Who's giving us this data? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=800.04s)]
*  And if we know anything about Trump, it's that overwhelming, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=801.7199999999999s)]
*  And if we know anything about Trump, it's that over and over again, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=804.8000000000001s)]
*  he covers up the real data. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=807.8000000000001s)]
*  He covers up the truth. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=809.84s)]
*  Wall Street Journal says the following. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=811.52s)]
*  BLS told outside economists this week that a hiring freeze [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=813.72s)]
*  at the agency was forcing the survey to cut back on the number of businesses [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=818.48s)]
*  where it checks the prices. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=822.88s)]
*  Economists are raising questions about the quality of U.S. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=824.36s)]
*  inflation data. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=828.8000000000001s)]
*  The Labor Department says staffing shortages [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=830.24s)]
*  reduce its ability to conduct its massive monthly survey. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=833.24s)]
*  So the monthly surveys that talk about rising inflation, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=837.16s)]
*  I've been saying they're firing the data people. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=841.48s)]
*  So what's the info that we're getting? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=844.52s)]
*  They're not giving us a good sample. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=846.2s)]
*  How do we rely on any of their data anymore when they fired the data people? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=848.16s)]
*  Trump, as of this recording, still stunned into silence. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=852.8s)]
*  We haven't seen him appear anywhere. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=856.2s)]
*  No public appearance. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=858.16s)]
*  We haven't heard his voice in the past. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=859.16s)]
*  What? Since Friday? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=861.4s)]
*  I don't want to complain. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=862.84s)]
*  It's probably a good thing. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=863.76s)]
*  And no response yet as of this recording to Elon Musk, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOnQj3aWbY&t=865.4s)]
