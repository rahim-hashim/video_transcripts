# MAGA Mike COULD BE TOAST as GOP Deal IMPLODES
**MeidasTouch:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M)
*  Mr. Speaker, the President over the media, in the press interview, would not say if he would uphold the Constitution when it comes to duty laws against migrants. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm wondering if the Constitutional expert is concerned. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=9.0s)]
*  I think that's exactly what he said. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=11.0s)]
*  He said, I don't know. He was asked about it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=12.0s)]
*  Is the President expected to be an expert in all of this when it comes to duty laws against migrants? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=14.0s)]
*  I think he'll uphold the Constitution as demonstrated at the opening. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=20.0s)]
*  That's Maga Mike Johnson walking away from reporters. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=23.0s)]
*  Maga Mike Johnson is once again in the hot seat. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=27.0s)]
*  His job is on the line as there is massive infighting in the Maga Republican Party. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=30.0s)]
*  In that clip I just showed at the outset of this video, Maga Mike Johnson was asked why Donald Trump say that he doesn't know if he needs to follow the Constitution, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=36.0s)]
*  to which Maga Mike said, you can't expect Donald Trump to know about all of those Supreme Court cases. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=45.0s)]
*  I do expect the President of the United States to know about Supreme Court cases, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=51.0s)]
*  but more fundamentally, Maga Mike Johnson, I expect Donald Trump to know about the United States Constitution [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=56.0s)]
*  and a very basic concept we have here in the United States called due process. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=63.0s)]
*  But that's not why Maga Mike Johnson is on the hot seat. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=68.0s)]
*  It's because he's trying to push through what Donald Trump is calling one big beautiful bill [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=71.0s)]
*  through a reconciliation process between the House of Representatives and the Senate. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=78.0s)]
*  And as we've reported before, under the blueprint that was originally passed by the Maga Republicans, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=84.0s)]
*  which calls for, you know, in theory, trillions of dollars in cuts, those cuts are coming from Medicaid. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=91.0s)]
*  Those cuts are coming from education. Those cuts are coming from agriculture. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=99.0s)]
*  Those cuts are coming from infrastructure while the billionaires are getting massive, massive tax cuts. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=105.0s)]
*  You know, the Congressional Budget Office came out with a report today at the request of Democrats [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=113.0s)]
*  and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=119.0s)]
*  Let me repeat, nonpartisan CBO analysis of various Republican plans for Medicaid spending reveals [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=121.0s)]
*  that under every scenario laid out by the GOP, millions would lose insurance. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=128.0s)]
*  The GOP's plans would have a disproportionate impact on low income and elderly populations. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=134.0s)]
*  Literally millions of people would lose their health care because there's going to be $800 billion dollars [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=140.0s)]
*  plus in cuts to Medicaid. How do we know it? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=146.0s)]
*  Because we can read their one big beautiful bill and see it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=149.0s)]
*  But you see what's happening right now, folks, is that the Maga Republicans are fighting each other [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=152.0s)]
*  because they are seeing, whoa, whoa, whoa, it's almost 2026. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=159.0s)]
*  The midterms are getting closer. Could you believe that, folks? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=163.0s)]
*  Yes, hang in there. It's the midterms. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=166.0s)]
*  Before you know it, they're going to be right around the corner. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=168.0s)]
*  And these Maga Republican Congress members are seeing Republicans get beat in seats during special elections. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=170.0s)]
*  They're seeing Supreme Court races in states where Democrats have won big. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=178.0s)]
*  And they're saying, uh-oh, are we next? And the answer is yes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=182.0s)]
*  So they're saying you can't cut Medicaid, you know, Maga Mike, because if you cut Medicaid, we're definitely going to lose. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=187.0s)]
*  Our best shot of staying in power is if you don't cut Medicaid. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=192.0s)]
*  Let's take a look right here at this article from CNN. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=196.0s)]
*  House GOP inviting turns ugly over Trump's big beautiful bill. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=199.0s)]
*  That's what he's calling it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=204.0s)]
*  And he's making all the Maga Republicans refer to it as the big beautiful bill because they're fascist toddlers. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=206.0s)]
*  It says Donald Trump's big beautiful bill is running into a wall in the sharply divided House Republican Conference with tensions spiking over [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=213.0s)]
*  Maga Mike Johnson handling of the party's biggest sticking point, overhauling Medicaid. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=220.0s)]
*  As Johnson presses for a House vote before Memorial Day, the battle lines are becoming more pronounced. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=225.0s)]
*  The Republicans in swing districts are saying the sweeping bill can't slash social safety net benefits, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=230.0s)]
*  while GOP hardliners are saying, but by Medicaid, we don't care if people die and get sick and they're demanding trillions of cuts, many that would be in Medicaid. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=237.0s)]
*  Those frustrations emerged in a two hour meeting in Johnson's leadership suite on Tuesday night in which the speaker huddled with a roughly dozen GOP centrist. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=248.0s)]
*  What's a GOP centrist today? But OK, I'll bite. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=258.0s)]
*  A GOP centrist who have refused to back any Medicaid changes that could hurt eligible Americans who rely on the program inside the room. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=261.0s)]
*  Johnson made one more attempt to sell those members on a contentious plan backed by the hard right House Freedom Caucus and others to sharply reduce Medicaid payments to states that expanded the program under [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=269.0s)]
*  Obamacare, according to two people in the room. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=281.0s)]
*  His push drew a rebuke from multiple centrist. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=284.0s)]
*  There's no such thing as a centrist when it comes to Republicans, but OK, centrist in the room who believe that idea was already off the table that people said, quote, we laid down the law. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=287.0s)]
*  One Republican member who attended the meeting said of the firm position many members took that they don't want to shift the federal match, which was like 90 10 right now, and move it all to the state, which basically means based on certain trigger laws that states have, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=296.0s)]
*  Medicaid would go away in most states under that plan. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=311.0s)]
*  Zero Medicaid, it would eliminate Medicaid for people. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=314.0s)]
*  So if you're in Medicaid, that plan shifting it to the states is bye bye to your Medicaid. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=317.0s)]
*  Johnson and his leadership team insist in the end the GOP members are going to all work together and they're going to make it all work. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=321.0s)]
*  On the one hand, you have Andrew Garbarino from a vulnerable seat in New York, Magna Republican. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=328.0s)]
*  He goes, I don't want to be mean. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=334.0s)]
*  And I think any time it looks like we're actually hurting people, that's going to piss off the American population. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=336.0s)]
*  And if you piss them off, they're probably not going to vote for you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=342.0s)]
*  Notice that he says looks because if it didn't look that way, they'll be happy to be cruel and mean. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=345.0s)]
*  They just don't know how to hide what they're doing right there. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=352.0s)]
*  And then you have all these mega Republicans like Chip Roy and others basically saying bye bye to your Medicaid. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=356.0s)]
*  It needs to be cut. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=362.0s)]
*  Let's take a look at mega Republicans. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=364.0s)]
*  Speaker of the House, Magna Mike Johnson over here. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=366.0s)]
*  Here, you know, he's talking about the big, beautiful bill and he's saying this big, beautiful bill, you know, those little girls got to say bye bye to their dolls. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=368.0s)]
*  Why? Because Donald Trump said that little girl shouldn't have dolls or pencils. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=378.0s)]
*  They get one doll and they get five pencils because Donald Trump's regime does central planning and they say that's what little girls deserve. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=382.0s)]
*  Donald Trump and his family get to what they make two point six billion dollars more in their crypto schemes and their resort deals with Qatar and Oman and Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi buying their cruising their crypto coins. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=391.0s)]
*  But your daughter or granddaughter, how dare she have more than one doll. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=407.0s)]
*  She gets one doll, five pencils, and she's going to pay more for it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=412.0s)]
*  You understand? That's what they're saying. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=416.0s)]
*  And here, Magna Mike Johnson says we got to do it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=418.0s)]
*  We got to do that to the little girls. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=421.0s)]
*  We got to be the disruptors. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=423.0s)]
*  We got to disrupt the system and it's going to cause you pain. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=424.0s)]
*  But you voted for pain, right? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=427.0s)]
*  Trump equals pain. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=429.0s)]
*  That's what you voted for. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=430.0s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=431.0s)]
*  The president said over the weekend that as a result of his terror policy, some kids may have fewer dolls, two and three, 20 or 30, fewer pencils, prices could go up. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=432.0s)]
*  Is that the message that you want to send to the American public? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=444.0s)]
*  I didn't see the interview, but I'll just say that what I think what the president is trying to communicate is, as he mentioned with the terror policy and with all the things that are happening, we had to disrupt the system and we're going to have the desired results. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=447.0s)]
*  I mean, as you know, by some measures, more than 100 countries now renegotiating trade agreements, which would be much more fair for the American people. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=460.0s)]
*  And that is exactly what we were hoping and trying to achieve. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=467.0s)]
*  What the president was trying to achieve with that terror policy is more free and fair trade relations. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=470.0s)]
*  And I think that will be the result. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=475.0s)]
*  So whatever short term disruption there is or discomfort, I think what he's trying to say there, I think, is that it will well pay off in the long run. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=477.0s)]
*  And I think that will happen sooner than many people anticipate. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=486.0s)]
*  So we're waiting to see and we'll hold the line. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=489.0s)]
*  But reconciliation is on track. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=491.0s)]
*  And if anybody tells you otherwise, they're not in the room with us. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=493.0s)]
*  Thanks. Yeah. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=496.0s)]
*  So that's the campaign they're running. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=497.0s)]
*  The Trump causes you pain campaign. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=499.0s)]
*  Okay. No pun intended. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=502.0s)]
*  Here's Maga Republican Chip Roy talking about gutting Medicaid. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=504.0s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=507.0s)]
*  Look, we have an obligation to do what we said we would do. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=508.0s)]
*  The president said we should get our deficits under control and balance the budget. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=511.0s)]
*  He recognizes that Medicaid needs to be reformed. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=515.0s)]
*  He said so. His office has put it out. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=518.0s)]
*  We should deliver. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=520.0s)]
*  We should deliver responsibly so we can deliver on the tax cuts. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=522.0s)]
*  The growth that we need, but also the health care reform so that we're not leaving the vulnerable on the outside looking in. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=525.0s)]
*  And we're delivering deficit reduction for the American people rather than propping up a failed program. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=530.0s)]
*  Republicans need to find the willingness to fight. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=535.0s)]
*  Here is Maga Republican Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=537.0s)]
*  Here's he's asked by Fox. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=541.0s)]
*  So are we going to get a tax bill before Memorial Day as Maga Mike Johnson promises? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=543.0s)]
*  And Ron Johnson from Wisconsin says, nope, because of the stupid big, beautiful bill thing. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=548.0s)]
*  We could have got it done if we didn't do big, beautiful bill. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=554.0s)]
*  But now we have stupid, big, beautiful bill here. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=557.0s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=559.0s)]
*  But the tax bill, will we get it before Memorial Day? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=560.0s)]
*  No, no, there's no way because, again, unfortunately, President Trump chose the one big, beautiful bill. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=565.0s)]
*  What he should have done is the multiple step process. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=571.0s)]
*  I suggest that three steps get the border funding. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=574.0s)]
*  Second step, just extend current tax law. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=576.0s)]
*  So we take an automatic tax increase off the table. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=579.0s)]
*  But how do we get it before the end of the year quickly? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=581.0s)]
*  Not if we don't come down with a reasonable pre pandemic level spending. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=584.0s)]
*  There's enough of us in the Senate that will not agree to that. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=587.0s)]
*  Oh, boy, that's bad news. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=589.0s)]
*  Senator, thank you for that. Appreciate it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=591.0s)]
*  Have a good weekend. Appreciate you coming on. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=593.0s)]
*  Did you know that the liver is the second largest organ in your body? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=595.0s)]
*  It's responsible for over 500 functions in your body. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=598.0s)]
*  But for some reason, liver health doesn't always get the attention that it deserves. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=601.0s)]
*  Dose for your liver was formulated to cleanse your liver of unwanted elements, aid digestion, and maintain your body's filter. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=605.0s)]
*  Why does this matter? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=612.0s)]
*  Well, your liver is the second largest organ in your body and is responsible for over 500 functions in your body. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=613.0s)]
*  It acts as your body's filter, flushing out unwanted elements and breaking down what you consume into essential nutrients. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=620.0s)]
*  The liver produces and regulates cholesterol, stores vitamins and minerals, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=627.0s)]
*  and impacts digestive and metabolic health, amongst many other things. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=631.0s)]
*  Dose's science-backed formula promotes liver function, aids digestion, eases bloating, and even boosts energy levels. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=635.0s)]
*  Clinical results. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=642.0s)]
*  In a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, dose for your liver lowered liver enzyme levels by 50% in over 86% of participants. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=643.0s)]
*  Stick with dose and feel the incredible benefits. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=653.0s)]
*  Over time, with more energy, better digestion, reduced bloating, healthier liver enzyme function, reduction of brain fog, and better sleep, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=656.0s)]
*  one dose for your liver shot is equivalent to 17 shots of turmeric juice. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=664.0s)]
*  Dose is gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, and vegan. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=669.0s)]
*  Save 30% on your first month of subscription by going to dosedaily.co.uk or entering MITIS at checkout. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=672.0s)]

*  Now, a MAGA Republican who pretends he's not MAGA Republican, Mike Lawler from New York. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=690.0s)]
*  Here he's asked on Fox Business, are you good with the MAGA plan that they're talking about to shift Medicaid to the states? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=697.0s)]
*  And MAGA Republican Mike Lawler, who pretends not to be MAGA, goes, hell no, hell no. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=705.0s)]
*  He's trying to pretend that he's not that MAGA, but he's very MAGA. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=711.0s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=716.0s)]
*  Austin Scott was with me yesterday. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=717.0s)]
*  He mentioned about changes to Medicaid and how that could be a part of budget negotiations, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=718.0s)]
*  basically pulling away federal funding from Medicaid programs, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=723.0s)]
*  meaning that a state like New York would have to pay more for Medicaid and that the federal government would pay less. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=726.0s)]
*  Do you have a position on that before you go? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=732.0s)]
*  Hell no. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=735.0s)]
*  New York is a donor state. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=736.0s)]
*  We pay more into the federal government than we get back. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=739.0s)]
*  I'm adamantly opposed to changing the FMAP floor from 50% federal share to 45% federal share. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=742.0s)]
*  That will be a hard no. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=749.0s)]
*  Here's MAGA Republican GOP conference chair Lisa McLean from Michigan. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=751.0s)]
*  Here she's like, yeah, it's getting messy, but that's DC for you. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=756.0s)]
*  We're getting messy. We're getting messy. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=760.0s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=762.0s)]
*  It's going to get messy, right? It's not going to be perfect, as you're seeing. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=763.0s)]
*  And everybody's doing what they need to do, which is represent their district, right? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=766.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we'll all come together and we'll end up passing one big beautiful bill. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=771.0s)]
*  Our market's going to happen next week. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=776.0s)]
*  They're still scheduled. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=778.0s)]
*  So I think we're making progress, right? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=780.0s)]
*  And don't let the disagreement and the debate get us too far off track, right? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=783.0s)]
*  There's going to be disagreement. There's going to be debate. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=792.0s)]
*  But right now, the markups are still scheduled. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=797.0s)]
*  I think they're still going to happen, but anything can change. It's DC. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=801.0s)]
*  Is the timeline slipping? Is the timeline slipping from Memorial Day? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=805.0s)]
*  The timeline is not slipping. If we have the markups next week, I mean, it's a tight timeline, no question. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=809.0s)]
*  So as long as the markups happen next week, we can still do the 31st Memorial Day of Deadline. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=814.0s)]
*  But we just got to get to work and keep working and keep talking and talking is progress, in my opinion. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=822.0s)]
*  You're getting messy. Look, y'all haven't passed a budget now. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=828.0s)]
*  And what has it been? Four years since you've passed it? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=832.0s)]
*  And you didn't pass the budget. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=836.0s)]
*  You've been doing continuing resolution CRs from Nancy Pelosi's like budget from 2021 or 2022. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=838.0s)]
*  Y'all haven't been able to pass a budget, your most basic task. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=849.0s)]
*  So here you are trying to do it. You're calling it one big, beautiful bill. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=853.0s)]
*  And while you're doing it, you're crushing the economy. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=857.0s)]
*  You're causing a lot of pain and suffering. But Trump don't care. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=859.0s)]
*  Trump selling meme coins where only 57 wallets, 57 like people who bought Trump meme coins made money. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=862.0s)]
*  Seven hundred and forty seven thousand lost money. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=869.0s)]
*  What do you know? Another Trump scam. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=872.0s)]
*  Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, announced yesterday if tariffs are not reduced, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=874.0s)]
*  we should expect higher inflation and lower employment. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=879.0s)]
*  And he did not lower interest rates as a result. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=883.0s)]
*  What else are we learning? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=887.0s)]
*  The U.S. is pushing nations facing tariffs to approve Elon Musk's Starlink, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=888.0s)]
*  as what the intelligence cables are showing. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=893.0s)]
*  Some countries are being told if you don't get Elon's Starlink, you're going to get hurt economically. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=897.0s)]
*  So I guess that's what it's all about. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=902.0s)]
*  According to Goldman Sachs, inflation is about to imminent. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=904.0s)]
*  Goldman Sachs has had conservative financial models erring on the side of bullish over bearish. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=908.0s)]
*  And now Goldman's getting very bearish. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=915.0s)]
*  According to Goldman Sachs, inflation is about to imminently take off and not stop accelerating until June 2026. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=917.0s)]
*  Lots more inflation. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=925.0s)]
*  So that's what you've got, Maga Mike. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=927.0s)]
*  One big beautiful mess that you all created for we the people. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=929.0s)]
*  So we'll check back in, Maga Mike, if you lose your job. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0lZdtpH7M&t=934.0s)]
