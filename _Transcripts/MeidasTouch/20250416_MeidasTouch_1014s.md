*  She wouldn't really even have people ask questions. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=22.8s)]
*  She was reading the questions live and you got questions like that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=24.78s)]
*  You also got Marjorie Taylor Greene get questions like this about Donald Trump being not physically [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=29.14s)]
*  or mentally well. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=35.2s)]
*  Watch how she handled it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=37.16s)]

*  What are you doing to protect us in the 14th district from the damage and extreme hardship [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=39.16s)]
*  of Trump's tariffs? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=45.7s)]
*  Guttin' of Social Security and Medicaid. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=49.06s)]
*  Doge gutting our government with a chainsaw approach in the utter destruction and ignoring [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=54.54s)]
*  of our Constitution and rule of law. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=60.6s)]
*  He is not well physically or mentally and he's making nonsensical orders based on his [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  whim of the day. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=69.92s)]
*  How are you going to rein him in to protect us? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=71.88s)]
*  Oh, poor Christina. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=76.12s)]
*  Poor, poor Christina. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=78.56s)]
*  Well, I'm sure Christina, you think that you're pretty smart. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=81.54s)]
*  But the reality is you are being completely brainwashed by whatever source of news you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=84.94s)]
*  listen to. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=90.34s)]
*  The facts are this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=91.58s)]

*  Yes. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=100.06s)]
*  Fraudsters have lost it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=101.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=102.86s)]
*  And illegal aliens have lost it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=103.86s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=106.54s)]
*  If you want to defend those people where you hate our country and you hate America, what [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=107.56s)]
*  am I going to do? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=112.92s)]
*  I am going to stand by my president. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=113.92s)]
*  I am going to support my president. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=116.76s)]
*  And I am going to fight for his agenda with everything I have in Congress. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  And that's what I'm going to do for the 14th district because I know for a fact you are [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=124.04s)]
*  going to have more money in your pocket. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  You're going to have more jobs available. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=130.96s)]
*  You're going to have a stronger economy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=133.04s)]
*  And you're going to have safe cities and communities to live in. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=135.06s)]
*  And you'll be safe from terrorists, cartels, and criminals. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=138.45999999999998s)]
*  And God bless President Trump for that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=142.73999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to show you more of Marjorie Taylor Greene's town hall from yesterday. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=146.38s)]
*  I also want to show you Maggert Republican Congress member Brian Mast from Jupiter, Florida. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=150.26s)]
*  Now, he got mercilessly booed over and over again. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=156.7s)]
*  Let me show you one such incident of that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=161.01999999999998s)]
*  Let's play this clip right now. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=162.94s)]
*  ... by U.S. Perry going to the end. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=164.68s)]
*  So these are all very specific examples. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=167.68s)]
*  That's not a Godlike thing to say in the church. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=172.68s)]
*  And what we're going to get to is free trade for the United States. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=177.68s)]
*  Yeah, it was pretty much him getting booed the entire time right there. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=184.2s)]
*  Let's go back to the Marjorie Taylor Greene clip I showed you at the beginning so you [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=188.52s)]
*  get the full context of the question and ultimately how she answered here. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=192.56s)]
*  Let's play the clip. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=196.78s)]
*  Why are you such a coward in the face of an obvious fascist takeover, Andrew? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=201.38s)]
*  Scary. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=208.54s)]
*  That's scary. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=209.54s)]
*  You know, I've yet to see a fascist gathering. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=210.54s)]
*  That doesn't exist in the Republican Party. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=219.22s)]
*  As a matter of fact, President Trump is the most transparent president in history. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=221.86s)]
*  The man literally talks to the press every single day. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=226.46s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  Not only that, he takes them on Air Force One and takes them to UFC fights. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=231.46s)]
*  He talks to them and gaggles on the plane. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=236.26000000000002s)]
*  He talks to them all the time. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=238.66000000000003s)]
*  This is such an amazing thing that happened. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=242.78000000000003s)]
*  You know, well, the Associated Press shouldn't have told as many lies as they did about President [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=245.62s)]
*  Trump. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=249.70000000000002s)]
*  Okay, then a protester was there who referred to Marjorie Taylor Greene as you are a butch [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=251.17999999999998s)]
*  body bigot. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=256.46s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=257.46s)]
*  That are not just living at the border. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=259.46s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, they're all inside the interior of the United States. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=262.09999999999997s)]
*  All inside the interior of the United States. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=267.98s)]
*  The protest is outside. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=274.82s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=276.46s)]
*  The protest is outside. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=277.46s)]
*  You butch body bigot. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=278.46s)]
*  You butch body bigot. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=279.46s)]
*  Protest is outside. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=280.46s)]
*  Bye. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=281.46s)]
*  Have fun out there. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=282.46s)]
*  Then a protester was there with a sign that said, jail for insider traitors. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=287.73999999999995s)]
*  That obviously struck a nerve with day trader Marjorie Taylor Greene, who made a lot of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=292.85999999999996s)]
*  suspicious trades right before Donald Trump's announcements on tariffs. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=301.79999999999995s)]
*  I am in a place where I am one of the members of Congress that usually has the highest amount [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=302.8s)]
*  of death threats. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=310.32s)]
*  As a matter of fact... [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=312.56s)]
*  Going to Iowa right now, Chuck Grassley got jeered at a town hall meeting when he was [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=316.38s)]
*  asked about Donald Trump refusing to abide by a Supreme Court's ruling. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=323.08000000000004s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=327.6s)]
*  Are you going to bring that guy back from El Salvador? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=328.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=332.6s)]
*  Are you? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=333.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=334.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=335.6s)]
*  Why not? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=336.6s)]
*  Well, because that's not a power of Congress. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=337.6s)]
*  The Supreme Court said to bring him back. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=342.6s)]
*  The President is in a holding of the Constitution. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=344.6s)]
*  You're on the judiciary committee. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=348.6s)]
*  Trump don't care. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=351.6s)]
*  If I get an order, pay a ticket for $1,200 and I just say no, does that stand up? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=354.6s)]
*  Because he's got an order from the Supreme Court and he's just said no! [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=360.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=364.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=365.6s)]
*  Screw it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=366.6s)]
*  I'll be able to answer your question. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=367.6s)]
*  You ignored my letter. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=369.6s)]
*  A lot of dollars. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=371.6s)]
*  May I do? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=373.6s)]
*  El Salvador is an independent country. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=374.6s)]
*  Can you speak up, please? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=377.6s)]
*  We can't hear you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=379.6s)]
*  The President of that country is not subject to our U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=380.6s)]
*  Trump won't be bringing back. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=385.6s)]
*  Trump won't be bringing back. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=387.6s)]
*  I'm pissed. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=389.6s)]
*  If we're paying him to keep him down here, we don't have to pay him. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=392.6s)]
*  The older I get, the more I find myself wanting to be more intentional about the way I live, eat, and take care of my body. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=396.6s)]
*  That's why I'm so happy I found MOSH. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=402.6s)]
*  MOSH, which you may have heard about on Shark Tank, was founded by Maria Shriver and her son Patrick Schwarzenegger with a simple mission to create a conversation about brain health through food, education, and research. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=405.6s)]
*  Maria's father suffered from Alzheimer's, and since then, she and Patrick have dedicated themselves to finding ways to help other families dealing with this debilitating disease. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=416.6s)]
*  MOSH joined forces with the world's top scientists and functional nutritionists to go beyond your average protein bar. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=425.6s)]
*  With eight delicious flavors, including a plant-based one in peanut butter and chocolate, each MOSH bar is made with ingredients that support brain health like ashwagandha, lion's mate, collagen, and omega-3s. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=431.6s)]
*  And now MOSH bars come with a new look and new formulation, featuring a game-changing brain-boosting ingredient that you won't find in any other bar. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=442.6s)]

*  Why gender-based? Because two-thirds of all Alzheimer's patients are women. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=468.6s)]
*  MOSH is working closely to close the gap between women and men's health research. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=472.6s)]
*  Personally, I love the taste of my MOSH bars. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=476.6s)]

*  More from that town hall right here. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=510.6s)]
*  You have MAGA Republican Senator Chuck Grassley seeing very angry Iowa residents who were letting them know about, you know, so Donald Trump is, I'm trying to get this straight. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=513.6s)]
*  So Donald Trump is doing tax cuts for billionaires, $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=525.6s)]
*  But y'all are saying that $70 is too much for food stamps for people who are starving to death. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=531.6s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=536.6s)]
*  I think the general population is sick and tired of hearing about the tax cuts for the wealthy, the ultra wealthy, the uber rich, whatever you want to call them. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=537.6s)]
*  When you start nitpicking about whether some single mom or single dad or somebody with somebody in prison is getting $70 too much food stamps, it doesn't even buy you anything at the grocery store. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=547.6s)]
*  More on Senator Chuck Grassley's town hall here. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=560.6s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=563.6s)]
*  There's money going to go out to the people that are doing Medicare Advantage. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=564.6s)]
*  That is privatization of Medicare. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=569.6s)]
*  And we don't want it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=571.6s)]
*  And they take advantage of people all the time. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=573.6s)]
*  But 50 percent of the seniors do want it because of... [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=576.6s)]
*  No, they don't want it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=579.6s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=581.6s)]
*  Let me explain why I said 50 percent of the seniors don't want it. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=583.6s)]
*  Let me explain why I said 50 percent. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=587.6s)]
*  50 percent of the seniors are enrolled in Medicare Advantage. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=590.6s)]
*  Because... [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=595.6s)]
*  No, that doesn't mean they want it. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=596.6s)]
*  They've got a choice. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=598.6s)]
*  It's insurance companies that are controlling you. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=601.6s)]
*  And they'll tell you that you must call in every year because they can change the rules, whatever they want to do. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=607.6s)]
*  And then there was a moment as well in Marjorie Taylor Greene's town hall [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=613.6s)]
*  where an individual who was there protesting her or disagreeing with her was actually tased by the police. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=617.6s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=625.6s)]
*  Stop. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=643.6s)]
*  This is a peaceful town hall. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=644.6s)]
*  Now, this is a peaceful town hall. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=648.6s)]
*  And then Marjorie Taylor Greene lied and said that tariffs are not a massive tax on the American people. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=650.6s)]
*  Let's play this. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=655.6s)]
*  The reality is tariffs are not a massive tax on the American people. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=656.6s)]
*  The tax on the American people that you've been suffering with is the inflation that Biden and the Democrats put on the American people [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=662.6s)]
*  from their absolute reckless spending for the past four years. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=670.6s)]
*  I want you to see the contrast between Marjorie Taylor Greene town hall. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=674.6s)]
*  What are Democrats doing? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=679.6s)]
*  Fight the oligarchy tour. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=681.6s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, AOC. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=683.6s)]
*  Yesterday, they were in Bakersfield, which voted for Trump like 60% of the people voted for. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=685.6s)]
*  Trump beat Kamala Harris in Bakersfield, which is part of Kern County by like 30 points. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=692.6s)]
*  Even Senator Adam Schiff didn't win Kern County. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=699.6s)]
*  I think he lost to the Republican candidate by like 30 points as well. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=702.6s)]
*  Ruby Red area. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=706.6s)]
*  But they have a MAGA Republican Congress member, Valadeo, who's refusing to show up and do town halls. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=708.6s)]
*  He's scared and vulnerable. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=714.6s)]
*  And Bernie Sanders and AOC, after going to Idaho, Salt Lake City, they were in Nampa, Idaho, Salt Lake City, Utah, Los Angeles. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=716.6s)]
*  They've been traveling the country and then I've been following Bernie's tour when he was in Michigan and Wisconsin. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=725.6s)]
*  But here he is in Bakersfield, California, which is a Ruby Red area in California. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=731.6s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=735.6s)]
*  Now you have a congressman here. His name is Representative Valadeo. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=736.6s)]
*  So I don't know if he's watching the live stream or not. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=743.6s)]
*  But if he is, let me just say this to him. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=749.6s)]
*  I come from the state of Vermont and I'm here in Bakersfield. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=752.6s)]
*  Alexandria comes from New York and she is here in Bakersfield. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=762.6s)]
*  Now, Mr. Congressman, you live in this district. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=771.6s)]
*  Why don't you show up at a town meeting like this? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=776.6s)]
*  And here is AOC not holding back. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=782.6s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=794.6s)]
*  Bakersfield. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=795.6s)]
*  This is a matter of fact. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=796.6s)]
*  Donald Trump is a criminal. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=799.6s)]
*  He was found. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=802.6s)]
*  He was found guilty of 34 felony counts of fraud. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=803.6s)]
*  He was found liable for sexual abuse. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=809.6s)]
*  And if he wants to find the rapists and criminals in this country, he should look in the mirror. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=815.6s)]
*  Share this with you as well, our friend, Democratic Congress member, Ro Khanna. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=826.6s)]
*  Here he was speaking to students and he was saying how J.D. Vance is a stain on the degree of every Yale Law student. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=831.6s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=841.6s)]
*  In Vance's America, police can knock on any immigrant's door, deport him to a dictatorship without due process, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=842.6s)]
*  and then wash their hands off his fate, pretending that America is powerless to free someone outside our borders. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=853.6s)]
*  That's what they did with Abrego. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=864.6s)]
*  That's what they've done with Merlo Bucheres, a 19-year-old Venezuelan who may have no criminal record and whose heartbroken father is searching for him in vain. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=867.6s)]
*  Let me say this as clearly as I can. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=880.6s)]
*  J.D. Vance, your cold indifference to the lives of vulnerable immigrants betrays every principle that this law school was built upon. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=883.6s)]
*  Finally, former President Biden spoke yesterday in Chicago, gave a great speech. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=896.6s)]
*  And here's a small clip of what he had to say. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=901.6s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=903.6s)]
*  So this is desperately need you. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=904.6s)]
*  Folks, it's not just the Secretary of Commerce. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=908.6s)]
*  We heard how others, empowered and emboldened by this administration, talk about Social Security. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=911.6s)]
*  One of them called a Ponzi scheme. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=919.6s)]
*  A Ponzi scheme? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=922.6s)]
*  What the hell are they talking about? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=925.6s)]
*  People earn these benefits. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=927.6s)]
*  They paid into that benefit. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=929.6s)]
*  They rely on that benefit. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=932.6s)]
*  And no one, no one, no one should take it away. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=934.6s)]
*  Oh, this was a great moment, too. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=940.6s)]
*  So Michael Cohen, Jim Acosta, Don Lemon held a town hall in New York and they gave the Midas Touch Network a shout out. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=942.6s)]
*  That was a pretty cool moment from the town hall by Lemon Acosta and Cohen on New Media. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=949.6s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=953.6s)]
*  It's going to make a difference in getting the world. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=954.6s)]
*  You want to know how we get it done? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=956.6s)]
*  Take Midas Touch Network. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=958.6s)]
*  The Midas Touch Network started out with one person and now they're up to five million people that's on there. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=959.6s)]
*  That every single day they're putting out additional content. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=964.6s)]
*  You take their five million, you add Jim's and you add Don's and you add Olivia's and Tara's and Harry's and my few. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=967.6s)]
*  And you put it together. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=975.6s)]
*  And next thing you know, they're beating Joe Rogan. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=976.6s)]
*  They're beating out Fox. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=980.6s)]
*  They're beating out mainstream, mainstream news. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=981.6s)]
*  All right. So when they now have some sort of a march or anything, all you need to do is you contact the Mycelis brothers. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=985.6s)]
*  Next thing you know, you got 10 million people showing up. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=992.6s)]
*  And that, that's an army. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=995.6s)]
*  One more thing. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=997.6s)]
*  There you have it, folks. Let me know what you think. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpX5Ap1gZA&t=998.6s)]
