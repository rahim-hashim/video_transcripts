# VERY FATIGUED Trump LOSES HIS MIND in Worst Interview
**MeidasTouch:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q)
*  Wait a minute. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=2.0s)]
*  Yeah, there was lots of huffing and puffing in this interview. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=3.0s)]
*  Terry Moran from ABC actually delivered an incredible pitch perfect interview of Donald [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=7.08s)]
*  Trump and Trump was fumbling and bubbling and just looked like an absolute idiot. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=12.92s)]
*  This was a 100 day Trump interview and the ABC reporter, I mean, stepped up. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=18.16s)]
*  I want you to watch what went down. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=24.64s)]
*  Donald Trump claimed that Braygo Garcia had MS-13 tattooed on his knuckles with the actual [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=25.96s)]
*  letter M, number one, three letter S and it was clearly photoshopped. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=33.64s)]
*  You can literally look at it and Donald Trump's like, no, it says MS-13. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=39.24s)]
*  Just watch this play. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=43.0s)]
*  He wasn't a member of a gang and then they looked and on his knuckles he had MS-13. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=44.96s)]
*  There's a dispute over that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  He had some tattoos that are interpreted that way, but let's move on. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=54.279999999999994s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  Hey, Terry, Terry, Terry. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  He did not have the letter MS-13. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  It says MS-13. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=63.64s)]
*  That was photoshopped. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=65.44s)]
*  That was photoshopped. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=66.44s)]
*  Terry, you can't do that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=67.44s)]
*  Hey, they're giving you the big break of a lifetime. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=69.44s)]
*  You know, you're doing the interview. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=72.0s)]
*  I picked you because frankly, I never heard of you, but that's okay. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=73.0s)]
*  I picked you, Terry, but you're not being very nice. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=76.24s)]
*  He had MS-13 tattooed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=80.08s)]
*  We'll agree to disagree. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=81.08s)]
*  I want to move on to something else. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=82.08s)]
*  Do you want me to show you the picture? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  I saw the picture. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=86.64s)]
*  We'll agree to disagree. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=87.64s)]
*  And you think it was photoshopped? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=88.64s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=89.64s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=90.64s)]
*  Don't photoshop it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=91.64s)]
*  Don't look at his hand. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=92.64s)]
*  He had MS-13. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=93.64s)]
*  He did have tattoos that can be interpreted that way. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=94.64s)]
*  I'm not an expert on them. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=95.64s)]
*  I want to turn to Ukraine. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=96.64s)]
*  No, no. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=97.64s)]
*  Terry, Terry. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=98.64s)]
*  I want to get to Ukraine. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=99.64s)]
*  No, no. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=100.64s)]
*  He had MS as clear as you can be, not interpreted. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=101.64s)]
*  This is why people no longer believe the news because it's fake news. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  When he was photographed in El Salvador, they aren't there, but let's just go on. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=108.84s)]
*  They aren't there when he's in El Salvador. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=113.04s)]
*  They weren't there, but they're there now, right? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=115.0s)]
*  No, they're in your picture. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=117.0s)]
*  Terry, he's got MS-13 on his knuckles. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=119.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=122.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=123.0s)]
*  We'll take a look. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=124.0s)]
*  It's such a disservice. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=125.0s)]
*  We'll take a look at that, sir. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=126.0s)]
*  Why don't you just say yes, he does, and go on to something else? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=127.0s)]
*  He's contested. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=131.0s)]
*  Next up, Donald Trump lies and claims that tourism is way up and it's going so good when [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=132.8s)]
*  we all know that tourism is crashing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  Again, it's just the most easy thing to prove as a lie, but here Donald Trump saying that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=140.88s)]
*  things are great and it's going to get better. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=146.16s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=148.24s)]
*  Canadians, many of them, are really angry, furious about your talk about we're going [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=149.24s)]
*  to take over Canada, it's going to become the 51st state. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=155.48s)]
*  It kind of is of a piece, a lot of travel is down into the United States from around [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=159.0s)]
*  the world. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=164.16s)]
*  It feels like there's been reputational damage. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=165.16s)]
*  The country's doing great. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=167.16s)]
*  Prices are down. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=169.16s)]
*  Gasoline's down, energy's down. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=170.6s)]
*  Tourism is going to be way up. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=173.72s)]
*  When you see the numbers, the tourism is way up. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=175.24s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=177.64s)]
*  Now Canada, oh, tourism's doing very well. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=178.64s)]
*  We're doing very well. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=181.16s)]
*  We're doing very well. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=182.68s)]
*  When you see the real numbers come out in about, in six months from now, when you see [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=183.68s)]
*  the numbers. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=187.96s)]
*  But do you think, I'm going to ask you if I may, do you think that- [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=188.96s)]
*  You literally have a lot of the world boycotting travel and tourism into the United States. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  Canada's gone elbows up. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=197.88s)]
*  They ain't showing up here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=198.88s)]
*  We know this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  There's actual data reflecting of this. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  Europeans aren't showing up here. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=204.0s)]
*  Australians aren't. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=205.0s)]
*  People from across the world, South America, Central America, Mexico, elsewhere, really [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=206.0s)]
*  are not trying to come here because they don't want to be put in detention centers if they're [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=209.28s)]
*  tourists or sent to concentration camps and get cavity searched and just put in detention [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=214.12s)]
*  centers for weeks on end. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=219.16s)]
*  Donald Trump then talks about the suffering that people are feeling right now is what [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=220.96s)]
*  they signed up for. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=225.88s)]
*  He promised suffering, he says. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=226.88s)]
*  Let's hear, play this clip. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=228.28s)]
*  Concern out there. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=229.28s)]
*  People are worried. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=230.36s)]
*  Even some people who voted for you saying, I didn't sign up for this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=231.36s)]
*  So how do you answer those concerns? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, they did sign up for it actually. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=237.8s)]
*  And this is what I campaigned on. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=240.08s)]
*  I said that we've been abused by other countries at levels that nobody's ever seen before. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=241.96s)]
*  We were losing three to $5 billion a day on trade. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=247.9s)]
*  And Donald Trump then talks about the 145% tariffs on China as a very good thing and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=254.88s)]
*  that he thinks it's great. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=259.52s)]
*  So for everyone who keeps saying, oh, we're moving closer to a deal with China. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=260.62s)]
*  No, we're not. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=265.24s)]
*  You're just manipulating the markets here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=266.24s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=268.2s)]
*  Secretary, we basically have an embargo on China. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=269.2s)]
*  Look, you're trying to say something's going to happen. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=271.2s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=273.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=274.4s)]
*  Well, nothing's going to happen. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=275.4s)]
*  You know business. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=276.4s)]
*  I want to ask you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=277.4s)]
*  I want to ask you. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=278.4s)]
*  I do know business. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=279.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=280.4s)]
*  So 145% tariffs on China. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=281.4s)]
*  And that is basically an embargo. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=282.4s)]
*  They deserve it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  It'll raise prices on everything from electronics to clothing to building houses. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  You don't know that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=288.96s)]
*  You don't know whether or not China's going to eat it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=289.96s)]
*  That's mathematics. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=291.96s)]
*  China probably will eat those tariffs. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=292.96s)]
*  But at 145, they basically can't do much business with the United States. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=294.35999999999996s)]
*  And they were making from us a trillion dollars a year. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  They were ripping us off like nobody's ever ripped us off. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=302.14s)]
*  And by the way, we have other countries that were just as bad. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=305.28s)]
*  If you look at the European Union, it was terrible what they've done to us. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=308.28s)]
*  Every country, almost every country in the world was ripping us off. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=312.08s)]
*  They're not doing that anymore. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=315.35999999999996s)]
*  I want you to think of. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=316.68s)]
*  Next up, you have Donald Trump admitting that he weaponizes the DOJ. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=317.68s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=322.32s)]
*  That Biden knew anything about it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=323.32s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=324.8s)]
*  But you are the president now. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=325.8s)]
*  I'm asking the justification for going after people you don't like. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=327.08s)]
*  No, no. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=331.47999999999996s)]
*  The people that I think are dishonest. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  It's not that I don't even know most of them. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=334.84s)]
*  The people that I think are dishonest. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=337.47999999999996s)]
*  These people make you angry. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  No, it's not anger. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=339.47999999999996s)]
*  These are people that I think are very dishonest. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=340.88s)]
*  I don't think they're worthy of being able to go into top secret information. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=344.24s)]
*  I think that's fine. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  And Biden did that with many of our people. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=350.8s)]
*  But when you look at it, these are people that I don't think are worthy. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=354.24s)]
*  That's my decision. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=358.12s)]
*  It's not a question of anger. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=359.12s)]
*  OK, let's talk about jeans. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=360.12s)]
*  You know, those stiff, uncomfortable leg prisons that cost a fortune, squeeze all the wrong [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=362.16s)]
*  places and make bending over a high stakes operation. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=366.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I used to hate jeans too. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=369.12s)]

*  I mean, who knew jeans could actually be this comfortable? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=386.24s)]
*  I can bend, stretch, run errands, break out dance moves. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=388.92s)]
*  I have no business attempting. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=392.48s)]
*  And yeah, I look damn good doing it as well. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=394.04s)]

*  Play this clip. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=456.70000000000005s)]
*  A couple of weeks ago you said something that struck me. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=457.70000000000005s)]
*  You said concerning the tariffs, which economists say are going to raise prices, you said, quote, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=460.62s)]
*  hang tough. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=467.58000000000004s)]
*  It won't be easy. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=469.18s)]
*  You said that to the American people. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=470.18s)]
*  Is that what Americans should expect? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=471.18s)]
*  Well, I've said that. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=472.18s)]
*  I've said that to my campaign. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=473.18s)]
*  Look, we won a campaign by a lot. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=475.22s)]
*  We won all seven swing states. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=477.62s)]
*  We won the popular vote by a lot. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=479.36s)]
*  We had a tremendous campaign. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=481.74s)]
*  I said all these things during my campaign. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=483.26s)]
*  I said you're going to have a transition period. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=485.78s)]
*  We've been ripped off by every country all over the world. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=488.58s)]
*  They're laughing at us. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=491.38s)]
*  They thought we were stupid people and we were. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=492.38s)]
*  I told you, this is a good interview. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=494.53999999999996s)]
*  He did a great, good job this interview. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=498.18s)]
*  Terry Moran then talks about how, what's your message to small businesses? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=501.82s)]
*  Like, okay, you're giving favors to Apple. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=506.82s)]
*  They can negotiate exemptions to tariffs. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=509.24s)]
*  Like, what's your plan for small businesses? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=511.73999999999995s)]
*  And Trump's like, it doesn't matter. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=514.62s)]
*  Apple's doing great. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=517.02s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=518.02s)]
*  So your message to those small businesses who are saying we can't live a month, two [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=519.02s)]
*  months with these tariffs, Apple got a big deal. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=523.18s)]
*  Is there something for them? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=526.8199999999999s)]
*  No, no, not only Apple. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=527.8199999999999s)]
*  We've got seven to eight trillion dollars being invested in our country in two months. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=529.34s)]
*  Biden didn't have that over a year. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=534.14s)]
*  I mean, if you look at Biden, nobody was really investing in this country. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=535.62s)]
*  The country was ripping off our country. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=540.66s)]
*  Apple's putting up five hundred billion dollars, but that's only one of many companies. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=542.42s)]
*  Companies are flooding into our country right now. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=546.98s)]
*  So your answer to the concern about the tariffs is everything's going to be hunky dory. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=549.3399999999999s)]
*  Everything's going to be just fine. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=554.02s)]
*  It wouldn't have been if I didn't do this. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=555.9s)]
*  I had a choice. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=557.42s)]
*  I could leave it, have a nice, easy time. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=558.42s)]
*  But I think ultimately you would have had an implosion. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=560.18s)]
*  Our country had inflation that was worse than they've ever had it before. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=563.5799999999999s)]
*  You don't mention that. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=569.4s)]
*  Why don't you mention that we had the worst inflation probably in the history of our country. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=570.4s)]
*  People say for when you watch this, right, like doesn't it look like a deranged individual? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=575.5s)]
*  Like literally like this is the guy who's controlling the economy, who thinks a Photoshopped [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=581.1s)]
*  MS-13 is is real when it's obvious. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=587.86s)]
*  Obviously Photoshop, who's saying tourism is up when it's down. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=591.88s)]
*  Like we all see this. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=596.5799999999999s)]
*  Can we talk about that this is like a demented individual? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=598.68s)]
*  Then Donald Trump tries to throw his lawyers under the bus and says that when it comes [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=602.96s)]
*  to providing due process, he doesn't know anything about that. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=608.1s)]
*  His lawyers do play this clip. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=610.76s)]
*  Here, including terrorists, by the way. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=612.24s)]
*  Now, but did we give them a hearing when they came in? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=614.4s)]
*  Well, the law requires that every single person who is going to be deported gets a hearing [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=617.4399999999999s)]
*  first. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=622.92s)]
*  Do you acknowledge that? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=623.92s)]
*  I'll have to ask the lawyers about that. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=624.92s)]
*  All I can say is this. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=627.04s)]
*  If you're going to have 21 million people and we have to get a lot of them out because [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=628.6999999999999s)]
*  they're criminals, we're going to have to act fast. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=632.38s)]
*  We can't do you think we can give 21 million trials? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=635.5799999999999s)]
*  Let's say each trial takes two weeks. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=640.38s)]
*  Is that what you want us to do? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=642.6999999999999s)]
*  The law is the law, sir. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=643.6999999999999s)]
*  The law is the law. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=645.3s)]
*  And you're so in the whole thing about trials. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=646.3s)]
*  No, not trials, hearings. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=648.3399999999999s)]
*  I said these people came in. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=649.3399999999999s)]
*  They're not citizens. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=650.6999999999999s)]
*  They came in illegally. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=651.8199999999999s)]
*  They came into our country illegally. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=653.54s)]
*  We have to get them out. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=655.14s)]
*  There's a legal process for that. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=656.24s)]
*  I can't assure and we follow the legal process. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=657.24s)]
*  I can't. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=659.6s)]
*  I can't have a trial, a major trial for every person that came in illegally. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=660.78s)]
*  And Donald Trump's is asked a very simple question. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=666.4399999999999s)]
*  If he recommends that parents get their kids vaccinated for measles and Trump's like, ah, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=669.36s)]
*  let's leave it to the governors. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=674.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=675.1999999999999s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=676.1999999999999s)]
*  It's because people aren't getting their children vaccinated. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  Do you recommend to parents that they get their children vaccinated for measles? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=680.72s)]
*  Well, I recommend the governors to make the decisions. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=684.38s)]
*  You have a very talented governor of Texas and he's making decisions and those decisions [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=686.78s)]
*  are going to be made rapidly. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=692.02s)]
*  This is a very much different thing than COVID in terms of rapidity and speed and other things. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=694.02s)]
*  Measles have been with us a long time and I'm not saying good, bad or indifferent. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=700.14s)]
*  I'm just saying that the governors are making the decision. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=704.14s)]
*  It's a federalist decision. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=707.62s)]
*  The president is our leader in so many ways and your voice counts so much and you can't [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=709.6s)]
*  tell moms and dads it's a good thing to get a measles vaccine. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=716.6s)]
*  Do I recommend it? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=720.5200000000001s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=721.5200000000001s)]
*  I recommend it. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=722.5200000000001s)]
*  Do I mandate it? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=723.5200000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=724.5200000000001s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=725.5200000000001s)]
*  But I do recommend it. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=726.5200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=727.5200000000001s)]
*  Do you think you're... [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=728.5200000000001s)]
*  And I have recommended it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=729.5200000000001s)]
*  Do you think the secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=730.5200000000001s)]
*  history of at the very least vaccine skepticism, do you think Kennedy recommends the measles [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=732.24s)]
*  vaccine? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=738.0s)]
*  He did. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=739.14s)]
*  He recommended it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=740.14s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=741.14s)]
*  He was satisfied with his response. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=742.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he recommended that they go out and get the vaccine. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=744.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=748.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=749.14s)]
*  I truly believe that you could ask this guy any question and he'll say something crazy. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=750.14s)]
*  I think you can say, what color is the sky? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=755.5s)]
*  I'll leave it to the governors. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=757.98s)]
*  What year is it? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=761.58s)]
*  Do you think it's 2025? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=762.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=763.58s)]
*  What a fake question. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=764.58s)]
*  Like I truly think that if you asked him anything, like he is someone who clearly is not, you [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=765.96s)]
*  know, I'm not trying to give him an out by trying to say, oh, cognitive issues, but like [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=773.5200000000001s)]
*  he's a liar, he's dangerous, he's vile, he's a sexual abuser, he's a felon, he's a fraud, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=779.4000000000001s)]
*  and he's also seems to also be cognitively declined. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=785.5200000000001s)]
*  I mean, you see it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=788.36s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=789.36s)]
*  Here you've got Donald Trump saying that he thinks that Putin wants to stop the war. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=791.04s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=795.9s)]
*  He could be tapping me along a little bit. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=798.2199999999999s)]
*  I would say that he would like to stop the war. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=801.2199999999999s)]
*  I think that if it weren't for me, I think he'd want to take over the whole country personally. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=805.3s)]
*  I always felt so when I left, there wasn't even a chance that this would happen. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=810.42s)]
*  Biden got involved. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=817.4s)]
*  I won't say whether or not he handled it properly, but obviously it wasn't good because the war [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=818.92s)]
*  started. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=823.04s)]
*  Putin went in, the war started. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=824.04s)]
*  I believe that Putin wanted to get all of Ukraine once he went in. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=827.12s)]
*  And I think part of the reason he went in, he saw what happened in Afghanistan, how incompetent, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=830.56s)]
*  how incompetently Millian, all these guys handled that. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=835.16s)]
*  It was one of the greatest embarrassments of our lifetimes, but maybe in the history [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=837.7199999999999s)]
*  of our country. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=842.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=843.04s)]
*  I think Putin went in. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=844.04s)]
*  I think Putin wanted all of Ukraine. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=845.04s)]
*  I think if I didn't win the election, he would have gotten all of Ukraine. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=847.14s)]
*  I think he would have taken all of Ukraine. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=851.3399999999999s)]
*  I think his first choice... [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=853.14s)]
*  And then Donald Trump praises Doge, she says, for saving hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=854.3399999999999s)]
*  when they said they were going to save two trillion. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=860.62s)]
*  Actually, federal spending is up now. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=862.42s)]
*  More federal spending now under Trump than under former President Biden. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=864.98s)]
*  And Doge has added like 150 billion to our deficit. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=868.86s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=873.1s)]
*  And we ended that and those people are going to be suffering because of it. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=903.16s)]
*  A legal note, fraud is a crime. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=907.88s)]
*  There have been no referrals to the Justice Department on any of this. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=909.64s)]
*  Well, you don't know that, do you? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=911.84s)]
*  How do you know that? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=914.0400000000001s)]
*  Have there been referrals to the... [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=915.0400000000001s)]
*  Why would you know that, that there were no referrals? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=918.0400000000001s)]
*  I think there were referrals. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=921.2s)]
*  There generally are. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=922.2s)]
*  There's been no investigation from the Justice Department. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=923.2s)]
*  I'm asking you, sir. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=926.24s)]
*  No, you're not asking me. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=927.24s)]
*  You made a statement. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=928.24s)]
*  You're not asking me. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=929.24s)]
*  Now I'm asking you. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=930.24s)]
*  That was a statement that you made. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=931.24s)]
*  I'm asking you. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=932.38s)]
*  Have there been? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=933.38s)]
*  Yes, there have been. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=934.38s)]
*  So there have been referrals for fraud from the work of coverage. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=935.38s)]
*  Take a look at some of these things that took place. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=939.26s)]
*  Billions of dollars were given to people for no reason whatsoever. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=941.26s)]
*  Of course there have been. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=944.78s)]
*  I want to bring up... [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=945.78s)]
*  And then finally, Donald Trump is asked about the law firms that he's going after and here's [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=946.78s)]
*  what he says. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=951.54s)]
*  You've gone after law firms because they've employed people you don't like or they have [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=952.54s)]
*  represented people you obviously agreed because they paid me a lot of money. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=958.5s)]
*  And the reason they agreed is because you were threatening to destroy their business [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=962.56s)]
*  with your executive order that said you can't represent clients for the federal government. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=967.04s)]
*  These are big boys. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=970.88s)]
*  These are the biggest, most powerful lawyers. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=973.4399999999999s)]
*  These are not people that are easily intimidated. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=975.4399999999999s)]
*  As president, you've got all the cards. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=978.24s)]
*  They paid hundreds of millions of dollars because they felt, I guess, they probably [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=979.88s)]
*  felt they did something wrong. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=985.04s)]
*  It was for survival, sir. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=986.6s)]
*  You were crushing their business. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=988.0799999999999s)]
*  These firms are very powerful firms and there's 15 of them and these are firms that probably... [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=990.42s)]
*  Well, look, you have to ask them. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=997.94s)]
*  In fact, this is a separate story. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=999.42s)]
*  You have to ask them, why did you all pay Trump hundreds of millions of dollars in services, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1001.0600000000001s)]
*  et cetera? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1008.22s)]
*  Why did you do that? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1009.3000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1010.3000000000001s)]
*  You don't think that... [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1011.3000000000001s)]
*  We have a clause in each thing that while we admit no wrongdoing, but you know, it's [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1012.3000000000001s)]
*  like one of those things. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1017.14s)]
*  Now I'm friendly with those firms, but it's... [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1019.12s)]
*  You know, these are the most powerful firms in the world and they just signed whatever [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1021.96s)]
*  I put in front of them. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1027.1200000000001s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1028.24s)]
*  I'm actually surprised myself in a certain way, but they obviously felt they probably [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1029.72s)]
*  did something wrong. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1034.88s)]
*  I guess that's why they signed. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1035.88s)]
*  I guess the question out of that is the concern that people have. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1039.8s)]
*  Are you using your powers as president to get personal revenge? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1047.52s)]
*  I tell you what you're really not asking and you should be asking. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1049.46s)]
*  There has never been a president in this country, in the history, that was persecuted like I [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1053.82s)]
*  was persecuted by really crooked people, dishonest, horrible people, and it's been proven. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1060.1399999999999s)]
*  So when you say, I'm treating people rough, I'm not treating people rough, I was treated [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1067.78s)]
*  worse than any president in the history of our country. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1072.46s)]
*  And people figured, well, maybe that's it. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1076.8799999999999s)]
*  Finally we got... [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1079.3999999999999s)]
*  He's leaving town, there goes the helicopter. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1080.3999999999999s)]
*  And then I came back. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1083.0s)]
*  And I came back because I have tremendous support. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1084.9599999999998s)]
*  When you win an election like I won it, and you will admit I won all seven swing states, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1089.48s)]
*  I won the popular vote, I won 700, let's see, 2,750 districts compared to 500 districts. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1093.8799999999999s)]
*  That's why the map is all red. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1104.04s)]
*  And those people feel that I was treated unfairly. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1106.34s)]
*  But is that... [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1110.34s)]
*  What in the world are we watching? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1113.34s)]
*  We all have to look at that and go, again, this shouldn't be a political thing. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1114.84s)]
*  That ain't a normal person. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1118.8999999999999s)]
*  That's not behavior. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1121.6599999999999s)]
*  That's not the way adults behave. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1123.22s)]
*  That is somebody who honestly you would expect to see in... [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcGSQcoM5Q&t=1125.98s)]
