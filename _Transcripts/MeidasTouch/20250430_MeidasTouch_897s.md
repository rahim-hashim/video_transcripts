# PATHETIC Trump GOES NUTS as Plans are ALL RUINED
**MeidasTouch:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY)
*  It just keeps falling and falling, Donald. Consumer confidence is plummeting. Your approval ratings are plummeting. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=0.0s)]
*  The first 100 days in office, the worst stock market since Richard Nixon since 1973. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=8.24s)]
*  It's the Wall Street Journal headline. Trump's first 100 days were worse for Dow and S&P 500 since Nixon. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=16.8s)]
*  JP Morgan just came out with their findings that they believe first quarter GDP will be negative 1.8%, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=24.76s)]
*  not too dissimilar from the Atlanta Federal Reserve, which was predicting negative 2.5%. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=33.96s)]
*  Goldman Sachs is in the negative territory as well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=40.68000000000001s)]
*  You took a thriving Goldilocks economy that the Wall Street Journal said was the envy of the world [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=44.68000000000001s)]
*  under former President Biden, and you destroyed it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=51.4s)]
*  This is a real post I'm about to read for you right now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=54.6s)]
*  What is Donald Trump and his MAGA cult talking about? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=57.8s)]
*  Real post I'm reading right now from Lindsey Graham. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=61.0s)]
*  I was excited to hear that President Trump is open to the idea of being the next Pope. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=64.04s)]
*  This would truly be a dark horse candidate, but I would ask the Papal Conclave and Catholic faithful [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=70.28s)]
*  to keep an open mind about this possibility. He's not doing this as a joke, he's being serious. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=77.48s)]
*  Here's Donald Trump talking about how he wants to be the next Pope yesterday. Play this clip. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  You have to be a Pope. You have to be a Pope. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  As Pope? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=92.04s)]
*  I'd like to be Pope. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=92.76s)]
*  That would be my number one choice. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=94.68s)]
*  No, I don't know. I have no preference. I must say we have a cardinal that happens to be out of a [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  place called New York who's very good, so we'll see what happens. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=102.84s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump's been posting over and over again the following. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=106.04s)]
*  Promises made, promises kept. Promises made, promises kept. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=111.0s)]
*  Post after post after post like that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=115.4s)]
*  Donald Trump has the view, and this was a view from major, very dangerous propagandists, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=119.0s)]
*  if you repeat the same lie, an outrageous lie, over and over again, the bigger the lie, the better. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=126.04s)]
*  People will believe your big lie. 35% of our country has Maga Mushbrain who believes this stuff, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=134.12s)]
*  even if their own pensions are being destroyed, their jobs are being lost, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=142.2s)]
*  they're losing their health care. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=147.4s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to be the Pope. He says promises made, promises kept. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=149.8s)]
*  Donald Trump goes to war in Michigan and he says that he's reduced egg prices by 87%. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=154.12s)]
*  It's a total lie. It's just false. It's not even tethered anywhere near reality. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=159.56s)]
*  Donald Trump yesterday was in war in Michigan bragging about his accomplishments in the first [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  100 days. There are none. You destroyed our country. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=170.52s)]
*  I'm not being hyperbolic. Literally, you and Elon Musk and your billionaires [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  took a wrecking ball to our federal government. You destroyed essential services. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=180.36s)]
*  You destroyed the VA. You destroyed the Department of Education, the Consumer [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=186.28s)]
*  Financial Bureau, our parks. You have people raiding the African American Museum and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  the Smithsonian and destroying and getting rid of artifacts and things at the museum [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  because you say they're woke. But anyway, here's Donald Trump bragging about [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=203.32s)]
*  opening up the toilets. He did it. The toilets, everybody. Donald Trump gave us toilet bowls, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=208.6s)]
*  he says. Play this clip. I need everything I can get. I don't need to be under a shower [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=213.16s)]
*  trying to get water to come out of that damn thing. So we've opened up the shower heads, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=217.64s)]
*  the faucets, the toilets, the washing machines that don't give you water. All of that stuff has [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=224.04s)]
*  been opened up and we're giving you gas, ovens, gas stoves if you'd like. No more electric. You [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=232.2s)]
*  can have electric if you want. I have a lot of friends that like gas better. You're supposed [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  to sell your gas stove or get it. I don't know, who do you sell it to? Maybe another country [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=244.44s)]
*  because we're the only country that would be so stupid to that. But... And here, Donald Trump [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=248.2s)]
*  lies and says that the egg prices are down 87%. He's going to believe me when you get out there [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=254.2s)]
*  that it's Sleepy Joe Biden's fault. So, Brooke, you got to get going, Brooke, please. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=259.64s)]
*  And she did a great job. And you had so many eggs for Easter and your price was down 87% from that point. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=265.96s)]
*  Prices are coming way down. You know, the fake news doesn't say... They said, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=277.4s)]
*  he pledged... Now, I pledged safe orders, I pledged all sorts of things, but they said, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=281.4s)]
*  he pledged to bring prices down. Well, that's what I've done. They're trying to say the prices [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=286.28s)]
*  have gone up. Your energy, your car, your gasoline, they have three states this week, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=290.67999999999995s)]
*  a couple of days ago... Again, just a lie. Donald Trump sat for an interview with ABC as well that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=296.67999999999995s)]
*  aired yesterday. And Donald Trump says, you know, tourism, he says, is way up. There's never been [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=302.35999999999996s)]
*  more tourists coming to the United States right now. It's the biggest easy lie to prove in the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  world. But Donald Trump says, if you tell the big lie, that's all that matters. Here, play this clip. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=314.76s)]
*  And Canadians, many of them are really angry, furious about your talk about we're going to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=319.24s)]
*  take over Canada is going to become the 51st state. And it kind of is a piece of a lot of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=325.88s)]
*  travel is down into the United States from around the world. It feels like there's been [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  reputational damage. The country is doing great. Well, prices are down, gasoline's down, energy's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=336.52s)]
*  down. Tourism is going to be way up. When you see the numbers, the tourism is way up. Now Canada, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=342.68s)]
*  oh, tourism's doing very well. We're doing very well. We're doing very well. When you see the real [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=349.48s)]
*  numbers come out in about in six months from now, when you see the numbers... But do you think, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=354.92s)]
*  I'm going to ask you if I may, do you think that... And again, tourism right now is plummeting. Canada's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=359.88s)]
*  boycotting the United States. They've gone elbows up. Europe ain't coming to the United States. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=367.16s)]
*  Australia, they ain't coming to the United States. People who are planning trips to visit the United [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  States, they ain't coming. They don't want to be locked in detention centers or concentration camps [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=377.0s)]
*  and be cavity searched and separated from their families and who knows, sent to El Salvador. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  And then even when they get here, since Donald Trump's gutted essential services, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=388.20000000000005s)]
*  or is the food they're going to eat safe? I mean, people don't want to come to the United States. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=392.44s)]
*  Right now, I'm not sure you could put it in the comments if you're from another country so that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=397.32s)]
*  you can let Americans know foreign countries right now view the United States like North Korea. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=403.0s)]
*  Like they're not coming. Like they're like, we don't want to come there right now. Why would [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=409.72s)]
*  we come there? Right. So let me talk about this as well. United States Trade Representative Greer. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=414.76s)]
*  So he's now telling... This is real. He's telling GOP senators that there are some countries coming [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=422.92s)]
*  to the table for tariff talks. He says, but Europe's not engaging. Europe isn't really want [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=427.96s)]
*  to do a deal right now. But one of the things that Trade Representative Greer talked about is how [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=433.4s)]
*  Madagascar knows what we want. Cambodia and Vietnam know what we want. We are clear, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=440.03999999999996s)]
*  but Europe ain't getting it. As Carl Keaton says, well, at least Madagascar, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=446.12s)]
*  according to Greer, is going to kneel before us. I'm glad that that's their priorities. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=451.71999999999997s)]
*  When you go and you look at who Trump thinks is strong and who Trump thinks is weak, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=457.56s)]
*  shows you what a weak and pathetic person he is. He thinks Viktor Orban in Hungary, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=462.44s)]
*  who basically turned Hungary into a failed state, he thinks Orban is strong. Massive inflation there [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=466.92s)]
*  in contrast to their neighbor in Poland and Eastern Europe, which is a thriving democracy. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=473.88s)]
*  But Trump thinks Poland is weak and he thinks Hungary is strong. Donald Trump thinks El Salvador [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=480.04s)]
*  is strong. Their GDP is like what? $34 billion or $38 billion. It's not a thriving country. It's a [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=485.72s)]
*  poor Latin American country with a poverty rate of 25% and extreme poverty around 10%. All they [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=493.4s)]
*  have is CICOT, the concentration camp where they have the highest per capita imprisonment rate of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=502.44s)]
*  anywhere in the world. That's why Trump likes that. He thinks that's strong. It's not strong. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=508.44s)]
*  He thinks Javier Malé of Argentina, the huge poverty rate there, he thinks Malé is strong. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=513.0s)]
*  No, he's not. Canada is strong. European allies were strong. Australia is strong. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=518.76s)]
*  Japan is strong. But Donald Trump has such a warped view of that. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=526.68s)]
*  Doesn't this tell you everything you need to know right here? This is real what I'm about to show [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=535.24s)]
*  you. This is not an SNL skit. This is what the press briefing room looks like under Trump right [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=539.4s)]
*  now where they bring in right wing media and have special press briefings for right wing media. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=545.48s)]
*  I swear this looks just like an SNL skit. The questions are trolling or truthing. This is how [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=551.0s)]
*  they ask. Trolling or truthing? Taking over Canada, trolling or truthing? Watch this. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=557.72s)]
*  I was wondering if you'd indulge me in a quick round of Trump trolling or Trump truthing. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=563.64s)]
*  Sure, let's do it. Love it. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=568.2s)]
*  Okay, good. Happy fire. Greenland joining America. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=569.8000000000001s)]
*  Definitely Trump truthing. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=572.76s)]
*  Canada becoming a 51st state. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=575.96s)]
*  Trump truthing all the way. And the Canadians would benefit greatly, let me tell you that. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=577.16s)]
*  Eliminating the IRS? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=582.28s)]
*  I think that is an optimistic goal. And the president, so I would say we're on the side [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=584.44s)]
*  of truthing there for sure. And the president again wants to see tax cuts and he wants to see [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=590.76s)]
*  this massive revenue that we can gain from tariffs as well, which will create the external revenue [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=595.4s)]
*  service. So that's a definitive goal for sure. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=600.84s)]
*  Most importantly, Trump 2028. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=603.5600000000001s)]
*  Trump trolling. Although the hats are flying off the shelves. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=608.12s)]
*  I'm just thinking about how China's looking at this. Arbitrary as anybody. I mean, like [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=614.6800000000001s)]
*  Canadian Prime Minister Carney, former central banker looking at this, how they're looking. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=619.96s)]
*  They're like, what the hell is going on there? What in the Kim Jong-un is this? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=624.6s)]
*  Let me tell you what China's saying right now. China is responding to Trump tariffs with defiant [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=629.56s)]
*  propaganda clip comparing making a deal with Trump to drinking poison to quench thirst. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=635.0s)]
*  This from the China Foreign Ministry bowing to a bullies like drinking poison to quench thirst. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=641.0s)]
*  It only deepens the crisis. Speaking about crisis and crises, we learn that Pakistan has credible [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=647.4s)]
*  intelligence that India intends to launch a military strike within the next 24 to 36 hours. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=655.8000000000001s)]
*  That could happen any moment right now. Donald Trump creating more instability in the world [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=663.5600000000001s)]
*  right there. UPS announcing 20,000 job cuts at 73 facility closures as Amazon reduces its volume. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=668.6s)]
*  And what did Donald Trump spend yesterday doing as well? He called up Bezos and told Bezos [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=677.88s)]
*  to not put on Amazon the additional cost to consumers because of Trump's tariffs [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=685.4000000000001s)]
*  on the Amazon website. On Amazon, they were going to list the prices of the additions to the prices [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=693.48s)]
*  from tariffs. And Donald Trump and his regime called that a hostile, a political hostile attack [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=700.84s)]
*  and then said basically Bezos is just aligning with his friends in China. And like I can like [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=708.6800000000001s)]
*  Bezos is like a Chinese agent. That's like what they were saying. And then Trump called up Bezos [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=713.96s)]
*  and made Bezos take it down. So you remember during COVID where Trump was like, like a miracle, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=720.84s)]
*  it's all going to go away and don't test. If you slow down the testing, we don't know about [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=725.8000000000001s)]
*  the disease spreading. So we don't know what, so less cases, less testing. It's a version of that. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=730.84s)]
*  This is Donald Trump. He's a vile piece of trash. He's got a warped, sicko pathology. Like that's, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=736.76s)]
*  that's Donald Trump. Like he's a loser. He's bankrupted companies in the past. He's a big [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=742.28s)]
*  loser. He's not a builder. He's a destroyer. And this is one of the things that he does. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=747.24s)]
*  Don't deal with the problem. Cover it up. And then it doesn't exist. See, Donald, it's not the way [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=751.16s)]
*  the problems work. Problems get worse when you don't address them. And why I call your regime [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=755.3199999999999s)]
*  a Ponzi scheme presidency or a rug pull presidency is that it's cover up after cover up after cover [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=760.36s)]
*  up. And then eventually, you know what hits the fan and then there's a bankruptcy and there's an [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=765.4s)]
*  explosion. That's where you're heading. This is where this is heading to. If you look at our [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=769.8s)]
*  ports right now, you know I cover our ports. Freight volumes down significantly. Trucking [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=773.3199999999999s)]
*  volumes down significantly. Port of Seattle, not a lot of ships coming in. Port of Long Beach, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=778.3599999999999s)]
*  not a lot of ships coming in. You go look at Shanghai, you go look at other ports in China. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=784.8399999999999s)]
*  All the ships are there. And by the way, you know, they're, they're just not coming into the US. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=789.8s)]
*  $2 trillion in trading relationship with China is done, is basically an embargo right now. For what? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=794.92s)]
*  Like, like for what? And as China strengthens its hand internationally and Trump and these idiots [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=800.52s)]
*  are crushing our economy, the way I've described it, and I'll describe it again, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=806.4399999999999s)]
*  in a tsunami, the shore recedes, right? And then the tsunami hits. We're in the shore [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=810.52s)]
*  receding period. And with all of that, Trump's stock market, the worst since 1973. Even though [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=817.0799999999999s)]
*  the tsunami hasn't hit yet, the tsunami is going to hit. How do we know that? Because we can see [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=823.4s)]
*  that the ships aren't coming into the port, not getting the products. That's why we're seeing [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=829.88s)]
*  the market, the lending markets dry up. We're seeing that happen. We're seeing layoffs start [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=838.04s)]
*  and it's going to get worse. These things, and you're going to see this week the GDP report, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=844.76s)]
*  and it's not going to be good. And then the markets are going to be like, whoa, where did [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsLFSJHqmbY&t=850.52s)]
