# Trump has Extreme MELTDOWN as HE KILLS his OWN TERM
**MeidasTouch:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM)
*  Just go to sleep, Donald. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=0.0s)]
*  Just a complete and utter maniac. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=2.54s)]
*  All throughout the night, post after post, attacking ABC saying, I'm going to sue you [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=5.18s)]
*  if you keep talking about Qatar. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=11.02s)]
*  I'm going to sue you, stop talking about the plane. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  You've got Donald Trump also making posts accusing Hillary Clinton of like murder in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=16.94s)]
*  these weird conspiracy videos that he's posting, not to mention earlier in the day, Donald [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=23.16s)]
*  Trump was attacking Walmart. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=29.46s)]
*  He said Walmart's making too much money. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=31.18s)]
*  He says you got to eat the tariffs, Walmart. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=33.78s)]
*  You got to eat the tariffs, China. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=36.46s)]
*  Can this behavior is so unhinged? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=39.82s)]
*  I want to just go through what's going down here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  All of this is taking place as a new poll was just released showing Donald Trump's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=46.58s)]
*  approval is underwater in basically every major category. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=51.7s)]
*  When you start talking about the economy and foreign policy and tariffs, American people, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=57.72s)]
*  Democrats, Republicans, independents hate this guy. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=63.92s)]
*  It's the latest polling from a company and organization called Strength in Numbers Verisite. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=67.52s)]
*  When you go through specific policy areas, he has a net minus 32 point rating on prices [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=73.4s)]
*  and inflations, a minus 17 point net rating on jobs and the economy, a minus 21 when it [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=80.92s)]
*  comes to trade, a minus 20 on government funding, minus 17 on healthcare, on foreign policy, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=87.88s)]
*  minus 16 points on federal government workforce, minus 15, minus 16 points. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=95.72s)]
*  A lot of these were areas that Republicans used to do good at. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=102.88s)]
*  Donald Trump attacking James, Kony, Komi's daughter-in-law, and he calls him Kony. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=107.44s)]
*  James, Kony's daughter and son-in-law need to be relieved of their duties by the FBI. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=113.84s)]
*  They work in the federal government. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=119.48s)]
*  Not to mention Donald Trump posting weird, just fake AI videos of himself singing songs [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=121.68s)]
*  in front of fake crowds. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=128.78s)]
*  This behavior is completely unhinged. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=131.16s)]
*  You also have Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran saying the following about Donald Trump. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=134.44s)]
*  Some of the remarks made during the US president's trip to the region, to the Middle East, aren't [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=141.24s)]
*  even worth a response at all. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=146.6s)]
*  The level of those remarks is so low that they are a source of shame for the American [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=149.6s)]
*  nation. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=156.64s)]
*  Just think about that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=158.34s)]
*  You have the leader of Iran acting like a moral authority saying that, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=159.34s)]
*  I don't even need to respond to what Trump is saying. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=165.86s)]
*  He so shamed the United States of America. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=170.94s)]
*  It is just so utterly embarrassing for America right now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=174.2s)]
*  As an American, you know how embarrassing that is? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=177.54s)]
*  I said this elsewhere. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=181.14000000000001s)]
*  American media has so propagandized this Trump regime, and I'm not just talking about [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=184.5s)]
*  Fox. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=189.42s)]
*  Like, corporate news has tried to normalize all of this stuff, and they regurgitate Donald [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=190.42s)]
*  Trump's fake deals as headlines to make it seem like Trump did this great trip to the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=195.78s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=200.58s)]
*  And they spend their times talking about Biden and all these ridiculous things while Donald [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=201.58s)]
*  Trump's destroying the United States of America. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=206.06s)]
*  I don't think Americans fully appreciate how utterly disastrous this trip to the Middle [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=209.54000000000002s)]
*  East was and just how further it reinforced to the rest of the world what an unstable [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=215.62s)]
*  like gremlin creature like Kim Jong-un like this this mush of a human, if you want to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=221.46s)]
*  call him that is, and it just reinforced to the world like utter weakness. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=229.26000000000002s)]
*  I mean, they look at what Syria did, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=233.86s)]
*  The leader of Syria saw all these other countries bribing Donald Trump with Bitcoin deals and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=236.78s)]
*  with gold plated jets. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=244.94s)]
*  And so the leader of Syria is like, OK, here's what we're going to do. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  We want to get rid of the sanctions against us. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=250.32s)]
*  Let's just offer Donald Trump a Trump Tower Damascus. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=253.06s)]
*  Let's bribe him. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=256.58s)]
*  And then maybe we'll get some of the sanctions removed. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=257.62s)]
*  They offer him a Trump Tower Damascus. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=261.06s)]
*  And so, as a fact, Donald Trump meets with the leader of Syria and calls him a handsome [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=264.18s)]
*  man. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=268.5s)]
*  You're so handsome. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=269.5s)]
*  You're so good looking. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=270.5s)]
*  Look how handsome you are. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=271.5s)]
*  You're hot. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=272.5s)]
*  You're a handsome man, Trump says to the guy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=273.5s)]
*  And then he removes the tariffs against Syria. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=276.18s)]
*  This is going underreported as well, but I'm going to do a whole other video on it because [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=279.42s)]
*  I think it's very important. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=283.94s)]
*  So Donald Trump's family, who are 60 percent owners of this crypto venture that he does [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=286.26s)]
*  World Liberty Life or like World Life Crypto, whatever the hell it's called. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=291.38s)]
*  They did a deal underreported with Pakistan in late April, like six days after the terrorist [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=296.34s)]
*  attack in Kashmir. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=303.54s)]
*  The Trump family crypto, they own 60 percent of this company, did this crypto deal with [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=305.02s)]
*  Pakistan and it really has India infuriated. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=309.7s)]
*  And Prime Minister Modi is infuriated right now at Donald Trump trying to brag and take [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=315.06s)]
*  credit for negotiating the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=320.7s)]
*  And India is like, you had nothing to do with it at all. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=325.02s)]
*  And then Donald Trump's out there making fake, doing announcements claiming he did deals [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=328.21999999999997s)]
*  with India. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=332.82s)]
*  And India is like, we haven't done a trade deal with you. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=333.82s)]
*  Stop making up these things about India. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=337.65999999999997s)]
*  Stop lying about our country. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=340.38s)]
*  So that Pakistan crypto deal with the Trump family, that's gone underreported as well. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=343.14s)]
*  And just hear Trump is, you know, late at night, Saturday night, you know, it's like [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=348.82s)]
*  11 o'clock Eastern. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=354.86s)]
*  Why doesn't Chairman Bob Iger do something about ABC fake news, especially since I just [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=358.94s)]
*  won a 16 million dollars based on the fake and defamatory reporting of little George [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=367.54s)]
*  Slopidopoulos? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=373.74s)]
*  He was given warnings, but just couldn't be restrained by management. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=375.7s)]
*  Now I see they are at it again and I've given these sleazebags fair warning. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=380.0s)]
*  The wonderful country of Qatar, after agreeing to invest more than 1.4 trillion dollars in [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=385.34s)]
*  the United States of America, deserves much better than the misleading fake news. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=392.21999999999997s)]
*  Everyone, including their lawyers, has been told that ABC must not say that Qatar, Qatar [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=398.62s)]
*  is giving me a free Boeing 747 airplane because they are not. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=404.06s)]
*  Instead, and as fake news ABC fully knows, this highly respected country is donating [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=408.90000000000003s)]
*  a plan to the United States Air Force. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=413.94s)]
*  By the way, do you notice how the deal went from 1.2 trillion dollars to 1.4 trillion [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=416.58000000000004s)]
*  dollars? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=421.90000000000003s)]
*  The entire annual GDP of Qatar is 200 billion dollars. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=423.02000000000004s)]
*  Qatar can't make a 1.4 trillion dollar contribution without sacrificing 6 years or more, 7 years [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=432.06s)]
*  under your new fake number of its annual GDP. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=441.22s)]
*  It's just all an absolute lie. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=446.98s)]
*  And this is why you can't settle with Trump. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=451.46s)]
*  If you give him an inch, he takes your life. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=454.36s)]
*  He is an extorter, like quite literally. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=456.7s)]
*  He's a felon. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=459.78s)]
*  He is a fraud. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=461.3s)]
*  He is a sex abuser. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=463.06s)]
*  That's who he is. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=465.26s)]
*  He's a sexual, he's been found liable for sexual abuse. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=466.26s)]
*  He's a bankruptor. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=469.58s)]
*  You don't do deals with this guy. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=471.56s)]
*  You can't. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=473.90000000000003s)]
*  He's a crook. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=475.2s)]
*  He literally is a criminal. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=476.2s)]
*  You can't, you're going to go do deals with criminals and then go, oh my God, I got screwed [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=477.74s)]
*  by the felon. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=482.42s)]
*  I mean, the guy's a felon. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=483.42s)]
*  He's going to act like a felon. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=485.62s)]
*  He has no character. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=487.66s)]
*  He's a vile piece of trash. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=491.24s)]
*  Excuse my language. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  That's all. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  Sorry, Kirst. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=495.84000000000003s)]
*  That's all. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=496.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, that's who he is. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=497.84000000000003s)]
*  That's who his history is. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=500.56s)]

*  doing? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=513.36s)]
*  I like Jonah Goldberg who wrote this when Donald Trump was saying Walmart needs to stop [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=514.36s)]
*  blaming tariffs for raising its prices and they need to eat the tariffs. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=519.92s)]
*  Jonah Goldberg goes, I'm old enough to remember because I'm not a newborn infant when Trump [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=524.7199999999999s)]
*  said tariffs were paid by other countries. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=530.4799999999999s)]
*  How can Walmart eat tariffs when they're not already eaten by other countries? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=533.1999999999999s)]

*  While Donald Trump's out there whining like a little petulant baby, no offense to petulant [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=570.9200000000001s)]
*  babies who behave far more maturely than this. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=575.4s)]

*  I want to share with you this as well. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=583.88s)]
*  Spencer Kimian pointed this out. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=586.88s)]
*  American companies going to Europe to raise euros because it's more stable, easier and [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=589.0799999999999s)]
*  cheaper to borrow in Frankfurt than in New York. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=594.24s)]
*  Welcome to the upside down. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=597.72s)]
*  US companies are now tapping Europe's debt market at a record pace. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=599.56s)]
*  Attracted by lower borrowing costs on the continent and the chance to diversify their [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=604.0s)]
*  sources of funding and uncertainty over Donald Trump's tariffs triggers big market swings. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=608.6s)]
*  Strong demand from European debt investors has allowed US non-financial companies to [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=615.52s)]
*  borrow 40 billion euros in so-called reverse Yankee deals in which US groups raise money [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=620.86s)]
*  in the euro dominated bond market as of May 9th according to Bank of America data. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=627.56s)]
*  New deals worth multiple billions of euros have been priced since then. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=633.56s)]
*  If you're wondering the ramifications of Donald Trump's behavior as lots of top financial [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=640.2399999999999s)]
*  people have said, as I've said, Donald Trump has destroyed the American brand. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=647.2399999999999s)]
*  He's destroyed this idea that America is the stable place where you put your money. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=653.52s)]
*  It isn't anymore. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=658.4s)]
*  Companies are looking elsewhere right now. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=660.76s)]
*  Moody's, the credit agency that's been around since 1917, I reported on this yesterday, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=663.16s)]

*  They didn't downgrade the US credit score through the world wars, through great recessions, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=675.7199999999999s)]
*  through great depressions. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=685.04s)]
*  Now it's been downgraded because of Donald Trump's despicable behavior. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=687.16s)]
*  That's why. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=693.68s)]
*  That's what's going down right there. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=694.68s)]
*  A few other things I want to point out. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=696.4399999999999s)]
*  I think it's important to discuss. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=698.48s)]
*  One of them is horrific storms. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=700.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm going to do a whole other video on this. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=703.7199999999999s)]
*  Horrific storms in Kentucky, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=706.86s)]
*  Donald Trump's not mentioning it all. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=712.16s)]
*  You have in hard and post one thing about it. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=715.12s)]
*  Over 16 Americans have died in these horrific storms. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=717.64s)]
*  One of the things we're learning is that the storm forecasting was compromised by Doge's [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=723.4s)]
*  firings at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agencies and the National Weather Service, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=730.48s)]
*  NWS. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=740.96s)]
*  They didn't have the staff to even let people know about how bad these storms were going [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=742.24s)]
*  to be before. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=746.92s)]
*  Horrible stuff. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=749.2s)]
*  Donald Trump's not even acknowledging it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=750.2s)]
*  Another factor you know about the situation in the airports right now with air traffic [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=753.0s)]
*  control in multiple airports losing sight of their radar for minutes on end. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=759.08s)]
*  We've seen it happen in Denver. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=766.16s)]
*  We're seeing it happen in Newark. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=767.6800000000001s)]
*  We're seeing it happen in other airports. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=769.64s)]
*  We're going to learn about more airports over the coming weeks. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=771.24s)]
*  We know that. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=773.6800000000001s)]
*  But now in Newark, there's also a measles outbreak. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=775.24s)]
*  Newark airport under the Trump regime, come for the near-death flight experiences and [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=781.2s)]
*  delays, stay for measles. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=786.48s)]
*  And R.F.K. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=789.52s)]
*  Jr. will tell you that he thinks that he's not sure if you should even get vaccinated [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=790.52s)]
*  for it. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=794.92s)]
*  Of course you should. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=795.92s)]

*  What a ridiculous regime. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=800.3399999999999s)]
*  Let me play this video of Democratic Congress member Jamie Raskin to play us out. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=802.5799999999999s)]
*  I want you to hear what he has to say. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=808.18s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=811.42s)]
*  We're building a new Air Force One and we have an Air Force One. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=812.42s)]
*  So it's not like this is coming because the government is trying to requisition new property [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=817.3399999999999s)]
*  and putting out a bid for auction. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=822.6999999999999s)]
*  This is coming because Donald Trump liked a plane, like a five-year-old boy, and he [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=826.02s)]
*  decided he wanted that plane and he's been zeroed in on that plane and he wants to take [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=830.5799999999999s)]
*  his $400 million gift. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=835.26s)]

*  and it's not a personality test. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=841.54s)]
*  It's a constitutional test and it's up to Congress to determine whether that's in the [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=843.14s)]
*  national security interest of the United States and whether it's in the interest of the public [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsBoUTsJlM&t=847.22s)]
