# FURIOUS Pope Leo UNLEASHES on Trump INSIDE USA
**MeidasTouch:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g)
*  Uh-oh, Donald, you pissed off Pope Leo XIV. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=0.0s)]
*  You don't want to do that, Donald. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=4.16s)]
*  Pope Leo XIV is furious at Donald Trump, and he is taking action from the Vatican to help [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=6.24s)]
*  the migrants in the United States who are being viciously targeted by the Trump regime, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=13.9s)]
*  ripped away from their families, treated like trash as ICE agents tackle him and pummel [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=20.8s)]
*  him on the ground and engage in mass deportation in the most cruelest form. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=27.3s)]
*  Let me tell you what Pope Leo XIV specifically did on Friday, which is International Refugee Day. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=33.5s)]
*  So, Pope Leo XIV appointed a new bishop, someone by the name of Michael Pham. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=41.1s)]
*  Now, the newly appointed bishop, Bishop Pham, wrote a letter on June 11th asking fellow [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=48.1s)]
*  men of cloth in the San Diego area throughout the United States and elsewhere to come and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=56.34s)]
*  join him on June 20th, International Refugee Day. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=62.74s)]
*  And there were about 16 other very prominent leaders in the Catholic Church who joined him. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=68.5s)]
*  They went to the San Diego courthouses and they were ready to confront the ICE agents, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  the DHS agents who would normally be waiting in the courthouses to attack the migrants [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=81.3s)]
*  like we've been seeing take place across the United States. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=87.7s)]
*  This operation launched by Pope Leo XIV and led in San Diego by Michael Pham was highly successful. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=91.7s)]
*  And nobody got attacked. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=101.7s)]
*  Nobody got captured by ICE. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=103.7s)]
*  ICE backed off as a result of this operation led by Pope Leo XIV who appointed Michael Pham. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=106.5s)]
*  Our friend Pablo Manriquez wrote the following, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=114.5s)]
*  So here was the letter that Michael Pham from the Diocese of San Diego wrote to other men of cloth [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=136.5s)]
*  after being directed to do this by Pope Leo XIV in the Vatican who's furious at Trump's behavior, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=144.9s)]
*  at Trump's just treatment of migrants. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=153.14s)]
*  Dehumanization is the word that I'm looking for. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=157.29999999999998s)]
*  So here was the June 11th letter. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=160.1s)]
*  Let's go through what went down. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=161.94s)]
*  On the morning of June 20th, which is International Refugee Day, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=166.26s)]
*  a group of priests and faith leaders are planning to visit the Federal Court Building [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=172.26s)]
*  to stand in solidarity with migrants who are making their court appearances. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=178.1s)]
*  We know that migrants and refugees find themselves in the difficult predicament [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=182.74s)]
*  of being called to appear, which is what the government asks of them, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=187.78s)]
*  and then being given orders for expedited removal from our country. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=191.78s)]
*  This group of priests and faith leaders will simply be present during this process as it [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=196.78s)]
*  has been experienced that the presence of faith leaders makes a difference in how migrants [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=202.9s)]
*  are treated. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=208.3s)]
*  Unfortunately, it will most likely not change the outcome. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=209.86s)]
*  Following the court appearances, the faith leaders will have a press conference so that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=214.12s)]
*  the clear message is sent that people of faith stand with immigrants and refugees and that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=218.5s)]
*  that can be delivered to the broader public. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=225.18s)]
*  They will gather at 7 a.m. and conclude by 10 a.m. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=228.2s)]
*  If you feel moved to participate, please notify any of the following. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=232.22s)]
*  Being present will be a good way for us to give witness and stand with immigrants on [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=237.66s)]
*  a day on which across the diocese, we will celebrate a mass at our various parishes [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=242.64s)]
*  dedicated to our immigrant brothers and sisters. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=248.72s)]
*  Gratefully yours, Michael Pham is one of the signatories. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=252.48s)]
*  Now CBS 8 and San Diego and others were there and they are reporting that due to Bishop [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=256.52s)]
*  Michael Pham's presence in the courtroom, in effect, cases of migrants were postponed. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=262.7s)]
*  Nobody was deported, nobody was grabbed, nobody was attacked by ICE agents. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=270.82s)]
*  They would not go near the bishop. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=276.06s)]
*  Let me share with you what went down as Bishop Michael Pham, auxiliary bishops and priests [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=279.18s)]
*  in the diocese of San Diego. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=285.2s)]
*  Here they are celebrating mass before joining migrants in federal court. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=287.76s)]
*  Pham was the first bishop in the U.S. appointed by Pope Leo XIV. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  Let's show you this clip right here. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=298.58s)]
*  Now I want to remind you that San Diego has been a hotbed for ICE activity. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=329.58s)]
*  ICE has been trying to rip families apart in San Diego. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=335.94s)]
*  ICE has been trying to provoke the community of San Diego. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=340.46s)]
*  ICE has showed up militarized raiding restaurants and factories and trying to attack people [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=344.96s)]
*  on the streets, going through peaceful communities in San Diego. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=352.38s)]
*  Let me show you right here of what went down a few weeks back in the South Park area of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=357.48s)]
*  San Diego to remind you why this is a particularly important area that Pope Leo XIV has been [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=362.76s)]
*  very focused on. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=369.56s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=371.08000000000004s)]
*  Now, here is another video right here of residents in San Diego. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=387.48s)]
*  This was a few weeks back as well in early June. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=410.72s)]
*  Really pushing back on these ICE agents and these federal military, almost look like a [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=414.14s)]
*  paramilitary group. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=421.78s)]
*  Watch what happens when the community confronts them. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=424.09999999999997s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=426.44s)]

*  Now, let me share with you what has typically been going down when the bishops were not [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=556.48s)]
*  there. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=561.8s)]
*  What will normally happen is ICE will send out a letter to people who have court appearances, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=562.8s)]
*  or they will ask people, hey, you need to show up to renew your application, or people [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=569.64s)]
*  will just show up to court. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=574.24s)]
*  And then maybe someone is, they have to use the restroom or whatever, but then the ICE [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=576.6s)]
*  agents are hiding in the courthouse. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=582.2s)]
*  They're wearing their masks, because now in the United States we have Mas Gestapo a la [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=586.2s)]
*  the KKK a la Nazi Germany. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=592.16s)]
*  And these ICE agents are waiting in bushes. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=595.44s)]
*  They're waiting in bathroom stalls. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=597.9200000000001s)]
*  They're hiding in communities and they tackle you and they throw you to the ground. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=599.9200000000001s)]
*  They beat you. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=604.04s)]
*  Even if you're an American citizen, if you look a certain way, we've been seeing that [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=605.4200000000001s)]
*  happen. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=609.6s)]
*  I'll show you with an American citizen in a second. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=610.6s)]
*  Here's what went down when ICE agents were waiting outside of a bathroom. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=612.88s)]
*  A woman shows up for court. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=616.6s)]
*  She's going through her paperwork and the ICE agents wait for her and then arrest her [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=618.88s)]
*  and then get ready to send her out of the country and separate her from her family. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=625.4s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=628.72s)]
*  Estamos aquí compa, fuerza. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=643.24s)]
*  Yeah, so you're just going to go in the bathroom. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=661.24s)]
*  Cool. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=663.24s)]
*  Here's the going in place. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=664.24s)]
*  Now, here's just an example of ICE going after American citizens. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=672.24s)]
*  This isn't in San Diego, but this happened the other day. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=700.24s)]
*  This is what they'll do. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=705.24s)]
*  They'll go after, they'll try to beat you. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=706.24s)]
*  And then if you speak English and then you show them your ID, then they'll just walk [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=708.24s)]
*  away. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=714.24s)]
*  They wear their masks after pummeling you to the ground. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=715.24s)]
*  Here, watch this clip. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=717.24s)]
*  Here's how the Times of San Diego reports it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=730.24s)]
*  On World Refugee Day, masked immigrant agents weren't leaning against the off-white walls [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=741.24s)]
*  waiting to grab people. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=746.24s)]
*  They scattered Friday after seeing a clergy delegation led by Bishop-elect Michael Pham. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=747.24s)]
*  Ken Stone from the Times of San Diego. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=755.24s)]
*  Hat tip to you, Ken, for covering this. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=757.24s)]
*  Eight immigration courts lined the fourth-floor hallway of the downtown Edward Schwartz Federal [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=760.24s)]
*  Building. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=766.24s)]
*  On the walls, boot prints of ICE agents. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=767.24s)]
*  But on World Refugee Day, masked immigration agents weren't leaning against the off-white [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=770.24s)]
*  walls waiting to grab people. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=775.24s)]
*  They scattered Friday after seeing a clergy delegation led by Bishop-elect Michael Pham. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=777.24s)]
*  Like the story of Moses and Exodus, the Red Sea parted, said observer Scott Reed on the [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=783.24s)]
*  immigrant-aiding San Diego organizing project. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=789.24s)]
*  Said another observer, we've never seen the hallways cleared out so quickly. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=792.24s)]
*  The result? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=796.24s)]
*  Nobody was detained as immigration lawyers said it would happen. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=797.24s)]
*  Two cases were heard Friday morning by Judge Catherine Cate Holliday Roberts, a man whose [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=801.24s)]
*  case was continued and a woman whose case had been administratively closed for 20 years [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=808.24s)]
*  and reopened by the government. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=814.24s)]
*  Her case also was continued. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=816.24s)]
*  Jesuit priest Scott Santarosa, pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish in San Diego, brief [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=818.24s)]
*  camera crews and other media members who weren't allowed into the federal building. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=825.24s)]
*  Several reporters entered, including me, but didn't view the court proceedings. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=830.24s)]
*  Our presence made a difference, Santarosa said, quoting an immigration lawyer saying [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=834.24s)]
*  their client was given more time to prepare for another hearing. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=839.24s)]
*  Any other day, said a local activist, two to four immigrants would be detained by immigration [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=843.24s)]
*  and customs enforcement and taken away in vans operated by private prison corps civics. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=848.24s)]
*  In fact, at least two white vans were parked on an adjacent street with no license plate [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=854.24s)]
*  but padlocks on the side doors. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=860.24s)]
*  Bishop Pham himself, a Vietnamese refugee as a child, said ICE agents were standing [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=863.24s)]
*  there covered with masks as we walked toward the courtroom. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=869.24s)]
*  Eventually, the agents scattered and went away. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=872.24s)]
*  No wonder people come in fear. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=875.24s)]
*  Pham continued the mission of his predecessor, Cardinal Robert McElroy, also an outspoken [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=877.24s)]
*  advocate for immigrants, before leaving to be the Archbishop of Washington, D.C. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=883.24s)]
*  Pham said a government lawyer struck up a chat in the restroom. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=889.24s)]
*  He introduced himself to me, Pham told reporters. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=892.24s)]
*  He feels conflicted with the situation. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=895.24s)]
*  He knows his morals and his values. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=897.24s)]
*  It goes on to talk about how the Reverend Santarosa said masked ICE agents were an intimidating [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=901.24s)]
*  presence despite the fact that federal court staff were very incommodating. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=907.24s)]
*  Immigrants said they came with great fear and trepidation. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=912.24s)]
*  The Reverend Manny Del Rio of St. John of Cross and Lemon Grove echoed others. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=916.24s)]
*  It was evidence that our presence made a difference. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=920.24s)]
*  That was one of the last peaceful times in a long time with no immigrants being detained. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=923.24s)]
*  Besides 10 clergy members and the press, at least a dozen activists assembled outside [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=928.24s)]
*  the building and handed out sheets in English and Spanish titled, Know Your Rights. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=933.24s)]
*  All things are possible with God, Santarosa told the Times of San Diego. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=940.24s)]
*  This is a need that arises. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=944.24s)]
*  I think we could conceivably come up with a schedule where some priests could be court [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=946.24s)]
*  witnesses and accompany immigrants. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=950.24s)]
*  Very powerful, powerful stuff right there. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=953.24s)]
*  And to our international audience who's witnessing the fascism in America as masked agents are [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=957.24s)]
*  all throughout our streets now looking at people who with brown skin or black skin or [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=963.24s)]
*  whatever and tackling them, pummeling them to the ground, disappearing human beings off [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=970.24s)]
*  the street here in the United States. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=976.24s)]
*  There's full-fledged fascism taking place in our country, full-fledged authoritarianism. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=978.24s)]
*  It's not a constitutional crisis. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=983.24s)]
*  We're beyond that. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=985.24s)]
*  America is ruled by a dictator, an idiotic one too. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=987.24s)]
*  I mean, not an idiotic but a specifically stupid dictator. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=991.24s)]
*  And we have a Gestapo. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=995.24s)]
*  We have a secret police, masked officers attacking communities and going in and conducting [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=997.24s)]
*  raids. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=1003.24s)]
*  And no wonder tourism to the United States is plummeting. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=1004.24s)]
*  And obviously you see a furious pope at the Vatican who's always been someone, Pope Leo [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=1008.24s)]
*  XIV, outspoken and very supportive of immigrants taking decisive action here, which is always appreciated. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6-wp6Z5P1g&t=1013.24s)]
