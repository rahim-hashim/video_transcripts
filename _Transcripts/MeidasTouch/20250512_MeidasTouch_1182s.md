# Republicans LOSE IT on LIVE TV over Trump DESTROYING GOP
**MeidasTouch:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4)
*  The MAGA Republican leaders had a series of disastrous appearances on Sunday news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=0.0s)]
*  Let me just break down for you what took place. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=7.44s)]
*  And it's just shocking the audacity of this corruption and incompetence. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=10.4s)]
*  For example, here you have Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on air traffic control systems. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=15.68s)]
*  He says, the lights are blinking. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=23.76s)]
*  This is like an emergency moment, folks. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=25.76s)]
*  We may be in serious trouble. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=28.16s)]
*  This is the Transportation Secretary saying, I don't know, fix it? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=30.48s)]
*  Do your job, maybe? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=34.64s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=58.16s)]
*  Maybe we shouldn't be getting our Transportation Secretaries from the real world road rules [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=81.84s)]
*  challenge. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=87.44s)]
*  Maybe we should have people working to actually fix things instead of people like Sean Duffy [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=88.44s)]
*  who are posting like bachelor photos of himself saying, hashtag, Latino wife, saying that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=93.48s)]
*  his wife made him carne asado tacos. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=101.04s)]
*  What the hell are we talking about here? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=103.88s)]
*  That's what he actually posted. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=105.44s)]
*  Here is Sean Duffy again talking about how concerned he is about all of the airspace. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=107.92s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=114.26s)]
*  You talked about the fact that this might not be confined to Newark. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=115.26s)]
*  Are there other airports that you are concerned about right now? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=117.84s)]
*  I'm concerned about the whole airspace. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=120.8s)]
*  The equipment that we use, much of it, we can't buy parts for new. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  We have to go on eBay and buy parts if one part goes down. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=128.32s)]
*  You're dealing with really old equipment. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=131.88s)]
*  We're dealing with copper wires, not fiber, not high speed fiber. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=133.2s)]
*  This is concerning. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=138.28s)]
*  Is it safe? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=140.56s)]
*  Yes, we have redundancies, multiple redundancies in place to keep you safe when you fly. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=141.56s)]
*  But we should also recognize we're seeing stress on an old network and it's time to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=146.56s)]
*  fix it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=151.26s)]
*  Bottom line, is it safe to fly in the United States right now? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=152.26s)]
*  Listen, we are the safest airspace for sure. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=155.44s)]
*  Traveling by air is way safer than any other mode of transportation, which is why I take [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=159.68s)]
*  it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=163.56s)]
*  My family takes it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=164.56s)]
*  But again, that doesn't mean you don't look over the horizon and say, hey, if there is [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=166.52s)]
*  a major outage, could that be a risk to life? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=169.28s)]
*  Of course it could be, which is why we fix it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=171.96s)]
*  By the way, you know who spent his time actually working and doing things and making things [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=174.04s)]
*  better and not whining and complaining and panicking on TV? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=179.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  Maybe the last transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, who now all the MAGA Republicans [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  and before want to attack all the time. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  Maybe that was a better style of leadership than whatever the hell this is. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=193.32s)]
*  And speaking of whatever the hell this is, MAGA Republican Congress member Michael McCaul [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=197.44s)]
*  addresses Donald Trump and Trump's top adviser, Stephen Miller, threatening to suspend habeas [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=203.2s)]
*  corpus, in other words, shred the Constitution so they can throw anybody they want in concentration [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=209.88s)]
*  camps without the federal courts by claiming fake invasions. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=216.32s)]
*  This is Congress member McCaul, who seems to think it's a good idea. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=221.6s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=226.6s)]
*  This past week as well, White House senior adviser Stephen Miller said habeas corpus [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=227.6s)]
*  can be suspended at the time of an invasion, saying the administration's looking at ways [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=232.88s)]
*  to potentially do away with due process for undocumented immigrants. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=237.74s)]
*  You're an attorney. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=242.06s)]
*  You're someone who deals with Homeland Security issues and immigration being there from the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=243.06s)]
*  Lone Star State. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=246.48s)]
*  Is suspending habeas corpus for undocumented immigrants a good idea? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, this was done by President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  It's a very extreme measure to take. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=256.72s)]
*  Any person in the United States under the Constitution has due process rights. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=260.04s)]
*  So I think the courts are going to decide this one as to whether this invasion in fact [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=266.44s)]
*  constitutes what would be a state of war. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=271.72s)]
*  Some would say it would. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=274.88s)]
*  Well, my state of Texas seen invasion and the drug cartels and the danger that they [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=276.64s)]
*  bring into my state and in this country. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=281.68s)]
*  I think that would be a very interesting legal argument before the courts. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=286.0s)]
*  Well, curious to call it an invasion, especially when the administration likes to remind us [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=289.76s)]
*  that the border crossings are a court-centered historic law. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  So that'll be part of the legal debate, I suppose. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=296.2s)]
*  They have gone down substantially, yes. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=299.32s)]
*  They sure have. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  So, shifting gears to MAGA Republican Senator Barrasso from Wyoming. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=302.92s)]
*  He asked, he's asked a question about Donald Trump and the regime statement that little [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  girls should now just have one doll, one pencil and pay more for it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=314.48s)]
*  That the Trump regime is imposing central planning on Americans and American children, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=319.48s)]
*  telling them the amount of pencils and dolls that they can have. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=325.56s)]
*  And Barrasso's like, he's a master at messaging. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=329.16s)]
*  This is how you do it here, play this clip. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=332.72s)]
*  I want you to listen to a part of my interview with President Trump when he talked about [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=334.6s)]
*  what this could mean for supplies. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=341.04s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=343.36s)]
*  I'm just saying they don't need to have 30 dolls. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=344.36s)]
*  They can have three. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=347.36s)]
*  They don't need to have 250 pencils. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=348.36s)]
*  They can have five. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=350.24s)]
*  Senator, what do you say to people who hear those words and feel like the president is [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=352.24s)]
*  telling them to ration their goods? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=357.6s)]
*  Well, the president, I think, is very effective at using the bully pulpit. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=362.23999999999995s)]
*  And he is using it, I think, to show strength and leadership of America. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=367.28s)]
*  A week ago, you would have never foreseen the discussions going on in Switzerland this [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=372.28s)]
*  week between our trade representative, our secretary of treasury and China. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=376.79999999999995s)]
*  We wouldn't have foreseen the deal with Great Britain. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=381.88s)]
*  We wouldn't have seen the call for the ceasefire and Putin agreeing to have peace talks. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=384.84s)]
*  The president is very effective at using the bully pulpit. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=390.24s)]
*  Well, at the same time, Donald Trump is saying, little girls, you get one pencil and you get [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=393.72s)]
*  one doll. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=399.48s)]
*  Donald Trump's accepting gifts from Qatar in the form of $400 million airplanes that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=400.88s)]
*  he's going to fly around in. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=407.36s)]
*  And the gift is such that Donald Trump gets to keep it after he leaves the presidency. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=408.92s)]
*  It belongs to Donald Trump through his presidential library is what they're calling it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=414.36s)]
*  The corruption is astounding and the incompetence is as well. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=419.96s)]
*  Here's one of Donald Trump's top advisors as well as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=424.0s)]
*  who again lies about tariffs and says that tariffs don't make things more expensive. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=428.79999999999995s)]
*  Is the 10 percent tariff that we're seeing in the framework for the UK going to be in [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=434.28s)]
*  place for the foreseeable future? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=439.52s)]
*  So we do expect a 10 percent baseline tariff to be in place for the foreseeable future, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=443.64s)]
*  but don't buy the silly arguments that the U.S. consumer pays. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=448.92s)]
*  Businesses, their job is to try to sell to the American consumer and domestically produced [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  products are not going to have that tariff. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=460.8s)]
*  So the foreigners are going to finally have to compete. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=463.72s)]
*  They're going to have to compete. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=467.56s)]
*  What happens is the businesses and the countries primarily eat the tariff. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=468.56s)]
*  You've got Senator Barrasso asked another question. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=473.48s)]
*  He's the senator from Wyoming. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=478.48s)]
*  And here he's asked, what's your message to the people of Wyoming who have to pay more? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=480.4s)]
*  And Senator Barrasso is like, people love it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=485.52s)]
*  They love paying more. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=488.08s)]
*  Whatever Donald Trump tells us here in Wyoming, we do. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=489.36s)]
*  He says, you pay more, we pay more. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=492.44s)]
*  He says, one dollar, one dollar. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=494.36s)]
*  Whatever dear leader says. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=496.2s)]
*  The hell? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=497.36s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=498.36s)]
*  Administration, you express real concerns that prices have increased at stores like [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=499.36s)]
*  the Dollar Tree, for example, which you talked about how important a store like that is to [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=503.71999999999997s)]
*  Wyoming, to rural communities in particular. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=508.48s)]
*  And now the Dollar Tree says that the tariffs could actually push them to raise prices again [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=511.08000000000004s)]
*  and that they may not be able to stock some of their goods. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=516.44s)]
*  What do you say, Senator, to the people of Wyoming who hear that, who rely on stores [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=519.8000000000001s)]
*  like the Dollar Store? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  And they're worried. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=526.24s)]
*  Well, I travel around Wyoming. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=529.24s)]
*  People in Wyoming are very happy with the president and what he's doing to help our [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=530.9200000000001s)]
*  economy. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=535.4s)]
*  Prices are just one tool as part of our comprehensive economic plan. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=537.0s)]
*  We're trying to get that passed in the very near future in Congress, focused on both the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=540.56s)]
*  safety and the prosperity of the American people. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=545.56s)]
*  We are focused on lowering prices, raising wages and bringing jobs back to America. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=548.92s)]
*  And that's our focus right now in Congress. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=555.3s)]
*  Are you looking for something simple and delicious to add to your wellness routine? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=557.52s)]
*  I used to rely on regular honey for my breakfast, tea and even salad dressings. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=560.92s)]
*  But then I found Manukura and let me tell you, it puts all other honey to shame. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=565.44s)]
*  Manukura honey is rich, creamy and the most delicious honey I've ever had. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=569.52s)]
*  The best part? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=573.36s)]
*  It's ethically produced by master beekeepers in the remote forests of New Zealand. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=574.36s)]
*  These bees collect nectar from the Manuka tea tree, which is packed with bioactives, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=578.52s)]
*  giving Manukura three times more antioxidants and prebiotics than your average honey. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=582.52s)]
*  Each morning, I start my day with a heaped teaspoon of Manukura, letting the creamy texture [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=587.8000000000001s)]
*  melt in my mouth and coat my throat. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=591.86s)]
*  And it's not just a treat, it's packed with powerful nutrients to support my immunity [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=594.24s)]
*  and gut health. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=597.6s)]
*  And here's something that sets Manukura apart. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=598.6800000000001s)]
*  It contains a special antibacterial compound called MgO, which comes from the Manuka tea [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=600.84s)]
*  tree. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=606.24s)]
*  Manukura tests every harvest for MgO, and you can see the results yourself through their [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=607.24s)]
*  QR system. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=611.6800000000001s)]
*  It's a honey with superpowers. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=613.24s)]
*  Whether you're adding it to your food or enjoying it straight off the spoon, it's [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=615.44s)]
*  a game changer. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=618.84s)]
*  Now, it's easier than ever to try Manukura honey. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=619.84s)]
*  Just head to Manukura.com slash mitis, that's M-E-I-D-A-S, to get $25 off the starter kit, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=623.32s)]
*  which includes an MgO 850 plus Manuka honey jar, five honey travel sticks, a wooden spoon, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=630.4000000000001s)]
*  and a guidebook. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=637.5200000000001s)]
*  That's Manukura.com slash mitis for $25 off your starter kit. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=638.7600000000001s)]
*  Start your mornings with Manukura. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=644.6400000000001s)]
*  You'll never go back to ordinary honey. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=646.36s)]
*  Next you have MAGA Republican Senator Tom Cotton. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=648.8800000000001s)]
*  He's asked a question here about Trump's special envoy to Russia, Steve Witkoff, using Kremlin [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=653.22s)]
*  interpreters and not going through the U.S. embassy. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=660.46s)]
*  And again, if you're MAGA, you got to be in the cult. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=663.4200000000001s)]
*  So according to Tom Cotton, this is brilliant. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=667.22s)]
*  If Trump says use the Putin interpreters, use the Kremlin interpreters, show up Witkoff [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=669.6600000000001s)]
*  with no one from the embassy and no one who knows Russian. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=675.86s)]
*  Just show up on your own and use a Kremlin interpreter. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=678.72s)]
*  Here's what Cotton says. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=681.78s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=682.78s)]
*  NBC's reporting this weekend that special envoy Steve Witkoff, during three high-level [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=683.78s)]
*  meetings with Putin, didn't use his own interpreter, instead using an interpreter from the Kremlin. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=687.5799999999999s)]
*  Michael McFaul, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, told them this. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=692.8199999999999s)]
*  He said using the Kremlin's interpreter was, quote, a very bad idea that put Witkoff at [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=695.54s)]
*  a real disadvantage. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=699.62s)]
*  McFaul went on to say, I speak Russian and have listened to Kremlin interpreters and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=701.66s)]
*  U.S. interpreters at the same meeting and the language is never the same. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=704.86s)]
*  Why would we agree to that? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=710.14s)]
*  Well, first, I don't necessarily credit that reporting. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=711.54s)]
*  But second, Steve Witkoff is a very skilled and capable negotiator. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=715.02s)]
*  He has the president's total trust and he's 100% loyal to the president. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=718.74s)]
*  He's doing what the president has asked to try to get Vladimir Putin to the table with [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=723.18s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky to get to a ceasefire. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=728.3s)]
*  So I have confidence that that's what he's doing on the Ukraine dispute, just like I [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=731.02s)]
*  have confidence in what he's doing right now in Oman negotiating with Iran over its nuclear [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=735.5s)]
*  program. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=739.66s)]
*  That's what they're going with here. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=740.66s)]
*  Here's Lutnik again. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=742.18s)]
*  Again, some call this guy Nutlick. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=743.18s)]
*  Some call him Lutnik. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=744.86s)]
*  You can call him whatever you want to call him. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=746.0999999999999s)]
*  Here he is on what his message is to dock workers who are losing their jobs. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=748.14s)]
*  His message to the longshoremen is enjoy it. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=753.6999999999999s)]
*  You deserve it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=756.78s)]
*  You deserve not to have your job. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=757.78s)]
*  You don't believe me? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=759.26s)]
*  This is what he says. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=760.42s)]
*  This is his own words. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=761.42s)]
*  Scott reports out on the West Coast that there are hundreds of dock workers now out of work [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=762.42s)]
*  as those ships are not coming in. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=766.2199999999999s)]
*  The ripple effect there hitting the trucking industry and others as well. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=767.8199999999999s)]
*  One union official out there says it's beginning to manifest itself as real loss of jobs and [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=771.78s)]
*  income from our members. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=776.9s)]
*  So what do you say to those American workers? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=778.54s)]
*  I say to those American workers, Scott Bessent is in Geneva right now talking to his counterparties [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=780.5799999999999s)]
*  in China, right? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=787.38s)]
*  Remember, this is just a China problem right now, right? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=788.5s)]
*  We have 145% tariff. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=791.98s)]
*  They have 125% tariff. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=792.98s)]
*  Those tariffs are too high to do business. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=796.24s)]
*  But that's why they're talking right now. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=798.0600000000001s)]
*  The rest of the world is 10%. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=800.58s)]
*  So don't overdo it. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=802.82s)]
*  The rest of the world is 10%. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=804.02s)]
*  They're sending their goods here, as the president has said time and time again. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=807.02s)]
*  We are the consumer of the world. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=810.84s)]
*  Everybody wants to sell their goods here. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=814.66s)]
*  So they need to do business with America. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=816.64s)]
*  And we're using the power of our economy to open their economy to our exporters. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=818.74s)]
*  So that is happening right now. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=824.74s)]
*  Yes, Scott Bessent is in Geneva talking to his counterparties right now. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=827.1800000000001s)]
*  And let's see what happens. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=833.38s)]
*  But the president said last night he was very optimistic and very positive. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=835.24s)]
*  So you should be very optimistic and positive because the president truth it out and I rely [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=838.98s)]
*  on the president. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=843.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=844.5s)]
*  Could you imagine for a second if this was the type of thing that was coming out from [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=845.74s)]
*  a democratic administrator? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=850.46s)]
*  I mean, could you imagine it for a second? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=851.74s)]
*  So why are we here not calling it out here on the Midas Touch Network? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=855.14s)]
*  Over here we have Kristen Welker speaking to Sean Duffy, interviewing him. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=860.82s)]
*  And she's like, but I know you're complaining about your staff at the FAA, but you're the [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=866.6s)]
*  transportation secretary. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=872.44s)]
*  Weren't you and Musk like firing these people and now you're complaining that you don't [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=874.44s)]
*  have enough staff? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=878.32s)]
*  Maybe should you not have fired them? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=879.32s)]
*  Here's what his response is. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=881.32s)]
*  You're saying some were fired, some were brought back. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=882.8000000000001s)]
*  People will hear that. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=885.48s)]
*  I think it sounds a little bit chaotic. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=886.48s)]
*  I guess the bottom line is, did Elon Musk ask you to cut air traffic controllers directly? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=887.48s)]
*  So listen, we were having a conversation about who do we preserve? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=894.0400000000001s)]
*  And again, I wanted in those probationary employees to preserve air traffic controllers. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=898.32s)]
*  We went back and forth and Elon agreed, the president agreed, of course you want to keep [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=902.76s)]
*  air traffic controllers. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=906.2s)]
*  We're trying to hire more of them. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=907.36s)]
*  But I think the key is, can your government be more efficient? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=909.36s)]
*  We've had a massive expansion of government. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=912.52s)]
*  You can actually be more efficient and still accomplish the mission of safety, which is [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=914.8199999999999s)]
*  what I think we can do. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=918.96s)]
*  And actually, we are doing that. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=919.96s)]
*  Did Elon Musk though initially ask you to cut air traffic controllers? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=921.76s)]
*  And did you dispute that? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=926.4s)]
*  Did you have a disagreement with him? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=927.88s)]
*  So Elon and I get along really well. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=928.88s)]
*  He never called me and said, cut air traffic controllers. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=930.36s)]
*  He would never do that. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=932.24s)]
*  This was a broader conversation about what positions are going to be preserved. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=933.6s)]
*  Also, I don't want to even show this clip because it's so disgusting. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=937.28s)]
*  But on OAN, the other right wing propaganda network, Matt Gaetz and MAGA Republican Congress [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=941.12s)]
*  member Andy Ogles were doing interviews in front of the CICOT prison cells, which is [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=946.8s)]
*  a violation of the Geneva Convention to parade yourself in front of prisoners like that for [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=953.52s)]
*  the purposes of spreading propaganda. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=959.32s)]
*  They do the interviews while the people are in the jail cells behind them. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=961.16s)]
*  It is cosplay fascist theater right there. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=966.92s)]
*  And now, can I just contrast this here to what I think are actually good interviews, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=970.76s)]
*  like from Michigan University economics professor Justin Wolfers, who talks about what these [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=976.14s)]
*  quote unquote trade deals that Trump's doing really is about. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=983.0799999999999s)]
*  The deal with the UK is now, the sole thing it achieved is that UK luxury cars can get [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=987.92s)]
*  into the United States cheaper while screwing over American manufacturers. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=995.4799999999999s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=999.88s)]
*  We tariff cars differently than we tariff other goods. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1000.88s)]
*  But of course, when it comes to British cars, we have a lower tariff on British cars. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1003.92s)]
*  So apparently we should be buying British cars, but not Canadian cars. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1008.64s)]
*  By the way, you know what kind of cars we import from Britain? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1012.28s)]
*  Rolls Royces, Bentleys, Aston Martins, Jaguars, Land Rovers and Minis. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1016.2s)]
*  I think I pretty much just described the Mara Lago parking lot right there. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1025.56s)]
*  But it really is a stunning thing. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1029.8s)]
*  I want you to imagine for a moment that you're in the room with the president and the pollster [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1032.8s)]
*  says we're having trouble selling these tariffs. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1036.8s)]
*  People are worried about the distributional implications. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1039.72s)]
*  They're worried, of course, because these tariffs hurt working in middle class Americans [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1043.12s)]
*  the most. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1046.9599999999998s)]
*  And then the president says, I know how to fix that. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1047.9599999999998s)]
*  Why don't we have a special tariff carve out? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1049.9599999999998s)]
*  Maybe we'll call it the Rolls Royce carve out for Rolls Royces, Bentleys, Jaguars, Aston [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1053.0s)]
*  Martins and Land Rovers. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1057.32s)]
*  That will please the punters. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1060.28s)]
*  And by the way, it's literally the only tariff carve out in the UK, US trade deal on consumer [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1062.1999999999998s)]
*  goods is expensive British cars. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1068.6399999999999s)]
*  Here's what Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar had to say play this clip. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1071.32s)]
*  But to me, you know what? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1077.36s)]
*  That isn't really the issue. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1078.62s)]
*  The issue is that Stephen Miller brings that up on a Friday just to throw it out there. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1080.06s)]
*  You heard the reaction of John Barrasso. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1085.0s)]
*  This is not what they're talking about in Congress. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1087.2s)]
*  Why is he doing that? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1089.4399999999998s)]
*  So you ask me about it on a Sunday show. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1090.48s)]
*  I'm telling you right now, he's doing it because they don't want to focus on what's really [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1093.1599999999999s)]
*  in front of them and that they have created havoc in our economy, economy that was improving. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1098.2s)]
*  And now we have people out there scared to death that they're not going to be able to [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1104.6399999999999s)]
*  get their Social Security because people aren't working there to answer their calls. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1109.8s)]
*  They're not going to be able to get their Medicaid and be able to have their mom in [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1113.94s)]
*  assisted living. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1118.1s)]
*  And yeah, their small businesses are folding. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1119.54s)]
*  That's what's happening right now. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1122.36s)]
*  And they don't want to deal with it. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1123.8s)]
*  So they keep throwing out these things just so we all talk about them for four days. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1125.24s)]
*  And I am frankly tired of it because no, they're not going to reverse habeas corpus in the [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1130.08s)]
*  Congress. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1135.48s)]
*  That's not. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1136.48s)]
*  And so you can contrast that for yourself right there. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1137.48s)]
*  But that was the weekend appearances. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1140.52s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1142.28s)]
*  I mean, look, I want you to look at it. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1143.8s)]
*  I just want to exert common sense here, right? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1145.84s)]
*  I mean, we see what's going on. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckLD5TVs4X4&t=1148.24s)]
