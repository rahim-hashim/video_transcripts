# Trump has DISASTER DAY as his WAR BACKFIRES
**MeidasTouch:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE)
*  This has been a terrible Sunday for Donald Trump, but frankly for the entire United States, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=0.0s)]
*  as we're seeing the ramifications of Donald Trump's military strikes in Iran, where he and Netanyahu [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=5.76s)]
*  essentially went it alone. We're learning that the Fordow nuclear site was not even entirely [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  destroyed. It appears to have been damaged, but again not entirely destroyed, which was the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=21.04s)]
*  central mission, which does not seem to have been a success. We're also now learning that [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=27.44s)]
*  here's the response from Iran's ministers. America must receive a response for their aggression, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=35.6s)]
*  which was on a call between Iran's top leaders and France. The United States is now ordering [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=43.84s)]
*  family and non-emergency government personnel to leave Lebanon immediately. Our top threat assessment [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=50.64s)]
*  within the United States government is that the United States now faces a heightened [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=60.24s)]
*  terrorism threat as a result. The Iranian foreign minister, Ara Gitchi, is planning on visiting [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=65.2s)]
*  Moscow on Monday to meet with Vladimir Putin. This was reported by NBC First. He said he plans [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=73.04s)]
*  to travel to Moscow on Monday to meet with Putin to discuss how they can be jointly responding [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=81.28s)]
*  to the United States attack on the nuclear sites. China has issued a statement strongly [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=90.4s)]
*  condemning the United States attacks on Iran and bombing of nuclear facilities. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=96.8s)]
*  The actions of the U.S. seriously violate the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  international law. That's what China put out in a statement. It was originally reported also that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=108.64s)]
*  Iran's parliament has approved the closing of the Hormuz Strait. That's where all of the oil tankers [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=115.36s)]
*  have to pass through when they're traveling with all of the oil. From the Middle East, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=124.16s)]
*  you shut down the Hormuz Strait and oil becomes essentially inaccessible and unaffordable [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  in the United States. It was reported that the top security body in Iran is now making the final call [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=137.92s)]
*  after parliament approved it. There was then a wrinkle on that, that it wasn't a formal approval [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=145.6s)]
*  by the parliament, but they gave unanimous consent to shut down the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=150.8s)]
*  But the decision now lies with the Supreme National Council in terms of how they intend [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=158.96s)]
*  to retaliate. Here is a statement, formal statement issued by Iran's foreign minister, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=164.72s)]
*  Saeed Arghichie, says the following. Last week we were in negotiations with the U.S. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=171.52s)]
*  when Israel decided to blow up that diplomacy. This week we held talks with the E3 and EU [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=177.6s)]
*  when the U.S. decided to blow up that diplomacy. What conclusion would you draw to Britain and the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=184.72s)]
*  EU high rep? It is Iran which must, quote, return to the table, but how can Iran return to something [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=191.12s)]
*  it never left, let alone blew up? Here's what we're hearing from as well from Russia, Russia's former [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=197.84s)]
*  president and prime minister, Medvedev, put out the following statement. What did the Americans [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  achieve with their night strike on Three Points in Iran? Critical infrastructure of the nuclear [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=212.16s)]
*  cycle in Iran appears to have suffered little or no damage. Enrichment of nuclear materials, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=217.76s)]
*  and now we can say directly, and future production of nuclear weapons will continue. A number of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=224.56s)]
*  countries are ready to directly supply Iran with their nuclear weapons. Israel is under attack. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=230.8s)]
*  Explosions are thundering people in panic. The U.S. is now drawn into a new conflict with the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=237.84s)]
*  prospect of ground operations. That's coming from Russia's former president and prime minister, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=244.08s)]
*  Medvedev. Moments ago you had United States Vice President J.D. Vance. He was on the morning shows [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  and he was asked what's the difference between Donald Trump starting or being embroiled now [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=260.48s)]
*  in a war with Iran versus everything you, J.D. Vance, and Donald Trump had been saying before [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  that it's the stupidest thing in the world to do. It would take the dumbest person. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=273.6s)]
*  Only the stupidest negotiators would ever get into a war in Iran. This is part of the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=277.68s)]
*  neocon establishment. Here J.D. Vance this morning says, I empathize with Americans who are tired of [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=282.4s)]
*  25 years of foreign entanglements, but now we've got Donald Trump who's a genius and before we had [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=290.08s)]
*  stupid presidents. Now we have the greatest president, but then we had dumb presidents. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  That's the difference. He actually used those words basically. You can hear him for yourself. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=302.48s)]
*  I paraphrased a little bit, but he basically said that. Let's play that clip. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=307.68s)]
*  I think it's also important that we know some of the other geopolitical ramifications and things [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=337.68s)]
*  that are taking place. It's why the research tools that I use, I want to focus on what's left media [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  covering, what's right-wing media covering, what's center media covering, because even when stories [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=358.4s)]
*  like this are reported, the right-wing media never talks about it. A confidential brief [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=362.8s)]
*  to the ICC, International Criminal Courts, accuses Russia-linked Wagner of promoting atrocities in [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=367.76s)]
*  the West. How Russian media and right-wing media is interlinked with Russian media and right-wing [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=375.04s)]
*  media here in the United States as well. Here's a story that I think is being underreported, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=383.2s)]
*  how a lot of the top people in the United States military worked for Palantir, the AI company [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=389.6s)]
*  that's gaining access to all of your personal data and compiling a list of everybody in the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=396.0s)]
*  United States for Donald Trump. Meta and OpenAI, these corporations. Remember all those people [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=400.88s)]
*  sitting front row during the inauguration? A lot of the people who work there are now basically [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=407.76000000000005s)]
*  at top positions now in the military as well. This is the research tool that I use, because I [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=413.44s)]
*  get asked it all the time. I might as well tell you here. It's called Ground News. It's essential [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=418.48s)]
*  for me to see where the bias lies and try to correct for it. If you want to use the research [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=422.48s)]
*  tool that I use, go to ground.news.mtn or scan the QR code right there. We're going to give our [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=428.0s)]
*  viewers 40% off of Ground Nears top tier vantage plan. Use the tools I use. Again, it's also [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=434.24s)]
*  subscriber funded. They don't rely on ads that could introduce bias and subscribing [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=440.56s)]
*  supports our independent media network as well. Ground.news.mtn or scan the QR code and get that [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=444.88s)]
*  40% off. As I was noting before, that's what JD Vance was saying in this morning. Here's what [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=451.36s)]
*  Pete Hegseth had to say this morning as well. He held a press conference earlier and it was just [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=458.0s)]
*  basically praising Donald Trump for everything. Oh, this was the greatest. This was the greatest [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=464.48s)]
*  thing ever. Here's what Hegseth had to say. I want to give congratulations to our commander in chief. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=469.28s)]
*  It was an honor to watch him lead last night and throughout and to our great American warriors on [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=473.68s)]
*  this successful operation. God bless our troops. God bless America. And we give glory to God for [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=479.76s)]
*  his providence and continue to ask for his protection. Hegseth was then asked if there's [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  a possibility that Iran, North Korea, and other forces such as China are now going to join forces [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=495.6s)]
*  with Iran and retaliate. Does Iran, North Korea, China all join forces? Hegseth's responses to blame [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=502.56s)]
*  former president Biden. Play this clip. Iran and North Korea are cooperating on nuclear and missile [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  development. Do you think there is a possibility that Iran, North Korea, and the other forces [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=518.72s)]
*  such as China will join forces to retaliate against the United States? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=527.28s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, because of the policies under the previous administration, we drove those [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=536.4799999999999s)]
*  countries together and ultimately that creates a challenging environment. For this particular [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=541.04s)]
*  operation, the focus is on Iran and Iranian nuclear capabilities. That's our focus here, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=548.56s)]
*  is to not just say that they can't have, but President Trump has said from over 20 years, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=553.36s)]
*  frankly, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. And ultimately he decided this is the moment, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=558.32s)]
*  given their stonewalling, when direct military action had to be taken to prevent that from [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=563.6s)]
*  happening. Also during the press conference this morning, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=569.28s)]
*  was asked, do you believe that some nuclear ability remains? And he says that they don't [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=576.32s)]
*  have all that information yet. But as we now know, the Fordow facility does not seem to be [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=582.0s)]
*  fully destroyed, which is a big problem. And it seems that the United States government once again [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=587.76s)]
*  lied to us yesterday, the same way they've always, Trump has been lying to us. And when you had Tulsi [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=593.92s)]
*  Gabbard say 90 days ago that Iran was not capable of making a nuclear weapon. But anyway, here's [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=600.72s)]
*  what the reporter asks. Do you believe some nuclear ability in Iran remains? Here's what they say. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=605.36s)]
*  Me? Yeah. So is regime change off the table, Mr. Secretary? And to the chairman, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=610.88s)]
*  you said the battle damage assessment is still ongoing, but do you believe that some nuclear [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=618.64s)]
*  capability in Iran remains? This mission was not and has not been about regime change. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=623.68s)]
*  The president authorized a precision operation to neutralize the threats to our national interests [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=631.68s)]
*  posed by the Iranian nuclear program and the collective self-defense of our troops and our [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=638.64s)]
*  ally Israel. Thanks for your question. I think BDA is still pending and it would be way too early [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=645.36s)]
*  for me to comment on what may or may not still be there. But thanks for the question. Then you have [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=653.04s)]
*  J.D. Vance and Marco Rubio, Secretary of State Rubio and Vice President Vance. They were going [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=658.56s)]
*  on TV and they're pretending like we're not in a war with Iran right now. And again, just how [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=665.6s)]
*  weak and pathetic do they look? I mean, y'all took B-2 bombers and hit Iran's sites. You didn't [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=671.12s)]
*  destroy it. And now you want to pretend that we're not at war and then it's just a one and done and [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=678.72s)]
*  everything's okay, everybody. For real, this is what they were saying this morning. Here you have [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=684.32s)]
*  Kristen Welker asking J.D. Vance, is the United States now at war with Iran? And he says, no. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=688.72s)]
*  You may want to ask the Iranians what they think. Here, play this clip. Question, Mr. Vice President, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=694.64s)]
*  is the United States now at war with Iran? No, Kristen, we're not at war with Iran. We're at [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=699.3599999999999s)]
*  war with Iran's nuclear program. And let me just say, Kristen, that we're incredibly grateful and [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=707.1999999999999s)]
*  proud of the American Air Force pilots who did an incredible job last night. And then Maria [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=712.4799999999999s)]
*  Bartiroma on Fox asks Rubio and Rubio says, no. Again, you may want to ask Iran what they think [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=719.12s)]
*  about that. Play this clip. Now at war with Iran. No, we're not. This is not a war against Iran. This [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=725.6s)]
*  is very simple. You know, 67 days ago, the president of the United States sent the Iranians a [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=732.64s)]
*  letter and it said, you're not going to have nuclear weapons. You're not going to have a [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=737.92s)]
*  militarized nuclear program. Let's negotiate. I want to do this diplomatically. I want to do this [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=741.28s)]

*  president for the last 35 years. And, you know, the president told them, if we don't get a deal, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=750.0s)]
*  which is what he wanted, then I'll have to handle it differently. And that's what he did last night. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=755.2s)]
*  He handled it differently, but that was an Iranian choice. We didn't make that choice. They did. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=759.12s)]
*  By playing games with Donald Trump, they made a huge mistake. And President Trump acted last night. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=762.88s)]
*  And I think the world today is safer and more stable than it was 24 hours ago. And a bunch of [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=767.2800000000001s)]
*  these countries putting out statements, condemning us privately. They all agree with us that this [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=772.96s)]
*  needed to be done. They got to do what they got to do for, you know, their own public relations [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=777.36s)]
*  purposes. But the only people in the world that are unhappy about what happened in Iran last night [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=781.52s)]
*  is the regime in Iran. So what has Donald Trump been doing? Well, before the strikes took place, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=786.8000000000001s)]

*  great unity in the Republican Party, perhaps unity like we've never seen before. Now let's [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=825.12s)]
*  get the great big beautiful bill done. Our country is great. MAGA exclamation point. So he's like, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=831.12s)]
*  all right, we're done. Well, I've moved on. I moved on to the next topic. Sure, I've lit the whole [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=838.0s)]
*  Middle East on fire, joined a war, but let's talk about the disastrous budget bill that's going to [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=844.24s)]
*  take health care away from 15 million Americans now and give trillions of dollars in tax cuts to [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=850.08s)]
*  billionaires and screw over working class and hardworking people and take away food stamps and [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=855.28s)]
*  housing and attack women, reproductive rights and take away infrastructure jobs. Yeah, I've moved on. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=860.24s)]
*  I'm done. I'm done talking about it. And by the way, now as the threat of domestic terrorism, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=867.76s)]
*  of terrorism rather in the United States has increased significantly, of course, domestic [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=874.5600000000001s)]
*  terrorism, but terrorism from abroad inside the United States increases. This is the guy who's in [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=879.36s)]
*  charge of the counterterrorism at the Department of Homeland Security. And as Chris Murphy says, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=884.72s)]
*  as our nation girds for possible Iranian terrorist attacks, this is the person Trump has put to head [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=890.4s)]
*  the counterterrorism. 22 year old who was working in landscaping and he was a grocery clerk, but he [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=896.0s)]
*  was a big MAGA fan. So he got the job to be the 22 year old kid, got the job to be the top of the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=902.72s)]
*  head of counterterrorism with no prior experience. Oh, also JD Vance admitted when he was asked, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=909.5200000000001s)]
*  when did Trump make the decision to strike? JD Vance said no one really knew when we, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  no one had any clue. He just did it whenever. Play this clip. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=924.1600000000001s)]
*  Vice President, when did President Trump exactly make this decision and did he coordinate with [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=926.5600000000001s)]
*  Israel? The president, honestly, Kristen, I don't [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=933.36s)]
*  know that any of us knew exactly when the president made the decision except for the [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=939.2s)]
*  president himself. But if you back up a little bit, we engage in this diplomatic process. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=943.2s)]
*  I think that he decided probably by mid May that this process was not going anywhere. And so he [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=948.6400000000001s)]
*  decided to issue some private ultimatums to the Iranians. And then eventually, of course, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=955.36s)]
*  we decided to destroy the Fordo nuclear facility and some of these other facilities ourselves. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=959.84s)]
*  That's what we're learning this morning. We'll keep you posted, updated with more information [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpO_ReA18xE&t=965.36s)]
