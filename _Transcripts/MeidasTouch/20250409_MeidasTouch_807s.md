# Trump INFLICTS Carnage ON HIMSELF and CRASHES IT ALL
**MeidasTouch:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0)
*  Just take a look at this scene. Last night, the futures markets are crashing as Donald Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=0.0s)]
*  imposes 104% tariffs against China. China doesn't back down. Donald Trump is speaking at this [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=6.72s)]
*  Black Tie event for the National Republican Congressional Committee. Donald Trump looks [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  like he's on the Titanic that is sinking. He's got his little teeny tiny hands on the podium, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=24.319999999999997s)]
*  and Donald Trump speaks to the MAGA Republican Congress members and he says, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=32.16s)]
*  everybody, what are we going to call Joe Biden? Should we call him crooked or should we call him [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=37.92s)]
*  sleepy? Here, play this clip. Do I call him sleepy Joe or crooked Joe? Could we take a vote, please? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=44.08s)]
*  Who wants to call him crooked Joe? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=50.31999999999999s)]
*  Who wants to call him sleepy Joe? That's my problem. It's like the same. They both work. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=56.48s)]
*  They both work beautifully. As Donald Trump was doing that, we also learned from Usha Vance, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=64.88s)]
*  who gave her first interview, that her husband's world can be very lonely. The second lady gave [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=72.0s)]
*  her first interview since J.D. Vance assumed the role, and she described it all as very, very lonely. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=78.4s)]
*  Just let him hang out with the couch, Usha. Let him hang out with the couch. Sorry. Back to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=85.12s)]
*  Donald Trump here. Donald Trump speaking to the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=91.12s)]
*  He's like, aren't these tariffs great? All these countries have to kiss my ass. Here, play this clip. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=97.76s)]
*  And the history of our country. And don't let some of these politicians go around saying, you know, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=103.92s)]
*  because I'm telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my ass. They are dying [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=109.36s)]
*  to make a deal. Please, please, make a deal. I'll do anything. I'll do anything, sir. And then I'll [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=116.56s)]
*  see some rebel Republican, you know, some guy that wants to grandstand, say, I think the Congress [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=122.4s)]
*  should take over negotiations. Let me tell you, you don't negotiate like I negotiate. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=128.8s)]
*  As I've said before, Donald Trump's Liberation Day, as he calls it, which is actually Annihilation [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  Day, Liquidation Day, or Great Depression Day, it's all about his ego. It's all about the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=140.4s)]
*  authoritarian playbook to make countries have to go to him to beg him, please can I get an exemption? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  Please don't put the tariffs on me, makes businesses runt him. Please, I need help. I need [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=152.8s)]
*  an exemption. Can you please help me have to do the Walk of Shame to Washington, D.C. or Mar-a-Lago? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=157.92s)]
*  And authoritarians like when their people are suffering. Like, do you think Kim Jong-un is [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=163.2s)]
*  upset that people in North Korea suffer? Do you think Putin cares that he sends Russians into the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=168.56s)]
*  meat grinder of war in Ukraine? Do you think that he cares that people are suffering economically? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=172.88s)]
*  No. Authoritarians like when their people are suffering because then you can give breadcrumbs. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=178.16s)]
*  You don't want people to be economically independent or independent at all when you're [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=183.2s)]
*  an authoritarian and Trump is following that playbook to a T. I mean, just take a look right [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=188.16s)]
*  here as Karl Keane to NeonPost. We as the United States went from back to back under former President [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  Biden, 20 plus percent or 20 percent plus growth in the markets, equity markets, the Goldilocks [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  economy, the Wall Street Journal called the economy under former President Biden, the envy [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=206.48s)]
*  of the world to this. America's equity market, stock market is the worst in the world right now [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=211.52s)]
*  and tanking the entire world economy with it. As Donald Trump also says, you know, just trust me, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=218.8s)]
*  I'm telling you, I know what to do. I know how to do deals. I'm a good deal maker. Let's just take a [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  look at what's been going on. The Germany economy minister Robert Habek says the U.S. calculations [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=231.28s)]
*  for their tariffs are nonsense. The U.S. is now in a position of weakness, will hurt their [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=237.6s)]
*  pharmaceuticals. The EU commission proposed 25 percent counter tariffs on U.S. imports. Prime [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=242.72s)]
*  Minister Mark Carnegie of Canada announced that starting today there will be 25 percent tariffs on [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=250.32s)]
*  certain categories based on the Trump regime's behavior. The futures right now are getting [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=257.52s)]
*  absolutely bulldozed. We'll see where the market opens in just a little bit. But Trump tanking [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=264.96s)]
*  the economy and again yesterday went from the markets actually doing decent in the day or as [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=270.96s)]
*  Senator Mark Warner from Virginia put it, it was kind of like a good day at the hospice, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=279.76s)]
*  making that analogy to Trump's economy. But then Donald Trump said, no, I'm opposing [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=285.28s)]
*  104 percent tariffs on China. And then Trump crashed it all. And then at his speech last [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  night before the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner, Donald Trump then talked about [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=296.0s)]
*  how he wants to put tariffs on pharmaceuticals, that I'm going to go after the pharmaceuticals [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=301.76s)]
*  now. It's like, can we go one day without this idiot talking about tariffing things? Here he is. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=306.24s)]
*  Let's play it. But we're going to tariff our pharmaceuticals. And once we do that, they're [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=310.24s)]
*  going to come rushing back into our country because we're the big market. The advantage we [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=314.4s)]
*  have over everybody is that we're the big market. So we're going to be announcing very shortly [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=318.88s)]
*  a major tariff on pharmaceuticals. And when you and when they hear that, they will leave China, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  they will leave other places because they have to sell most of their product to salt here. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=332.48s)]
*  We did it, JD. We did it lonely JD. You see that graphic right there. Also, one of the things that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=337.28s)]
*  we learned is that Marjorie Taylor Greene buying lots of treasuries and making a lot of odd [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=343.44s)]
*  stock purchases and sales kind of right before the market started tanking and crashing. It doesn't [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=349.68s)]
*  really surprise me when it comes to Marjorie Taylor Greene. Right now, Apple's taking like [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=357.12s)]
*  emergency flights to try to put planes full of iPhones as they're going to be a run on iPhones [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=362.56s)]
*  right now. And Apple's getting crushed because of the tariffs Donald Trump put on Canada, I mean, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=368.16s)]
*  on China and China's retaliation. Also, one of the things that we learned yesterday is Donald Trump's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=374.56s)]
*  DHS, Department of Homeland Security, just ordered the migrants who were temporarily allowed to live [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=381.12s)]
*  in the US after using the Biden-era CBP-1 app that they're ordered to leave the country immediately. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  More than 900,000 people were allowed in the country using the CBP-1 app since January 2023. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  A lot of these people are family members of Trump supporters, Venezuelans for Trump, Cubans for [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=401.28s)]
*  Trump, Latinos for Trump. And now they're being threatened. Self-deport now or else you can end [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=406.4s)]
*  up in concentration camps in El Salvador. Self-deport now or you can end up in ICE detention [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  centers. No due process will throw you with Naid Bukele's authoritarian regime in El Salvador. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=420.16s)]
*  That's the message from the authoritarian Trump regime. But Donald Trump last night says, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=426.16s)]
*  this is the most successful 100 days yet of any administration in history. Here, play this clip. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  I had somebody say the most successful month, first month in the history. Now they said the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=437.76000000000005s)]
*  most successful 100 days in the history of our country. And I believe that's right. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=443.68s)]
*  And we're going to continue that way, if not more so. And we're going to do tremendously in midterms. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=449.68s)]
*  There's no- One of the things that I don't want to forget as I report on all of this as well is [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=454.88s)]
*  that federal spending has not gone down at all. In fact, federal spending right now, despite all [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=458.72s)]
*  the wrecking ball that Trump and Musk took to the federal government and the hostile takeover, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  federal spending is higher. Donald Trump wants there to be a $1 trillion military budget. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=472.24s)]
*  Of course, that's going to add to the debt. It's going to add to our growing deficit. Trump added [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=478.8s)]
*  $8 trillion to the deficit his first term. I predicted 25 to 30 trillion, perhaps more. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=484.48s)]
*  So government spending's not down, government spending's up. Let's not forget also that Elon [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=490.56s)]
*  Musk was just awarded basically a $6 billion contract for SpaceX by the federal government. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=495.68s)]
*  And this is on top of Elon Musk being awarded lots of money by the FAA as they got these [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=502.16s)]
*  agencies. Surprise, surprise, Elon Musk's companies are filling the void. Also, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=508.56s)]
*  Jeff Bezos got I think over $2 billion from the federal government as well. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=513.52s)]
*  Take a look at this headline from Bloomberg. Stagflation is now America's best case scenario. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=523.2s)]
*  Stagflation is crashing GDP and high inflation, that's stagflation. They're saying that this is [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=530.32s)]
*  the best case scenario. Trump's tariffs risk is a brutal combination of recession and inflation. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=539.44s)]
*  The president's attack on free trade is truly extraordinary in scope. The impact will be [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=547.12s)]
*  devastating over the next six months. Annualized inflation will likely climb to nearly 5% also [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=551.92s)]
*  lots of experts predicting about 2 million job losses over the coming months as the effects of [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  these tariffs start to kick in as well. I think one of the ways I visualize what's going on with [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=567.28s)]
*  these Trump tariffs right now, the fact that it's crashing the markets and the GDP is contracting so [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  soon, I think is shocking in the how fast this hit. But basically from an economist perspective, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=581.12s)]
*  you know how when a tsunami hits, the shore basically recedes, recedes, recedes, and [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=588.24s)]
*  most people who understand what that means would tell you, oh, a tsunami is coming. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=594.8s)]
*  That's what's happening right now. The damage is done. So now it's waiting for this economic tsunami, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=599.92s)]
*  stagflation, recession, great depression to swarm over the country right now. But as our [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=607.44s)]
*  editor in chief Ron Filipkowski says, okay, Trump's wrecking the economy, but at least we have RFK [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=613.44s)]
*  Jr. in charge of public health. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's team of lead [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=619.2s)]
*  poisoning experts remained off the job Tuesday, a week after they were first laid off by Health [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=624.72s)]
*  and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy in sweeping cuts to the nation's public health [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=630.96s)]
*  agencies. Cut to the CDC's branch responsible for investigating and preventing lead poisoning [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=635.84s)]
*  has brought multiple efforts to help local health authorities to a virtual standstill. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=642.24s)]
*  Current and laid off agency officials say including for lead poisoning responses that could have helped [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=648.16s)]
*  children in Milwaukee and on an American Indian reservation. So quite literally Americans are [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=653.44s)]
*  dying of lead poisoning because we've fired the workers who are in that field. And we're going to [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=659.76s)]
*  see this in all other aspects of government as well. Oh, and on international foreign policy, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=667.12s)]
*  many experts internationally say the US is now on course to potentially be at war with Iran coming [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=672.88s)]
*  soon based on the threats that Donald Trump has been making lately. What does Donald Trump and [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=679.76s)]
*  lonely JD Vance say? Are you happy yet? Are you happy? Say thank you. Say thank you. Say thank you. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzuBB4WKGW0&t=687.76s)]
