# Trump has DISASTER Presser as ELON QUITS
**MeidasTouch:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0)
*  Wow, Elon Musk and Donald Trump just held a disastrous press conference in the Oval Office. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=0.0s)]
*  The purported purpose of this press conference was that Elon's time working for the government [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=4.72s)]
*  would now officially come to an end, but Donald Trump stated during this press conference that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=10.32s)]
*  Elon is really not leaving. Also notable, Elon has a black eye, which was very noticeable during [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  this disastrous press conference. Listen to Trump say, Elon is not leaving during a press conference [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  where Elon claims to be leaving. Play this clip. So they're not leaving. And Elon's really not [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=27.92s)]
*  leaving. He's going to be back and forth, I think. I have a feeling. It's his baby and I think he's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=33.92s)]
*  going to be doing a lot of things. But Elon's service to America has been without comparison [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=39.36s)]
*  in modern history. He's already... So next, Elon is asked about his eye. Here's what he says. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=44.08s)]
*  Play this clip. I wanted to ask quickly, Mr. Musk, is your eye okay? What happened to your eye? I [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=48.56s)]
*  know this was a bruise thing. Well, it wasn't... I wasn't anywhere near France. So... [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=53.28s)]
*  But... What does that mean? I didn't notice it. First lady of France. I didn't notice it. So, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=59.6s)]
*  yeah, I was just horsing around with Lil X and I said, go ahead, punch me in the face. And he did. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=69.68s)]
*  Turns out even a five-year-old punching me in the face actually does... That was X that did? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=74.88s)]
*  X could do it. If you knew X, you could do it. I didn't really feel much at the time and then [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  I guess it bruises up. But I just watched him around with the kids. I didn't notice it actually. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=86.88s)]
*  Elon Musk spends his time during this press conference talking about the oval office being [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=92.8s)]
*  painted gold and how great it looks being painted gold. I've heard many people refer to it as the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=98.88s)]
*  Predators Bordello play this clip. By the way, isn't this incredible? This incredible... [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=104.8s)]
*  I mean, it's stunning, I think. The way that the office, the President has just completely [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  redone the oval office. It's beautiful. I love the gold on the ceiling. Thank you. It's pretty nice. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=118.64s)]
*  Yeah. That's been there a long time. That was plaster. Nobody ever really saw it. They didn't [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  know the eagle was up there. We highlighted it. Essentially, it's a landmark, a great landmark, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=129.44s)]
*  and that's 24 karat gold and everybody loved it. Now they all see it when they come in. So it's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=135.6s)]
*  been good. The oval office finally has the majesty that it deserves thanks to the President. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump then lies and claims that $8 million was being spent on transgender mice, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=148.0s)]
*  which has been debunked repeatedly. Play this clip. He's been able to find it. $8 million [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=154.48s)]
*  for making mice transgender. So they spent $8 million on making mice transgender. And those are [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=159.2s)]
*  better than many of theirs. I could sit here all day and read things just like that, but [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=167.76s)]
*  we have other things to do. So it's much... Elon Musk then says that he has a few more words that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  he wants to say. And then he says it's really not the end of Doge, but really the beginning. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=178.16s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=183.04s)]
*  Well, let me say perhaps a few words that this is not the end of Doge, but really the beginning. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=186.0s)]
*  My time as a special government employee necessarily had to end. It was a limited time [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=192.72s)]
*  thing. It's 134 days, I believe, which ends in a few days. So that comes with the time limit. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=196.48s)]
*  But the Doge team will only grow stronger over time. The Doge influence will only grow stronger. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  I liken it to sort of Buddhism. It's like a way of life. So it is permeating throughout the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=211.04s)]
*  government. And I'm confident that over time we'll see a trillion dollars of savings and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=217.04s)]
*  a trillion dollars of waste and poor production. The calculations of the Doge team thus far, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=224.0s)]
*  in terms of an FYI 20... Elon Musk is asked about the failure of Doge, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=230.72s)]
*  which claimed it was going to cut $2 trillion in government spending and make $2 trillion in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  government cuts. Actually, federal spending is significantly higher now under Donald Trump than [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=240.32s)]
*  it was in the same period under former President Biden. Also, based on Donald Trump's disastrous [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=245.44s)]
*  budget, the deficit is going to increase by trillions, making Doge the most unsuccessful [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  government program in American history. Here, play this clip. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=256.96s)]
*  Mr. Musk, on Doge, you said that there was a trillion dollar promise for cuts from Doge. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  Yes, I think we do expect over time to achieve the trillion dollars. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=264.96s)]
*  But what have you found in your time here was the biggest roadblock to getting those cuts? Was [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=268.16s)]
*  it the cabinet or was it Congress or something else? What was the biggest roadblock from your work? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  It's mostly just a lot of hard work. It's really not any one personal Congress. It's going through [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=279.36s)]
*  really millions of line items and saying, does each one of them make sense? Or does it not make [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=288.16s)]
*  sense? Obviously, at times when you cut expenses, those who are receiving the money, whether they [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=293.12s)]
*  are receiving that money legitimately or not, they do complain. You're not going to hear someone [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=298.48s)]
*  confessing that they received money inappropriately. Never. They're going to always say that they [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=304.08s)]
*  received money appropriately for an important cause, naturally. That's what you'd expect. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  But so we just have to, it's just a lot of work. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=314.24s)]
*  Donald Trump then says, as a result of the current condition, that he loves debt, basically, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=318.32s)]
*  we need to extend the debt. We need to extend it. More debt. Extend the debt. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=323.84s)]
*  Listen to him in his own words. Play this clip. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=328.56s)]
*  I don't hold anything against him for that. But that was put on our plate when it should have [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=353.84s)]
*  been on the Democrats. September 28th, a famous date. It should have been taken care of by the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  Democrats. But this person, a man of power, gave it to us so that in June that comes due. Well, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=374.08s)]
*  we have to take care of that because Elon Musk is asked about Donald Trump. They're both asked [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=382.4s)]
*  about a report about Elon Musk being addicted to ketamine and mushrooms and taking cocktails of [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=387.52s)]
*  drugs while he was running Doge and running our country into the ground. And then Elon Musk goes, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=394.32s)]
*  Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. Your play this clip. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=400.08s)]
*  Thank you, President Trump. The president mentioned that you had to deal with all the slings and [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=403.44s)]
*  arrows during your time at Doge. There's this. Some of the people, some of the media repocasations [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=407.12s)]
*  the slingers. Well, so there is a New York Times report today that accuses you of luring the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=412.88s)]
*  line between. Is the New York Times, is that the same publication that got a Pulitzer Prize [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=419.2s)]
*  for false reporting on the Russiagate? Is it the same organization? I gotta check my Pulitzer [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=426.48s)]
*  calendar. It is. So I think the judge just ruled against New York Times for their lies about the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  Russiagate hoax and that they might have to give back that Pulitzer Prize. That New York Times. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=440.72s)]
*  Let's move on. Okay. I got one for President Trump. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=446.0s)]
*  Next up, Donald Trump and Elon Musk are asked if the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump are going to [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=452.88000000000005s)]
*  hurt companies like Tesla. And then Donald Trump idiotically responds, no, because everything's [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  going to be manufactured in America, all the parts, everything. So it's all going to be great. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=465.20000000000005s)]
*  That's not going to happen. And we know that Donald Trump is a taco. Trump always chickens out. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=470.0s)]
*  Play this clip. I'm concerned that tariffs may also affect companies like Tesla, which has parts [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=475.12s)]
*  manufactured abroad. And this is also to use to mask. Well, he's going to end up building this [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=480.8s)]
*  whole car here. I mean, I thought he built his whole car. Pretty much he does. He's got incredible [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=485.92s)]
*  factories. And like I looked at one in Texas, it's unbelievable. I know all of the manufacturers [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=490.4s)]
*  who build their parts here, too. I mean, I used to bother me. They make a part in Canada, part in [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=497.6s)]
*  Mexico, a part in Europe and sent all over the place and nobody knew what the hell was happening. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=504.24s)]
*  I think it's ridiculous. You build a car, make it in America. And I gave them a little leeway on [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=508.8s)]
*  that. You know, gave them some leeway. But over the next year, they've got to have the whole thing [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=514.4s)]
*  built in America. That's what we want. We want America to buy American built cars. Thank you very much. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=519.0400000000001s)]
*  Thank you guys. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=528.08s)]
*  How was your monitor? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=528.64s)]
*  Are you considering? Thanks guys. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Thank you. Thanks guys. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=533.52s)]
*  Let's go straight out here. Thanks guys. When was the last time that you truly trusted seafood you [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=538.16s)]
*  brought home? Now I used to question everything from nutrition and taste to sustainability [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=544.16s)]
*  until I discovered the Wild Alaskan Company. Wild Alaskan Company is the best way to get [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=548.96s)]
*  wild caught perfectly portioned nutrient dense seafood delivered directly to your door. Trust me, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=554.32s)]

*  Wild Alaskan Company. Now I received my Pacific halibut and pan seared it that evening. It was [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=564.8000000000001s)]
*  delicious. The Wild Alaskan Company is 100% wild caught, never farmed. This means there are no [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=570.32s)]

*  communities. It's nutrient rich and full of flavor. Wild Alaskan fish is frozen off the boat [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=582.8s)]
*  to lock in taste, texture and nutrients like omega-3s. My favorite, it's also sustainably [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=588.64s)]

*  tariffs our nation would be imperiled. Play this clip. Tariffs are so important and that's why we [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=637.04s)]
*  were so happy with the decision yesterday where the tariffs continue because without the tariffs [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=642.48s)]
*  our nation would be imperiled. We would really be imperiled. I think I can say that with great [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=649.52s)]
*  charity, Scott and Howard. And so we were very happy to get that decision, that big decision [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=653.8399999999999s)]
*  yesterday. All right, then if that's true, then why did you withdraw your tariffs against the world? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  If you think they're so great, if you think they're so great, then why did you withdraw [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=665.28s)]
*  145% tariffs on China and make them 30%? Tariffs are a absolute disaster. They cause a great deal [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=669.12s)]
*  of harm and Trump always chickens out. Next, Donald Trump with Elon standing next to him [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=676.48s)]
*  plays news clips on a laptop. Play this clip. People who I've respected over the years from, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=683.1999999999999s)]
*  you know, Joe Kiernan and Rick Santelli, this just came out and we'll just play that for a second. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=690.24s)]
*  Personal income is up eight tenths of a percent. That is almost triple the expectations. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=696.24s)]
*  You know, watching this, I don't know, I mean to take this seriously. Like if you have [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=706.24s)]
*  an elderly person in your life who may suffer from dementia or someone when they would be like, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=710.5600000000001s)]
*  come here, Ben, I want to show you a video. I want to show you a video. I'm going to debunk [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=715.3599999999999s)]
*  that video in just a moment because actually the job, the income increase is actually caused by [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=719.52s)]
*  retroactive social security benefits caused by former president Biden. But we'll get into that [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=726.7199999999999s)]
*  in a moment. Donald Trump then says, Elon's service has been the greatest thing in America. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=732.64s)]
*  Play this clip. Many of the Doge people, Elon, are staying behind too, so they're not leaving. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=737.8399999999999s)]
*  And Elon's really not leaving. He's going to be back and forth. I think I have a feeling [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=744.16s)]
*  it's his baby and I think he's going to be doing a lot of things. But Elon's service to America [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=748.8000000000001s)]
*  has been without comparison in modern history. More of Donald Trump attacking Harvard University [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=753.6800000000001s)]
*  and saying he wants to take Harvard's money and put it into trade schools or Donald, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=759.28s)]
*  you can do what former president Biden did, which was invest in trade schools and invest in research [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=763.52s)]
*  institutes. It's not a zero sum game that you have to destroy America's top universities. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=768.64s)]
*  And also you're not helping trade schools either. You're actually destroying them and running them [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=773.52s)]
*  into the ground to play this clip. Every three days we find another hundred million dollars that [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=777.04s)]
*  was given. Last two days ago we found 200 million dollars more. The money's given to them like gravy. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=782.48s)]
*  I'd like to see the money go to trade schools where people learn how to fix motors and engines, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=788.24s)]
*  where people learn how to build rocket ships because you know somebody has to build those [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=793.6s)]
*  rocket ships. And I'd like to see trade schools set up because you could take five billion plus [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=797.52s)]
*  hundreds of billions more, which is what's spent. And you could have the greatest trade school system [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=803.28s)]
*  anywhere in the world. And that's all we need to build his rockets and robots and things that he's [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=809.12s)]
*  Elon Musk whining about judges, play the clip. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=813.68s)]
*  I think the fundamental moral flaw of the left is empathy for the criminals and not empathy for the [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=820.16s)]
*  victims. Empathy for the criminals but not empathy for the victims. And there's been way too much of [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=826.32s)]
*  that. That needs to stop. To the president's point there's been immense judicial overreach [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=833.2800000000001s)]
*  that is unconstitutional. That was never intended. And it's undermining the people's faith in the [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=838.8000000000001s)]
*  legal system. It needs to stop. It's gone too far. Mr. Musk. Donald Trump then gives Elon Musk this [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=845.0400000000001s)]
*  weird key here. You can see this play this clip. A little special something we have here. Thank you. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=852.4s)]
*  A very special that I give to very special people. I have given it to some, but it goes to very special [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=857.68s)]
*  people. And I thought I'd give it to Elon as a presentation from our country. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=865.92s)]
*  Take care. Thank you. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=873.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=874.32s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=878.48s)]
*  I love that this is amazing. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=880.72s)]
*  Well let me say perhaps a few words. All right let's talk about Elon's black eye for a second. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=885.2s)]
*  I don't know if it's related to this, but the Daily Mail was reporting that Elon Musk and Treasury [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=890.96s)]
*  Secretary Scott Bessent got into a physical altercation recently. And Caroline Levitt from [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=896.88s)]
*  the White House did not deny that a physical alteration took place. Apparently Treasury [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=904.08s)]
*  Secretary Scott Bessent confronted Elon Musk about not making any cuts and actually adding debt. And [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=910.16s)]
*  then apparently Elon Musk pushed him and a fight broke out. So I'm not sure if that's what caused [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=918.08s)]
*  the black eye. I hear many people are calling it a D-E black eye. I guess it was something like that. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=923.28s)]
*  Also Elon Musk took Stephen Miller's wife to work with him. As Raw Story reports, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=931.6s)]
*  rumors swirl as Stephen Miller's wife leaves the White House to work for Elon Musk. Hard to surprise [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=942.0799999999999s)]
*  me anymore, but a somewhat credible rumor of a thruple between Stephen Miller, his wife, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=948.4s)]
*  and Elon Musk has really thrown me for a loop. We're seeing memes like this. Stephen Miller [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=955.12s)]
*  watching his wife go to work for Elon. The cut chair rumors swirl as Stephen Miller's wife leaves [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=960.0799999999999s)]
*  the White House to work for Elon Musk. Rick Wilson posted that. Even the Democrat account posted a [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=965.68s)]
*  photo of a cut chair. I'm apparently learning what that, I wasn't sure what that meant, but okay, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=970.4s)]
*  that's a cut chair. And Donald Trump is then asked about is Putin a good guy or a bad guy here, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=976.32s)]
*  play this clip. Do you look at this and see Putin as the good guy or the bad guy? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=982.32s)]
*  So I've known him very well. And I went through a lot of things with him because Russia was, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=987.44s)]
*  you know, the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax turned out to be a total hoax. New York Times, they got [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=994.96s)]
*  a Pulitzer Prize. They have to get back to Pulitzer Prize. That's my lawsuit. And they're doing very [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=1000.4000000000001s)]
*  poorly in that lawsuit. But, you know, they wrote stories about how it was true and it was false. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=1004.96s)]
*  And, you know, a lot of Washington Post also. I have gotten to see things that I was very surprised [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=1009.6800000000001s)]
*  that rockets being shot into cities like Kiev during a negotiation that I felt was maybe very [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=1018.24s)]
*  close to ending. We were going to solve a problem. And then all of a sudden rockets got shot into [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=1028.08s)]
*  a couple of cities and people died. I saw things that I was surprised at. So and I don't like being [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=1034.24s)]
*  surprised. So I'm very disappointed in that way. With that being said, I'd like to see then 5000 [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=1041.8400000000001s)]
*  people, I think the numbers that even more than that, but 5000 people a week are being killed, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=1048.3200000000002s)]
*  mostly soldiers, but also people that live in little cities and towns throughout Ukraine. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaBDrbsWlJ0&t=1054.56s)]
