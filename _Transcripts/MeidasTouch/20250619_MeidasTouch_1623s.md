# WHOA! Carroll STRIKES BACK at Trump with ALL HIS SECRETS
**MeidasTouch:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E)
*  I'm joined by E. Jean Carroll and her incredible lawyer, Robbie Kaplan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=0.0s)]
*  E. Jean Carroll is breaking her silence. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=4.8s)]
*  She took Donald Trump on in federal court, prevailing twice. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=7.96s)]
*  Donald Trump threw everything he could at E. Jean Carroll and her legal team, led by [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=13.0s)]
*  Robbie Kaplan. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=18.48s)]
*  In fact, he's still doing that, trying to invoke the Westfall Act once again to substitute [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=19.48s)]
*  the United States government in the case where E. Jean Carroll prevailed in a defamation matter [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=27.479999999999997s)]
*  against Donald Trump, getting a large verdict there. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=33.48s)]
*  We'll talk about that with Robbie Kaplan as well. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  But E. Jean, breaking your silence here on the Midas Touch Network, you're out with this [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=39.36s)]
*  new book, Not My Type. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=43.2s)]
*  Tell us, how do you feel, what's going on? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=46.84s)]
*  What's your reaction just to everything that's happening right now? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=50.28s)]
*  Well, Ben, you asked how I felt five years ago when you have five followers. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=53.08s)]
*  Now you've got 50 or what? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  Five, six million followers. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=62.6s)]
*  And I am still fabulous, but even more fabulous now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=64.88s)]
*  Thank you, Ben. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=70.28s)]
*  Well, tell us, you know, E. Jean, you've seen what Donald Trump has now done back in power. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=71.28s)]
*  We've seen how he's used the legal system to try to bulldoze over people's rights. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=78.55999999999999s)]
*  And he tried everything against you with all of his money, with all of his resources, with [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=84.63999999999999s)]
*  all of his minions, reflecting on this moment about what you went through, E. Jean. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  What's your message to the American people right now? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, the headline in Newsweek about 20 minutes ago about the book was Comedy Gold. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=99.28s)]
*  And what this what we're what Robbie and I have always done and what this book does [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=107.64s)]
*  is we approach things in a light way, because we understand this is a man who wears apricot [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=112.16s)]
*  makeup with his hair twirled around his head like Barbara Stanwyck in Ball of Fire, who [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=122.84s)]
*  we can beat. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=133.2s)]
*  We figured that out five years ago, laid out our plan, and we we stayed very serious. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=136.52s)]
*  This was a serious, dead serious trial. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=143.68s)]
*  And the second trial was dead serious. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=148.22s)]
*  But we kept it light. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=152.12s)]
*  It was I I was amazed. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=154.44s)]
*  I found myself in the middle of a high comedy, surrounded with characters. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  Then you are a litigator. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=164.68s)]
*  You can't even imagine John Grisham himself could not have come up with characters like [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  Alina Habba, Judge Lewis Kaplan, Joe Takapina, Robbie Kaplan. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=174.8s)]
*  It was Joe Takapina alone, shaped like Popeye, got a voice like a shotgun in a gravel pit. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=181.3s)]
*  Alina Habba. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  Sometimes her hair is long. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=192.92s)]
*  Sometimes it's short. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=195.24s)]
*  Sometimes she's arrogant. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  Sometimes she's nice. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=198.85999999999999s)]
*  Sometimes she's loud. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=200.72s)]
*  Sometimes she's flirtatious. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=202.7s)]
*  She was amazing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=204.48s)]
*  So I was enthralled. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=206.0s)]
*  And as an old journalist, I was taking notes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=209.6s)]
*  And I want people to know that one little short, five foot two inch woman about the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=216.1s)]
*  size of an Olsen twin and one old lady, 81 years old, took on Donald Trump. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=223.34s)]
*  And we won. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=231.29999999999998s)]
*  Twice. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  Robbie Kaplan, going to you, the strategy that you had. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean, yes, we know the trials. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=239.54s)]
*  We were covering them here on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=242.82s)]
*  But as a former litigator, the trial is in many ways what you look forward to. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=245.5s)]
*  But all the work that goes into the trial, the depositions that were taking place, all [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=252.10000000000002s)]
*  of Donald Trump's procedural maneuvers, the delay tactics that were used, how he wouldn't [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=258.02000000000004s)]
*  participate in discovery. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=264.54s)]
*  And then he would try to play the victim and say, oh, now I want to do this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=266.66s)]
*  So you saw it from a legal perspective. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=270.98s)]
*  Obviously, I'm asking you to give your legal secrets. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  But like what observations do you have generally? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=276.82s)]
*  And how could that be applied, Robbie, to the current moment that we're in? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=280.06s)]
*  So first, let me say that to the extent anyone was funny in this case, it was E. Jean. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=285.02s)]
*  I play the straight man, I think, pretty much throughout the trial and throughout her book. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=289.38s)]
*  So I take no credit for being funny at all. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=293.56s)]
*  But the circumstances we were in were both tragic in one way, exhilarating in one way, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=297.38s)]
*  and incredibly probably funny throughout. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=303.54s)]
*  And I think the one lesson that could be learned from how we litigated this, both E. Jean and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=306.26000000000005s)]
*  my team and myself, is stay the course. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=312.98s)]
*  It took a long time. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=317.62s)]
*  We're still not done. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=319.54s)]
*  It's taken a very long time to get to where we are. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=320.82000000000005s)]
*  It took stubbornness on our part. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=324.58000000000004s)]
*  When my son just graduated high school, but when he was a little boy, I used to read him [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=327.38s)]
*  this book called Dog Needs a Bone. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=332.90000000000003s)]
*  And in this case was our bone. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=336.18s)]
*  And we grabbed it in our in our mouths and we held on to it the whole time. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=338.82s)]
*  And I think the ultimate lesson is that the courts have and are continuing to hold up [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=344.1s)]
*  pretty well. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=349.14s)]
*  We've gotten good rulings, obviously, from the district court. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=350.74s)]
*  We've gotten a bunch of good rulings from the circuit court. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=353.70000000000005s)]
*  There's another argument on Tuesday. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=356.62s)]
*  Juries are good things. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=359.66s)]
*  I think the reason we won this trial is because we had juries with rules of evidence following [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=362.18s)]
*  the truth rather than people watching things on YouTube or QAnon or God knows what and [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=366.74s)]
*  watching conspiracy theories. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=372.1s)]
*  And in that system, people get to the truth and they got to the truth here. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=374.18s)]
*  The ultimate thing is we got to get her money, which I have not yet accomplished. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=378.18s)]
*  Well, let's talk about that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=382.02s)]
*  The show me the money, get her the money. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=383.38s)]
*  Let's talk about where we're at now. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=385.18s)]
*  We covered here the Second Circuit's unbanked ruling on the first case, sexual assault, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=387.14s)]
*  five million dollars. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=396.3s)]
*  The unbanked panel upheld what the three judge panel did and what the district court did. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=397.86s)]
*  Donald Trump arguably has the ability to bring that to the Supreme Court. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=403.7s)]
*  We'll see what he does there separately. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=407.02s)]
*  He has said he intends to do that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=408.9s)]
*  So then separately, we have the defamation case, which was the other trial. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=412.1s)]
*  Remind us the amount of that verdict and then what Donald Trump is doing, because there's [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=417.22s)]
*  updates as recent as Wednesday of what Trump is doing by trying to once again bring the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=421.86s)]
*  United States government in as a party to try to get rid of this case. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=429.06s)]
*  What's happening there? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=433.92s)]
*  So the the verdict that you're talking about now, Ben, is called the big kahuna. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=435.38s)]
*  So just a little bit bigger than the five million dollar verdict. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=440.09999999999997s)]
*  It's eighty three point six million dollars, which today with interest is about eighty [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=442.97999999999996s)]
*  eight million dollars. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=447.58s)]
*  There is to be an argument next Tuesday before the Second Circuit arguing the merits of that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=449.82s)]
*  case. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=455.74s)]
*  They don't really have that much to argue because most of the facts development happened [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=456.74s)]
*  at the first trial. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=461.38s)]
*  Judge Kaplan knows what he was doing. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=462.38s)]
*  But even then, obviously, Trump's motive has been to delay, to delay, to delay. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=465.06s)]
*  The latest maneuver is to substitute again, try to substitute again the United States [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=470.78000000000003s)]
*  of America into the case as a defendant rather than Donald Trump. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=476.18s)]
*  This is probably the third time they've tried that. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=480.7s)]
*  We wrote motion papers saying you're too late, too little. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=484.54s)]
*  Forget about it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=487.62s)]
*  And just today, the Second Circuit panel, who will hear the argument on Tuesday, denied [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=489.1s)]
*  that motion. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=493.54s)]
*  So we're going forward on Tuesday morning. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=494.86s)]
*  Back to you, E. Jean. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=497.86s)]
*  So Donald Trump has said a number of things about you after these trials and the statements [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=499.46000000000004s)]
*  look a lot like the statements that you filed lawsuits and prevailed on. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=506.3s)]
*  After you won the initial verdict, Donald Trump did a town hall on CNN and immediately [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=512.78s)]
*  started making comments about you in front of millions of people. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=519.0600000000001s)]
*  Now we saw that that worked its way into amended versions of complaints and it was [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=524.78s)]
*  used but not as a separate overall case. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=529.54s)]
*  Let me just remind our viewers what he did and what CNN platformed the moment after he [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=533.22s)]
*  was found liable for sexual assault. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=538.48s)]
*  And this was in May of 2023. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=540.9399999999999s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=543.66s)]
*  Usually you leave office, you say, I'm sorry, but I'm going to back home. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=544.66s)]
*  I'm back home to my family and everything. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=548.26s)]
*  I'm going to be resigned. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=550.06s)]
*  My poll numbers went up and they went up with the other fake charge too because what's happening [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=551.3s)]
*  is they're doing this for election interference. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=555.5799999999999s)]
*  This woman, I don't know her. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=559.06s)]
*  I never met her. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=560.78s)]
*  I have no idea who she is. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=562.02s)]
*  I had a picture taken years ago with her and her husband, nice guy, John Johnson. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=563.8199999999999s)]
*  He was a newscaster, very nice man. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=567.8599999999999s)]
*  She called him an ape, happens to be African-American, called him an ape. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=570.92s)]
*  The judge wouldn't allow us to put that in. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=575.0799999999999s)]
*  Her dog or her cat was named Vagina. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=577.78s)]
*  The judge wouldn't allow it to put that in. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=581.66s)]
*  All of these things. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=583.6999999999999s)]
*  But with her, they can put in anything. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=585.18s)]
*  Access Hollywood put in anything. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=587.0999999999999s)]
*  This is a jury of nine people who found you liable of sexual abuse. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=588.0999999999999s)]
*  Do you think that that will deter women from voting for you? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=592.6999999999999s)]
*  No, I don't think so because I think the whole thing, just so you understand, ready? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=595.86s)]
*  I never met this woman. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=601.06s)]
*  I never saw this woman. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=603.8199999999999s)]
*  I met her at the front door of Bergdorf Goodman, which I rarely go into other than for a couple [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=606.34s)]
*  of charities. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=611.0200000000001s)]
*  I met her in the front door. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=612.46s)]
*  She was about 60 years old. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=614.46s)]
*  This is like 22, 23 years ago. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=616.0200000000001s)]
*  I met her in the front door. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=618.46s)]
*  We get the point. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=620.74s)]
*  He didn't just do that there. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=622.1s)]
*  I could show you, and I don't need to show you, but he's said that on multiple other [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=623.7800000000001s)]
*  occasions where he's held press conferences and he's done that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=627.94s)]
*  What was your response to seeing that, though, on CNN after this important victory on a very, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=635.58s)]
*  very serious issue? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=642.62s)]
*  He does that. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=644.32s)]
*  And then more, what a lot of people want to know is, are you considering filing another [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=645.32s)]
*  lawsuit against him based on his other defamatory remarks? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=650.1s)]
*  Well, Robbie always said all options on the table. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=653.9000000000001s)]
*  But if you watch that CNN thing, he is making the crowd laugh about sexual assault. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=660.1s)]
*  And then he tries to make himself look like he's the one who's suffering. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=667.62s)]
*  During the second trial, the $83.3 million one, he would go out and have press conferences [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=673.3000000000001s)]
*  with his American flags lined down Trump Tower. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=680.98s)]
*  And he would say, quote, I'm the one who's suffering. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=686.66s)]
*  I'm the one who should have the damages. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=691.78s)]
*  And he would stand there like Saint Sebastian tied to the tree being shot with arrows. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=695.98s)]
*  It was it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=703.98s)]
*  It's shaking me a little bit to re see it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=709.1800000000001s)]
*  I haven't seen it for a while. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=712.1s)]
*  And the thing is, people believe him. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=714.34s)]
*  He's president of the United States. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=717.66s)]
*  He is one of the most powerful people on earth. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=719.0600000000001s)]
*  Whenever they hear the president of the United States saying those terrible things, it shakes [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=722.3000000000001s)]
*  me. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=729.58s)]
*  It also makes me stronger. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=731.0200000000001s)]
*  It's not a word of what he says is true, not a word. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=733.26s)]
*  So that just gives Robbie and me more iron in our backbones. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=736.62s)]
*  And we go ahead. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=741.7800000000001s)]
*  I just have to add one thing, Ben, because I can't help myself as a litigator. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=742.7800000000001s)]
*  Remember on that clip, he just said he rarely went to Bergdorf's? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=748.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there was certain evidence that Judge Kaplan didn't let us get in before the jury. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=751.86s)]
*  And one of those pieces of evidence was a book that Donald Trump wrote with his name [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=756.98s)]
*  on it that recommends that Bergdorf is one of his favorite places to go to buy gifts. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=761.4200000000001s)]
*  I love that. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=767.34s)]
*  You know, in a Robbie, when I was showing that clip, I asked my editor to cut it short [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=768.98s)]
*  because I actually saw that it was causing Eugene Payne and I had other clips I want [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=774.94s)]
*  to show and I'm not going to show it because I saw it impacting her. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=780.1800000000001s)]
*  So I don't know if the audience saw I said cut the clip. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=784.22s)]
*  So there's clearly there's clear this is clearly damaging to her. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=787.02s)]
*  I'm not I don't still practice law, but I know but I play one on YouTube and I play [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=792.86s)]
*  one on TV. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=798.22s)]
*  But I still make sure I follow it and I teach law class over at USC. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=799.22s)]
*  So to me, when I hear Donald Trump saying that I'm just giving my opinion, it looks [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=804.9200000000001s)]
*  elements are met for another defamation case if one were to be brought. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=809.58s)]
*  It looks like based on Judge Kaplan's prior rulings, there's what's called race judicata [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=815.62s)]
*  where a lot of the rulings are already made with these statements. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=821.66s)]
*  So it seems that if a case were to be brought, it would just once again be about damages. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=825.64s)]
*  And if I'm understanding Eugene with all options on the table, and I don't want to put words [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=831.86s)]
*  into your mouth, do you believe that there is a case for defamation to be made? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=837.52s)]
*  And at this point, it's just a decision. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=842.92s)]
*  Honestly, if he wants to go through that whole situation again, because going through a litigation [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=844.92s)]
*  like that is is a grueling process for anyone. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=849.72s)]
*  I agree completely with your legal analysis, Ben. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=853.56s)]
*  All options are on the table and he's damages, unfortunately, and sadly continue because [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=856.16s)]
*  she continues to get absolutely horrific threats and emails and texts every time every time [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=861.84s)]
*  she opens her telephone. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=869.2s)]
*  What was it like deposing Donald Trump? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=870.2s)]
*  I'll show our viewers what just a brief portion of of it and your incredible cross exam. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=875.2800000000001s)]
*  But I want to know being in that room with him taking a deposition. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=883.0s)]
*  You know, I remember I took some high profile depositions in my time. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=888.04s)]
*  I took a Supreme Court Justice of California's deposition in a case. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=892.12s)]
*  I deposed a few owners of NFL teams in the Colin Kaepernick case. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=897.28s)]
*  But you know, so having deposition of billionaires is one thing. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=902.56s)]
*  But then having a billionaire who's a former president of the United States now current. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=907.12s)]
*  Let me just show the viewers and then may I say something before you show the clip? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=912.56s)]
*  Robbie Kaplan told Donald Trump three times, three times that she was going to show him [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=917.36s)]
*  a picture of E. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=925.8000000000001s)]
*  Jean Carroll. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=927.08s)]
*  She prepared him to see a picture of E. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=928.6800000000001s)]
*  Jean Carroll three times. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=932.88s)]
*  And now look what happened. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=935.32s)]
*  And then after seeing this, Donald Trump that said something about you, which I don't think [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=937.4s)]
*  didn't fully register until afterwards that he called you a very horrific thing. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=942.0799999999999s)]
*  And he and he did it in his own way. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=947.76s)]
*  Anyway, let me show you the clip and then we'll go from there. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=949.24s)]
*  I think so, yes. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=952.16s)]
*  And do you recall when you first saw this photo? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=953.5999999999999s)]
*  At some point during the process, I saw that's I guess her husband, John Johnson, who was an anchor. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=956.52s)]
*  For ABC, nice guy. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=967.8399999999999s)]
*  I thought I mean, I don't know him, but I thought he was pretty good at what he did. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=969.92s)]
*  I don't even know who the woman let's say I don't know who it's Marla. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=975.52s)]
*  You're saying Marla's in this photo? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=983.4s)]
*  That's Marla. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=985.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's my wife. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=986.04s)]
*  Which one are you pointing to? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=987.68s)]
*  Here. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=989.68s)]
*  The person you just pointed to was E. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=992.08s)]
*  Jean Carroll. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=993.36s)]
*  Who is that? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=993.84s)]
*  Who is this? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=994.44s)]
*  And the person the woman on the right is your then wife. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=996.8s)]
*  I don't know. This was the picture. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=999.64s)]
*  I assume that's John Johnson. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1001.24s)]
*  Is that Carol? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1002.88s)]
*  Because it's very blurry. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1004.16s)]
*  Now in your June. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1005.92s)]
*  Kind of here, Alina Habba directing. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1008.16s)]
*  So walk us through that moment, but more broadly, the depositions of Trump. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1010.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, E. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1015.08s)]
*  Jean kind of set the stage. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1015.8s)]
*  I was not trying to pull a fast one on Donald Trump there. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1017.0s)]
*  And I was very clear. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1019.96s)]
*  He mentioned the photo on set. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1021.4399999999999s)]
*  Let me show you the photo. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1022.84s)]
*  And when he identified E. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1024.6399999999999s)]
*  Jean as Marla. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1025.96s)]
*  I had a hard time kind of not jumping out of my seat. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1027.72s)]
*  I was so happy about it. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1030.04s)]
*  But then you can immediately see Habba trying to coach him, which he does, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1032.5600000000002s)]
*  which I think looks terrible to a juror. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1036.1200000000001s)]
*  And then the best part is it's classic Donald Trump, because once he realizes [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1039.0800000000002s)]
*  he's wrong, what does he say? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1043.04s)]
*  It's blurry. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1045.04s)]
*  That photo is blurry. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1046.64s)]
*  And the jury saw that photo and they knew it wasn't blurry. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1048.0800000000002s)]
*  And that's why we won both of our trials. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1051.0800000000002s)]
*  Talk about what you learned from your book, Tyler, E. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1053.6s)]
*  Jean, to that deposition. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1055.48s)]
*  Yeah, not my type. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1057.0s)]
*  Not my type. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1058.6799999999998s)]
*  One of the questions during the deposition, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1060.04s)]
*  when Donald Trump was trying to say why it was that he didn't sexually [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1062.6399999999999s)]
*  assault you, he was saying was because she's not my type. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1066.6s)]
*  When did you see that, E. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1072.32s)]
*  Jean? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1073.36s)]
*  And were you in the room when the deposition took place? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1073.76s)]
*  Did you watch the video after? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1076.84s)]
*  How did you see it? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1078.1599999999999s)]
*  I heard about it afterwards. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1079.96s)]
*  I wanted to sit next to Robbie during the deposition. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1082.92s)]
*  She ruled against it. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1085.88s)]
*  I heard afterwards. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1089.6000000000001s)]
*  They heard afterwards about it. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1092.4s)]
*  And it's odd that the phrase not my type used to be a polite thing [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1094.44s)]
*  of both men and women, which you would say when you're not attracted to someone. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1101.48s)]
*  Not my type. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1105.1200000000001s)]
*  And everybody accepted it as a polite thing. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1105.76s)]
*  But when Donald Trump said it, because he was famous for denigrating [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1107.96s)]
*  women, remember when he called Miss Universe, Miss Piggy? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1112.88s)]
*  So he said it. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1117.2s)]
*  The entire universe of women changed. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1118.7600000000002s)]
*  And Robbie not only told him he was going to see a photo of me three times, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1122.8400000000001s)]
*  she then said, are your wives your type? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1129.5600000000002s)]
*  Would you say Marla is Marla Mayfield's your type? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1134.0800000000002s)]
*  Ivana is your type? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1137.1200000000001s)]
*  She went through to see what was his type. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1138.16s)]
*  And then he falls. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1140.96s)]
*  By the way, Robbie said that as a trap. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1142.68s)]
*  She's all not going to admit it. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1144.8400000000001s)]
*  But she set trap after trap. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1146.48s)]
*  And like Odysseus getting away from the monsters. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1149.96s)]
*  It was unbelievable what she did. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1154.92s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure Robbie will say also the ultimate trap as litigators. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1159.3600000000001s)]
*  The truth is you walk someone right into the direction of the truth. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1163.8s)]
*  And someone who lies can't keep all of their lies together. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1168.3600000000001s)]
*  And so inevitably, they fall right into the most basic thing [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1172.72s)]
*  when you're just going through it. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1176.4s)]
*  Robbie, what was it like when Donald Trump, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1178.1200000000001s)]
*  I think it was during the first trial, just left the country? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1182.0800000000002s)]
*  He went to Scotland and Ireland before he was going to testify. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1185.6000000000001s)]
*  And I was always wondering this as someone covering the trial. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1189.1200000000001s)]
*  Was the deposition so effective that she didn't really care [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1194.72s)]
*  if he testified one way or another? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1197.84s)]
*  And when he was him leaving the country, a bigger statement in and of itself [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1199.9599999999998s)]
*  and not showing up to his own trial that it was like because you could have [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1205.32s)]
*  potentially as the plaintiff forced him to testify in the trial. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1209.36s)]
*  How much of that can you share with us? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1214.76s)]
*  Because I've always been wondering that. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1216.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so we were pretty happy with the deposition. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1217.8799999999999s)]
*  No, I turned out and we did not need to put him in our case [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1220.1599999999999s)]
*  as long as we could show the deposition, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1223.9199999999998s)]
*  parts of the deposition that we showed to the jury, which the judge permitted. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1225.52s)]
*  There were a lot of bets going on on our side of the team [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1229.28s)]
*  about whether he would actually show up. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1232.0s)]
*  I don't know. I can't speak for Joe Takapina, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1234.72s)]
*  but I think Joe was quite worried that if he did show up, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1236.8799999999999s)]
*  then we would be able to show these clips to him and it would look even worse. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1241.0s)]
*  But Judge Kaplan, it was kind of driving us all crazy [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1245.6s)]
*  because Judge Kaplan gave him until first, he said 10 p.m. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1248.04s)]
*  And then I said, could you make it 5 p.m. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1251.6s)]
*  on the Sunday before closings to change his mind? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1253.9199999999998s)]
*  And when he appealed that case to the Second Circuit at the argument [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1258.52s)]
*  and they said to him to his counsel and then to me, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1263.12s)]
*  you know, did Mr. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1267.08s)]
*  would have been harmless there for any of the things he's complaining about? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1267.8799999999999s)]
*  Would it made a difference? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1270.24s)]
*  And my answer was no. I said he did not put in any evidence. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1271.84s)]
*  He had every chance to show up. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1274.52s)]
*  And he did it. He may be sitting behind me in the courtroom today, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1276.24s)]
*  but he wasn't there at the trial. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1279.32s)]
*  And I think the jury understood exactly what that meant. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1280.72s)]
*  Well, Ben, she's again unusual. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1283.68s)]
*  She's being modest, which is unusual for Robbie. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1286.72s)]
*  But if he had showed up, then [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1289.68s)]
*  can you imagine Robbie Kaplan cross examining Donald Trump on the stand? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1293.52s)]
*  Just picture that she would pull his head off from his shoulders [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1299.72s)]
*  and feed it to him, because once she had him in the chair [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1303.92s)]
*  and was cross examining him, it would have been a terrible, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1308.36s)]
*  terrible massacre. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1313.36s)]
*  So I think Taka Pina suggested me not show up. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1315.48s)]
*  You know, I'll close with this and I want to hear from both of you. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1320.6s)]
*  There's so many lessons that I think we can extract from the trial. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1323.48s)]
*  Now, unfortunately, that Trump is in office. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1327.28s)]
*  I mean, you talk about Donald Trump running away from the trial [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1329.52s)]
*  to avoid being cross examined. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1334.68s)]
*  And then whining about it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1336.64s)]
*  I mean, just think about this past week, Donald Trump leaves the G7 [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1338.16s)]
*  the day before President Zelensky is supposed to arrive. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1341.96s)]
*  He can't stay in a room with world leaders and adults [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1345.3200000000002s)]
*  who are having difficult conversations for more than a short period of time. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1348.3200000000002s)]
*  So there are these behavioral traits that I think can be extrapolated [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1352.16s)]
*  on human behavior, which I've always tried to break down from my audience [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1356.5200000000002s)]
*  as being weakness and being, you know, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1361.4s)]
*  for all of these qualities, you know, being unfit to serve. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1365.3600000000001s)]
*  And of course, being found liable for sexual assault, being a characteristic [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1369.72s)]
*  that should make you unfit as a shouldn't make you a leader. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1374.44s)]
*  And then, of course, Donald Trump goes around and he gives speeches [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1378.52s)]
*  to the young Republicans. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1381.5600000000002s)]
*  And he says, when I said what I said on the Access Hollywood, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1383.0400000000002s)]
*  that was the most courageous thing any person's ever done before. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1386.0800000000002s)]
*  And you and you look at that. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1389.5600000000002s)]
*  And I'm just like, when, when, when, when did we get like this? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1390.72s)]
*  And how is this the world that we're living in? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1394.04s)]
*  Because these qualities setting aside Republican, Democrat, it's just not good. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnJMW8W17_E&t=1397.08s)]
