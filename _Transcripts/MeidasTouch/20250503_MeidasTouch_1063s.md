# Trump handed CRUSHING DEFEAT in AM…IT’S HAPPENING
**MeidasTouch:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E)
*  As usual, Donald Trump's been attacking judges on his social media platform [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=0.0s)]
*  and attacking political opponents, calling them communists, leftists, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=5.36s)]
*  spreading conspiracy theories and lies. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=9.68s)]
*  But this morning, Donald Trump was handed yet another stunning rebuke from overseas. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=11.92s)]
*  The election results are in from Australia. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=18.48s)]
*  The current Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, from the Labour Party, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=22.0s)]
*  which is their Liberal Party in Australia, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  is not just going to go on to win the elections in Australia. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=29.36s)]
*  He has trounced their right-wing party, their conservative far-right leaning party, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=34.24s)]
*  which is called the Liberal Party in Australia, just to make it a little more confusing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=40.16s)]
*  And not only that, the Teamu Trump candidate who leads the Liberal Party, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=45.04s)]
*  again, liberal in Australia means the Conservative Party, I just want to make that clear, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  a guy by the name of Peter Dutton lost his seat in Dixon, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=54.16s)]
*  the same way Pierre Poliev, Teamu Trump in Canada lost his riding in the elections in Canada, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  where the Liberal Party in Canada, which is actually the Liberal Party, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=67.36s)]
*  went on to form a minority government. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=70.64s)]
*  Prime Minister Mark Carney, the Liberal Party leader, went on to win there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=73.12s)]
*  Similar results we're seeing right in Canada and Australia, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=77.84s)]
*  where if you look back just a few months ago, the right-wing, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=82.0s)]
*  MAGA-styled parties that use the language like, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=86.48s)]
*  woke this, woke that, enemy of the people, the news, all the Trump stuff, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=89.84s)]
*  those parties were leading and then in a stark reversal, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=95.68s)]
*  the left parties, the pro-democracy parties, went on to win. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=100.4s)]
*  It's now officially being reported Australian Prime Minister, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=105.68s)]
*  has been re-elected as his Labour Party surged to victory, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=109.27999999999999s)]
*  projected to form a majority government in Australia and in a historic first, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=113.27999999999999s)]
*  opposition leader, Teamu Trump, Peter Dutton, often likened to Trump, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  hence, Teamu Trump lost his own seat in Dixon. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=123.36s)]
*  Let's check in right now with the victory speech from Prime Minister of Australia, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=127.28s)]
*  Anthony Albanese, and in this speech, he makes a powerful call to action [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=132.48s)]
*  for Australians to also feel proud about being Australia and to look to itself [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=137.6s)]
*  for strength and not to imitate, not to copy, not to try to ever be like the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=143.44s)]
*  MAGA virus that has infected parts of the United States. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=149.76s)]
*  Here play this clip. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=154.0s)]
*  My fellow Australians, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=155.28s)]
*  serving as your Prime Minister is the greatest honour of my life. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=172.08s)]
*  And it is with a deep sense of humility and a profound sense of responsibility [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=177.44s)]
*  that the first thing that I do tonight is to say thank you to the people of Australia [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=190.08s)]
*  for the chance to continue to serve the best nation on earth. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  Today, the Australian people have voted for Australian values, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=201.6s)]
*  for fairness, aspiration and opportunity for all, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=210.72s)]
*  for the strength to show courage in adversity and kindness to those in need. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=218.56s)]
*  In this time of global uncertainty, Australians have chosen optimism and determination. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=225.6s)]
*  Australians have chosen to face global challenges the Australian way, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  looking after each other while building for the future. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=244.64s)]
*  Let's be real, doing laundry kinda sucks, but you know it doesn't? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=248.56s)]
*  Smelling amazing. That's why I'm obsessed with Laundry Sauce, the world's best smelling laundry [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  pods. No more clothes that smell stale and gross, now I step out in Australian Sandalwood. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=260.64s)]
*  Let me tell you, people notice. Compliments on my laundry? Never thought that would happen. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=266.4s)]
*  And it's not just about the scent, these pods are four times concentrated with serious cleaning [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=271.44s)]
*  power. They tackle stains or vibe fabrics and leave everything smelling like a high end cologne. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=276.88s)]
*  Oh, and if you're into fresh, clean vibes, their new Oregon Mint scent is a game changer. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=282.48s)]
*  I literally just started a load of wash right before I recorded this with that one. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=288.24s)]
*  It's so convenient and such high quality, what else can you ask for? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=292.0s)]
*  If you put your new luxury laundry obsession on autopilot, you save an extra 15-20% off [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=297.04s)]
*  every order when you subscribe. And you could start right now with your first one, because [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=303.12s)]
*  right now you get 20% off your entire order at LaundrySauce.com with code minus 20. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=306.96s)]
*  That's LaundrySauce.com code minus 20, M-E-I-D-A-S-2-0. And after you order, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=314.24s)]
*  tell them we sent you smell good, look good, feel good with Laundry Sauce. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's just stunning again, right? Because if you take a look at the polling in Canada, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=326.0s)]
*  where the Conservative Party was leading in Canada a few months back, and then all of a [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=331.52s)]
*  sudden the Liberal Party in Canada led by Prime Minister Mark Cardy shot up, same thing we're [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=336.24s)]
*  seeing in Australia. And this is described simply as the Trump effect. Australia, Canada, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  we're going to see elections elsewhere soon as well. They're seeing what went down in the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=350.88s)]
*  United States. They're seeing Trump and Musk and the wrecking ball as they've destroyed [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=355.68s)]
*  what used to be the world's strongest economy. And these other countries are saying, not now, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=361.76s)]
*  not ever. We need to protect our democracies here. We're rejecting the Timu Trump, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=368.24s)]
*  the Timu-Maga-styled candidates and politicians here. Bye-bye, Pierre Poliev. Bye-bye, Peter [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=375.04s)]
*  Dutton. Although a footnote to that, and this is what a loser Pierre Poliev is, he basically [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=382.4s)]
*  forced out another Conservative member from the Conservative members riding in Alberta, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=388.4s)]
*  which is nowhere near where Pierre Poliev's riding is when Pierre Poliev lost his election. So Poliev [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=393.84s)]
*  basically stole the seat of another Conservative member because Poliev still wants to be in [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=400.64s)]
*  parliament and the other member forfeited it to him. I mean, really embarrassing stuff, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=406.08s)]
*  but that's a MAGA mentality. They just can't accept a loss right there. All right. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=410.0s)]
*  Bringing things back to domestic affairs here in the United States, this morning as well, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=414.8s)]
*  we're hearing more about a dire situation on the ports. How long have I been talking about the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=419.36s)]
*  ports here on the Midas Touch Network? We've been talking about freight volumes. We've been talking [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=425.36s)]
*  about trucking volumes here. And I think it's very important because you can track how this tariff [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=430.16s)]
*  war, trade war, disastrous Liberation Day, which is really Depression Day, Recession Day, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=437.36s)]
*  Liquidation Day, whatever you want to call it, how it has harmed trade into the United States. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=444.48s)]
*  Remember, we've been following the ports of Seattle, the ports of Long Beach in Los Angeles. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=450.48s)]
*  We've been following the ports in Boston. I want you to hear this morning from the head of the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=454.64s)]
*  port of Los Angeles what he is seeing. Here, play this clip. Just describe for us, let's take a beat, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  really frame it for us, how much volume has just dropped off in the last few weeks? Yeah, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=464.64s)]
*  about a third of the import volume, which means give or take about 50,000 20 foot equivalent units [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=469.91999999999996s)]
*  gone off the arrivals coming in next week. From next week is when you expect to see this really [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  hit. That's correct. And that matches up. The announcements back on April 2nd, then on April [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  8th, a little bit of a change on everybody, ex-China, Mexico, Canada. And those arrivals [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  are coming at us this weekend. We'll of course dedicate time to your port, but I'm just wondering [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=492.4s)]
*  how you're anticipating this rolls and ripples through the economy from here, how it hits trucking [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=496.4s)]
*  when this turns up on the shelf? What's the distance, the time from when you see a drop [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  off in volume and when we as consumers see the shortages? Right. So CEOs are telling me hit the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=505.12s)]
*  pause button, right? I'm not going to import anymore at these kinds of prices. Let's wait and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=510.47999999999996s)]
*  see. I don't know if it's going to be two hours, two days or two weeks until I get some clarity. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=514.8s)]
*  Then hiring off the table for right now. Capital investment pause. And the retailers are telling [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=521.0400000000001s)]
*  me that realistically, with even the 10%, I'm going to have to pass it on to the consumers. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=527.2800000000001s)]
*  So how much is this really coming from all over? It's not just about China. This is about really [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=532.48s)]
*  global trade coming to a standstill until there is a much greater degree of certainty and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=537.12s)]
*  a much lower tariff rate than even the baseline that's been put out there. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=542.32s)]
*  Yeah. When I was last with you all, Lisa, I said global trade is going to slow, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=545.6s)]
*  economies will follow and that's exactly what we're seeing. Back in November, so many of us were [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=548.96s)]
*  wringing our hands about 4% inflation. We've just added 10 percentage points of imports coming out [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=553.28s)]
*  of Southeast Asia for our port and these unbelievable numbers out of China. Now that's [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=558.48s)]
*  just facts. I want to bring you the facts here and that is very dangerous. I mean, I've been [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=563.76s)]
*  describing it like this. Remember with COVID, Donald Trump said like a miracle, it's all going [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=570.0s)]
*  to go away. Don't worry. There are seven cases, but the cases are going to disappear. It's never [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=574.64s)]
*  going to hit our shores. And then the lie started. Inject bleach. Then they blamed Dr. Fauci. He's [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=580.16s)]
*  doing that again with this disastrous trade war thing that he's doing right here over and over [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=585.6s)]
*  again. I say when is there going to be that Tom Hanks moment? Remember Tom Hanks got COVID and [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=593.6s)]
*  everyone was like, oh crap, I guess this thing is real. There's going to be a moment. Is that five [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=599.28s)]
*  days? Is it 10 days when things aren't on the shelf and then Americans are like, whoa, whoa, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=604.16s)]
*  whoa. I'm like, yeah, we've been warning you here on the Midas Touch Network. Talking about other [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=608.56s)]
*  domestic affairs, dog killer, Homeland Security Secretary, Kristi Noem was making her rounds [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=613.6s)]
*  on state regime media known as Fox this morning. She was saying that Abrego Garcia's wife [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=620.3199999999999s)]
*  is lying that she wants her husband back from the concentration camp in El Salvador. This is how sick [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=629.0400000000001s)]
*  these mega vile pieces of trash are. I mean, how else can I describe it? Kristi Noem is saying that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=638.48s)]
*  Abrego Garcia's wife prefers her husband to be in a concentration camp in El Salvador. He has no [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=646.72s)]
*  criminal history. He's got three kids, three American kids. She's an American woman living [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=652.4000000000001s)]
*  in Maryland. Abrego Garcia worked for a union. He had a work permit given to him by the Trump [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=656.72s)]
*  administration in 2019. Here, Kristi Noem says that, well, she goes, I think Abrego Garcia's wife is an [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=661.68s)]
*  abuse victim and I know victims. As a victim, she says she wants her husband back, but she doesn't [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=670.4s)]
*  want her husband back. She's better off with him in the concentration camp. You think she didn't say [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=677.28s)]
*  that? Here's what you're like, I'm sure Kristi Noem says that. I mean, these are vile people. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=682.24s)]
*  Here's what Kristi Noem said. Let's play the clip. Yeah, absolutely. And that's what I'm concerned [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=686.08s)]
*  about. What she's saying today is, is she still scared? So many people and victims I've worked [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=690.32s)]
*  with over the years, you know, they say one thing in public because they have to, to survive or to [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=695.6800000000001s)]
*  protect their children. So I wouldn't say that, you know, what she's saying today is how she really [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=700.96s)]
*  feels. I think she- Now, I want to show you this as well because you remember, was it last week [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=706.1600000000001s)]
*  where Donald Trump was lying and saying that Warren Buffett, this is what Trump posted. Remember, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=710.8s)]
*  Trump wrote, Warren Buffett supports or helped Donald Trump come up with the plan [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=716.0799999999999s)]
*  to tank the markets in order to rebuild better, to cause pain and suffering and destroy people's [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=722.56s)]
*  lives. Donald Trump actually made a video like this and said, Warren Buffett endorsed this plan. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=730.24s)]
*  Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway two weeks ago had to come out with a statement and said, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=735.52s)]
*  we don't know what this is. We don't endorse this plan. We don't like it. Warren Buffett was [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=740.8s)]
*  speaking though earlier and Warren Buffett said, trade should not be used as a weapon. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=745.28s)]
*  Okay. The Oracle of Omaha right here is making it very clear. What the hell are we doing? So maybe [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=751.3599999999999s)]
*  you don't want to listen to me. Maybe you don't want to listen to the head of the port of Long [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=758.16s)]
*  Beach or Los Angeles. We want to listen to Warren Buffett. I can give you more data points here this [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=762.0s)]
*  morning as well. Play this clip. No question that trade can be an act of war. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=766.4s)]
*  I think it's led to bad things. Just the attitudes it's brought out [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=776.88s)]
*  in the United States. I mean, we should be looking to trade with the rest of the world and we should [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=786.48s)]
*  do what we do best and they should do what they do best. And I don't think it... [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=790.72s)]
*  That's what we did originally. I mean, we were going to producing tobacco and cotton [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=804.1600000000001s)]
*  250 years ago and we traded it. And we want a prosperous world. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=810.5600000000001s)]
*  Eight countries with nuclear weapons, including a few that are what I would call quite unstable. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=821.52s)]
*  I do not think it's a great idea to try and design a world where a few countries say, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=828.24s)]
*  ha ha ha, we've won and other countries are envious. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=834.4s)]
*  Now this morning as well, or I should say yesterday, Donald Trump, last night, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=844.08s)]
*  Donald Trump was posting AI images of him as the Pope. That's what Donald Trump was doing. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=848.24s)]
*  Again, I think just like being incredibly offensive to the Catholic community. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=856.32s)]
*  I mean, what is this? He's posting AI images of himself as the Pope. By the way, after Lindsey [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=861.04s)]
*  Graham made a serious... This is real. Lindsey Graham made a serious post saying that he thinks [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=868.5600000000001s)]
*  that Donald Trump should be considered to become the next Pope. And then Donald Trump said he would [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=874.64s)]
*  like to be the Pope. He made public statements. I barely got any attention. We covered it here on [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=880.08s)]
*  the Midas Touch Network. I mean, you see Lindsey Graham's post right there. Finally, you have, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=887.12s)]
*  in addition to Donald Trump posting AI images of himself as the Pope, you've got Pete Hegseth [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=892.48s)]
*  posting cartoons of himself holding swords that say budget cuts, even though they're now making [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=897.36s)]
*  the new defense budget $1 trillion. It's going to be significantly more. The deficit's going to go [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=904.4s)]
*  significantly higher. Donald Trump has announced that he is doing a parade. He's on his birthday. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=910.56s)]
*  He wants to do a military parade. 6,000 soldiers, 50 helicopters. He's going to have jets flying [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=916.16s)]
*  over in the sky. It's going to cost like $100 million for Donald Trump's one-day birthday [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=925.52s)]
*  on the taxpayer dime so he can look like Kim Jong-un with a military parade in Washington, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=931.2s)]
*  D.C. Are you absolutely kidding me? I want to leave you with this. Donald Trump got another [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=937.2800000000001s)]
*  strong rebuke in federal court when a federal judge from Washington, D.C., Judge Beryl Howell, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=943.0400000000001s)]
*  granted a permanent injunction and granted summary judgment in favor of a law firm called [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=949.6s)]
*  Perkins-Cooey for Donald Trump's patently unlawful orders attacking the law firms. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=956.16s)]
*  Let me read you a portion from the order from Judge Beryl Howell. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=966.8s)]
*  Only when lawyers make the choice to challenge rather than back down when confronted with [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=971.12s)]
*  government action raising nontrivial constitutional issues can a case be brought to court for judicial [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=976.64s)]
*  review of the legal merits as was done in this case by Plaintiff Perkins-Cooey, LLP, Plaintiff's [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=982.96s)]
*  Council, Williams & Connolly, and the lawyers, firms, organizations, and individuals who submitted [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=988.72s)]
*  amicus briefs in this case. If the founding history of this country is any guide, those who [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=994.1600000000001s)]
*  stood up in court to vindicate constitutional rights and by so doing serve to promote the rule [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=999.44s)]
*  of law will be the models lauded when this period of American history is written. Be on the right [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGBtNBCC2E&t=1006.0s)]
