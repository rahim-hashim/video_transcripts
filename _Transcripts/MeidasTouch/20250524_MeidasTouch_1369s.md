**MeidasTouch:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0)
*  State regime media known as Fox was having a full meltdown yesterday as Donald Trump was panic-posting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=0.0s)]
*  Attacking the European Union with threats of more tariffs. Donald Trump threatened to tariff an individual American company, Apple [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=6.92s)]
*  So what did state regime media known as Fox do? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=14.84s)]
*  They started attacking former President Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama saying that their behavior [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=17.72s)]
*  Was very unbecoming for people who won the Nobel Peace Prize here play this clip [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=25.560000000000002s)]

*  I don't want to get too much into their bedroom [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=40.28s)]
*  But the point is the point is I know I don't see Mother Teresa being worried about the temperature or Albert Schweitzer [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  You know needing an extra, but I mean it just it doesn't fit the idea of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=49.88s)]
*  My old idea of what a Nobel Peace Prize winner would be willing to do. I don't know. Are you saying it's not noble? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=54.92s)]

*  Then they brought on Tulsi Gabbard in the ultimate moment of projection saying don't be surprised when the bad actors [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  accuse us of the very things that they are guilty of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=74.88s)]
*  These MAGAs are the most sinister sick people [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=78.64s)]
*  Imaginable watch this playing this clip. I mean, yes, we talked about activist judges [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=83.06s)]

*  Evade law enforcement who had him in there in their custody and they've been able to get away with this for two reasons number one [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=93.42s)]
*  There has been no transparency and because there's been no transparency [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=99.9s)]
*  There has been no accountability and this is what we are seeking to bring about [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=104.18s)]
*  This is what the responsibility and and mission that I take very seriously is to shine a light as [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=108.86s)]
*  As has been done in this video as has been done in the documents that we are declassifying [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=115.22s)]
*  shine a light on areas and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=121.14s)]
*  Places that have not seen the light of day for a very long time and have allowed many bad actors within our own government [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=123.58s)]
*  to get it to get away with either crimes or [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=130.34s)]
*  Unconstitutional acts and underlying our God-given rights and freedoms that that exists within the Constitution and that serve as the foundation of our [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=134.18s)]
*  Republic and and the last thing I'll say on this will is as we continue down this process [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=142.38s)]
*  Don't be surprised that we will see the very same playbook that that has been used for a very long time in this country [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=147.1s)]
*  Where those very bad actors and their friends in in the legacy and mainstream propaganda media will accuse us of? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=153.42s)]
*  The very things that they are guilty of in order to try to deflect away from how they and their actions are [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=161.1s)]

*  Tulsi Gabbard who literally ordered her own intelligence team to destroy their own [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=176.58s)]
*  Intelligence reports that were accurate that undercut Donald Trump and to fabricate fake intelligence reports to support the regime [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=182.94s)]
*  She is a vile and despicable human being speaking of vile and despicable human beings [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=191.06s)]
*  Then they have dr. Oz on Fox and dr. Oz talks about why he believes [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=196.58s)]
*  It's the right decision that the Trump regime has now banned people under the age of 65 [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=202.86s)]
*  From getting kovat boosters and kovat shots unless you can prove to the regime [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=209.78s)]
*  That you are not healthy and that you desperately need it if the regime doesn't approve it though [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=215.5s)]
*  Their plan is you don't get the kovat shot anymore. What despicable vile people with holding a vaccine [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=221.06s)]
*  From Americans while you spread [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=228.02s)]

*  You gotta put in the stop to the boosters for everyone [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=237.94s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=241.5s)]
*  Well, we're asking again that folks go back and kick the tires and what's really in their best interest [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  The FDA lead Marty McCreary has said in a beautiful article this week in the New England Journal that you need to give [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=247.98s)]
*  Boosters if you want to seniors, but you can't force them on young people [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=254.26s)]
*  Because we don't have enough evidence that it makes sense for them [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=257.54s)]
*  So we're still gonna pay for it CMS will pay for the these booster shots for kovat [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=259.94s)]
*  But it doesn't make sense for us to demand [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=264.14s)]
*  Mandate that it's not necessary for everyone. All right, doc. I think you guys are following the science on this [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=266.54s)]
*  I'm glad we got new folks in that are looking at the actual numbers now [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=272.66s)]

*  Kermit the frog and they were upset at Kermit and they did all of these [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=282.06s)]
*  I'm only gonna show you a small segment, but they said Kermit's really bad a bad frog here play this clip [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=286.29999999999995s)]
*  Not bad Riley. What do you think? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=293.46s)]
*  Imagine being a 22 year old student who is graduating with your degree in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=297.17999999999995s)]

*  Entrepreneurs or veterans or innovators they picked Kermit the frog [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=313.62s)]
*  We have students who are drowning in debt who are struggling to find jobs and universities are handing the mic to puppets now puppets [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=318.38s)]
*  Like many Democratic elected leaders like a real puppet. It's all theater literally [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=325.06s)]
*  So I see this as the same institutions who have been pushing [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=330.65999999999997s)]
*  Political agendas and cancel culture now want to use a puppet to inspire students. It's unserious [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=335.14s)]
*  It's out of touch and frankly, it's insulting mind you the reason they are doing this is because Trump was once again [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=341.7s)]
*  tanking the economy [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=349.17999999999995s)]
*  Trump held his [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=350.78s)]

*  billion dollars in market value of Apple to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=365.14000000000004s)]
*  Tank as a result of saying he was going after Apple and then he attacked the European Union [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=370.26000000000005s)]
*  Horrible stuff. That's why they're doing this then they bring on this guy Magga Republican Congressmember [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=376.98s)]
*  Randy Fine and he says this is his exact sentence the entire [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=382.9s)]
*  Palestinian cause is evil. Do you hear that Palestinians for Trump this what these people think that the entire [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=388.65999999999997s)]
*  Palestinian existence is evil. That's what they're saying right now play this clip [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=395.53999999999996s)]
*  The fact of the matter is the Palestinian cause is evil and you see it and how they behave here is predicated on lies [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  Mistruths seriously, then they have Treasury Secretary Scott Besson on and [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=407.02000000000004s)]
*  Scott Besson is asked because now they have to have [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=414.06s)]
*  Treasury Secretary propaganda and this guy Scott Besson is the worst. He's the most arrogant dude imaginable [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=417.42s)]
*  He kind of sits there and well, I think that that's and I think that that this guy's worth almost a billion dollars [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=422.98s)]
*  He literally lived in a pink pink [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=430.58000000000004s)]
*  22 million dollar mansion that was modeled after [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=434.78000000000003s)]
*  Barbie's Malibu beach house mansion or whatever the heck it's called. So here he's asked [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=439.42s)]
*  What are you gonna do with this budget bill that passed in the house? That's gonna add trillions to the deficit [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=446.94s)]
*  He goes wow [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=453.82s)]
*  That the CBO the Congressional Budget Office. That's DC style [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=455.06s)]
*  That's just DC style scoring play this clip you mentioned economic growth in your comment there this bill adds [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=460.26000000000005s)]
*  trillions to our debt [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=467.58000000000004s)]
*  How is that acceptable to this administration? Well again? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=469.3s)]
*  the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=474.5s)]
*  You're referring to the CBO scoring I believe which is tenure scoring and it's DC style scoring [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=475.78000000000003s)]
*  so we think that we can both grow the economy and [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=482.14000000000004s)]
*  Control the debt and what's important bill is that the economy grows faster than the debt [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=486.86s)]
*  So what I would tell your viewers to focus on is what I'm focused on is what secretary [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=492.38s)]
*  Yellen was focused on is what is the total debt to GDP? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=497.3s)]
*  Because we can grow our way out of this that if we change the growth trajectory [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=501.38s)]
*  The of the country of the economy then we will stabilize our finances and grow our way out of this [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=506.34000000000003s)]
*  DC style score the big problem with someone like Scott Besson is [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=514.18s)]
*  He was supposed to be the adult in the room [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=519.3s)]
*  He was the person that Wall Street counted on to say to Donald Trump enough [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=522.46s)]
*  But no, he's a guy going it's CBO the the non-pump [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=527.62s)]
*  I'll stop doing the impression because it hurts me to do it, but the Congressional Budget Office a nonpartisan group [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=531.5s)]
*  Within the Congressional Office that says that the deficit is gonna increase by trillions. It's not DC talking points [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=538.66s)]
*  Horrific, so then Treasury Secretary Scott Besson does ask this question [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=546.78s)]
*  So who are you gonna do deals with you promised us 90 deals in 90 days? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=550.9399999999999s)]
*  You've done no deals so far and he does this line. He goes we're far along with India. No, you're not [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=555.8s)]
*  We've provided our audience with what the India Foreign Minister says he says you're not close to a deal play this clip on [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=563.02s)]
*  The tariffs that you mentioned you had a lot of discussions in Canada. Japan was a part of that [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=570.74s)]
*  You've talked about Japan a lot if the Japanese are not is not the next country to do a deal [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=575.62s)]
*  Who is? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=583.6600000000001s)]
*  as I mentioned before we're [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=585.26s)]
*  far along with India and [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=587.98s)]
*  They got in early on [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=590.3000000000001s)]
*  Many of the Asian countries have come with very good deals [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=593.58s)]
*  So there are 18 important trading partners and I would say with the exception of the EU [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=598.54s)]
*  Most are negotiating and very good faith. Who do you think goes first? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXobO_Ch0j0&t=604.9s)]
