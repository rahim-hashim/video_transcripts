# Trump RUNS SCARED after BLOWING UP World
**MeidasTouch:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js)
*  There's absolutely nothing normal about this. This morning Donald Trump wants to post about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=0.0s)]
*  everything other than these strikes on Iran. Here's what he's posting. Great unity in the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=5.92s)]
*  Republican Party. Perhaps unity like we have never seen before. What the hell does that even mean? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=12.8s)]
*  Now let's get the great, big, beautiful bill done. Our country is doing great. Maga. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Explanation point. Like the Pied Piper of destruction. Let me just spark a fire in the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=26.88s)]
*  Middle East, embroil the United States of America in a war with Israel against Iran, and then let me [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=33.76s)]
*  run back and pretend that that's not happening. And now let me take away health care from 15 [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=41.68s)]
*  million people. Here's the thing too, that as we get more intelligence about these strikes in the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=47.44s)]
*  Middle East, even the New York Times is reporting right now that while the strike on the Iranian [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=53.04s)]
*  nuclear site seemed to have caused damage, it did not destroy the Fordow nuclear site. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=59.44s)]
*  They still have their enriched uranium, and now they'll seem more likely to use it for [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=66.72s)]
*  weaponization and weapons-grade enriched uranium. You have Ayatollah Khomeini's advisor saying that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=73.68s)]
*  Iran's enriched uranium remains despite US attacks. You can take that for what it's worth. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=80.48s)]
*  But you also have high-ranking Iranian sources right now who are saying that the Trump team gave [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=87.2s)]
*  advance notice of the bombings of nuclear sites, and were insisting that, hey, these are just one-offs, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=95.36s)]
*  one-offs. Kind of like when Trump killed Soleimani. Kind of like a symbolic attack so Trump can look [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  tough. But that's not how Iran is perceiving it. I mean, they're perceiving this as war, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=109.2s)]
*  and I know that Donald Trump wants to talk about everything else. But again, this is not normal [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=113.84s)]
*  behavior right here. I had the opportunity to interview Nicole Wallace from MSNBC, and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=119.68s)]
*  we talked about normalcy, and we talked about why this second Trump administration, which I call the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=128.4s)]
*  regime, is so problematic. I'm also appearing on Nicole Wallace's podcast. I want to show you [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=136.4s)]
*  in a moment what Nicole Wallace and I had to say. I want to show you this though right here. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=143.44s)]
*  Here's what Democratic Senator Adam Schiff had to say. I just want to show you the contrast. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=149.44s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. Play this clip. In terms of is there anything positive to come out of it, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  yes, I mean, the destruction of these facilities is a positive in the sense that it will set back [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  Iran's program. And look, this is a nefarious regime that is the preeminent state sponsor of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=166.32s)]
*  terror. It should have never been pursuing a nuclear program. But it is very possible, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=173.92s)]
*  and I think we have to anticipate. Iran now kicks out any inspectors. It leaves the non-proliferation [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  treaty. And if it wasn't in a sprint for a bomb, it is now going to engage in a sprint for the bomb. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=185.6s)]
*  So a lot of uncertain. Finally, this was not constitutional, was not lawful in the absence [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=191.84s)]
*  of a declaration by Congress. And so the administration should have come to Congress. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=198.48s)]
*  We will have a vote on a war powers resolution. But there's a reason to bring this to Congress. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=204.4s)]
*  And it is you want the Congress bought in. You want the American people bought in on an action [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=209.12s)]
*  this substantial that could lead to a major outbreak of war. And now contrast that to Ron [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=214.16s)]
*  Johnson, MAGA Republican senator from Wisconsin, who says that he doesn't care that he didn't get [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=220.4s)]
*  notice about the strikes, even though Congress is supposed to have notice of the strikes. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=226.8s)]
*  Play this clip. Well, I don't know how anybody could have been surprised at this. I think [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  President Trump certainly telegraphed it. He said he's going to make his decision a couple of weeks. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=235.68s)]
*  I certainly understand why President Trump would not share that information with the Democrats in [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=240.48s)]
*  Congress. And again, the operational security is just so crucial to protect our service men and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  women. I didn't need notice. I've been saying for over a week, it'll be the president's decision. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=249.28s)]
*  I will support that decision because we cannot allow Iran, the largest state sponsor of terror, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  to become a nuclear power. And that's what they want to be. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  All right. Now let me bring in my interview with Nicole Wallace. You're not going to want to miss [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=264.0s)]
*  this. I think she lays it all out so perfectly here. Play this clip. I'm joined by Nicole Wallace, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=268.48s)]
*  host of MSNBC's Deadline White House and the new MSNBC podcast, The Best People with Nicole Wallace. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=275.04s)]
*  Me and my brothers will be appearing on that podcast. It drops on Monday. Nicole, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=283.44s)]
*  it's such an honor to have you here on the Midas Touch Network. Great to see you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=288.48s)]
*  It's such a privilege. I've listened to so many of your podcasts and to be on one is a treat. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=292.24s)]
*  I want to talk about normalcy. Now, one of the things you highlight on The Best People, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=298.24s)]
*  although I'm not necessarily sure how normal me and my brothers are, but navigating these [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  new normal, navigating these very abnormal times. You've covered wars before as a reporter. One of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=308.88s)]
*  the most solemn obligations as the president, as a commander in chief, is war powers and dealing [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=318.16s)]
*  with war and communicating to the public about what that means and putting troops on the ground, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=326.08s)]
*  what that means in terms of our military commitments. Americans are obviously very [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=332.88s)]
*  uneasy when it comes to war. We need to understand what's happening. As someone who's covered this, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  as a legend in the field, what's your response? I've really tried to come into this second Trump [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=347.44s)]
*  presidency as a newly curious student of Trump. At best, he is a guy doing a bit. This bit that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=355.2s)]
*  he does in front of the people that he's using as props is this bit of American president at war. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=366.24s)]
*  What's so tragic and what I can't get out of my own mental slideshow is Donald Trump standing [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=375.52s)]
*  with John Kelly at Arlington, incapable of comprehending why someone would fight and die [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=382.88s)]
*  for their own country. If you go to the most basic thing that his job is really about, it's about [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=389.28s)]
*  being the commander in chief, sitting atop the chain of command of the greatest military in the world, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  full of men and women who love this country so much they would die for it. It makes most people [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=403.68s)]
*  cry even if it's not the choice they make. To Trump, it's something in his own telling. He [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=408.24s)]
*  can't get his brain around. Didn't want to go and visit veterans of World War I when he was in France, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=414.32s)]
*  believes that people who are captured are losers and suckers, believes that people who are injured [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=421.52s)]
*  in the line of duty shouldn't be seen in military events. All that reporting has been done by the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  Atlantic and other places. To hear him do his bit about it is trivializing the gravest part of the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=435.84s)]
*  job. But to think about him actually in this capacity as the country's only commander in chief [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  is tragic. It's really one of the most tragic parts of having him back as president. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=451.44s)]
*  He is doing this bit that is directed at a certain audience and really a certain audience only [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=456.23999999999995s)]
*  here in the United States. The shtick doesn't work internationally and we live in a globalized [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=464.32s)]
*  world. When you start to say, Xi Jinping called me and he begged me and said, is this embarrassing [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=471.84s)]
*  that I'm giving you a call, Donald? I said to Xi Jinping, this is not an embarrassing thing. I'm [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=480.4s)]
*  glad you called me. Xi Jinping is like, that never happened. I'm not calling you. What in the world [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=484.96s)]
*  are you even talking about? Or when Donald Trump goes, I negotiated the ceasefire between India [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=490.4s)]
*  and Pakistan. I did it. I mediated it. And Modi's like, you didn't. You had nothing to do with it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  What are you talking about? And by the way, let's have a meeting in the G7 to talk about it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=502.8s)]
*  You had all these countries that had very important meetings with Donald Trump lined up for [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=508.08s)]
*  Tuesday, the second day of the G7. Anthony Albanese in Australia because they have to figure out what [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=513.68s)]
*  the heck is happening with AUKUS, the Australia, UK, US trilateral deal. And Trump doesn't even [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=520.9599999999999s)]
*  know what AUKUS stands for. Trump just doesn't show up on Tuesdays. He screws Modi. He screws [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=527.04s)]
*  Albanese. He screws President Claudia Sheinbaum and all of these people. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=532.88s)]
*  All of them, yeah. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=537.28s)]
*  And they're all just moving beyond him. His bit though is causing, I think, people to [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=538.16s)]
*  move away from America right now. That's what I'm seeing. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=543.76s)]
*  Well, and listen, I worked for a president who became unpopular in a very different way [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=546.3199999999999s)]
*  than Trump did, but unpopular all the same. And it had at its genesis the wars in Iraq [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=554.4799999999999s)]
*  and Afghanistan. But the thing that made the American people so unhappy and uncomfortable [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=562.0799999999999s)]
*  was one, the tragedy and the reality of war, two, the predicates for particularly the Iraq war, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=568.08s)]
*  but three, being isolated on the world stage. Americans hate going it alone. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=575.2s)]
*  And what you just articulated is American isolationism by design. Trump has designed [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=581.76s)]
*  an America that is totally apart from all of our allies by walking away from the greatest [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=588.24s)]
*  alliance, the greatest peacekeeping alliance, the world in human history, NATO. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=594.48s)]
*  And I think the idea that he is opting out of America's alliances, which men and women [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=600.32s)]
*  fought and died for, is very discomforting to a vast majority of Americans. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=605.44s)]
*  There's a lot of propaganda right now happening in the US. It feels sometimes in our coverage here [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=611.12s)]
*  like we're living in North Korea with some stuff that I see out there. And whether it's independent [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=618.4s)]
*  media or the growth of digital media, I think is playing a major part in filling a void. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  I know that you're leaning heavily into doing more things on digital. The launch of the podcast, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=633.68s)]
*  The Best People, was also part of that effort to not just have the audience engaged with you [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=639.76s)]
*  incredible show you do on Amazon, BC, to meet people on these other kind of growing platforms. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=646.64s)]
*  Can you speak to how you see the evolution of the media right now and kind of how you're adapting [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=652.0799999999999s)]
*  in that environment to get out this truthful information to the people? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=660.0s)]
*  So I, you know, a big sports house, my son plays baseball, my husband's covered baseball, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=665.04s)]
*  we're big baseball fans. And sometimes we sit with the scouts and there are always scouts from [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=670.72s)]
*  other teams scouting the competition. And I think the pro democracy side in the mainstream media, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=676.4s)]
*  legacy media, stopped scouting the threats to democracy. They thought they were above them. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=683.2s)]
*  And I think the attraction that certainly your audience and mine has to the content that we put [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=688.1600000000001s)]
*  out that holds the causal lie a lie that says bullshit when bullshit is the only word that [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=696.88s)]
*  accurately describes the nonsense coming out of a MAGA politician. You have to understand what the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=702.88s)]
*  other side is doing to beat them at the ballot box. And I went and spent some time with folks [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=710.88s)]
*  close to Obama right after the election. And he said, none of the conversations about who we're [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=716.32s)]
*  going to be when we grow up matter if you don't, if you can't win, if you can't appeal to majority [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=722.64s)]
*  of Americans. And so I think scouting what the anti democratic, the threats to democracy, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=727.5999999999999s)]
*  scouting what they've done with content, how they've made disinformation and misinformation [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=733.4399999999999s)]
*  feel like a club people want to be a part of is an imperative lesson. And the community you guys [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=738.64s)]
*  have created is I think the first answer. It's the front line. You're so quick. You watch Fox News, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=743.8399999999999s)]
*  you have a dispassionate takedown of that, which is absolute nonsense and disinformation. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=751.12s)]
*  And then you get to the truth and you do it in a way that is so sticky. People come to you, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=757.2s)]
*  they come to you all day. They come to you for breaking news. They come to you when they know [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=761.6s)]
*  you have new content. And I think that's the model. That's how you win the future. That's how you keep [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=765.12s)]
*  the country a democracy. Talk to us about the types of guests you're going to have on the best [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=769.36s)]
*  people. Obviously, we're on it on Monday, but what are you looking to have on the show and what [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=775.2s)]
*  sets this podcast apart from other podcasts that are out there? Well, first I would say I'm learning [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=782.6400000000001s)]
*  some open to suggestions, but there are a group of people that, you know, I think if you get to do [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=787.5200000000001s)]
*  what we get to do, you get to talk to our listeners and our audiences. You have to keep your, make [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=794.1600000000001s)]
*  sure that you're still growing and cracking your mind open. So I love talking to Doc Rivers about [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=800.32s)]
*  he lived in a battleground state. He leads men. He leads some of the most elite athletes in the [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=806.6400000000001s)]
*  country. And he knows a lot about leadership. And I think there's something completely transferable [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=814.48s)]
*  between leadership in sports and leadership in a civic context. So I talked to Doc this week. It's [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=820.0s)]
*  also the last week of a very exciting final series in the NBA. I talked to Sarah Jessica Parker, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=825.28s)]
*  who is known for the iconic character, Carrie Bradshaw, someone she's played for three decades, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=832.0s)]
*  but she cares so deeply about literacy and libraries and social security. And she grew up, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=837.76s)]
*  you know, she would say not wanting for anything, but really benefiting from things that were made [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=844.0s)]
*  available to everyone through public libraries, through benefit systems. And so she's very, very [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=849.68s)]
*  cognizant of how reckless the entire Trump cabinet is and how they talk about all those things. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=855.76s)]
*  I talked to Rachel Meadow, who's my North Star professionally, my friend and my colleague, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=862.16s)]
*  Kara Swisher, who's so smart about this space. And really, I feel like I asked the most advice [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=867.04s)]
*  of people like Kara and you and your brothers, because this is where I think, I think if you [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=874.32s)]
*  study where autocratic movements have failed, they fail in the pro democracy side bands together and [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=879.84s)]
*  realizes that they're stronger together. We are not in competition with one another. It is our [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=886.08s)]
*  job in this moment, if we care about the country and we care about the democracy to lift each other [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=891.2s)]
*  up, just to learn best practices from one another from the content you create. I'm totally inspired [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=895.6800000000001s)]
*  to go back to watching Fox News from the conversations you have with your brothers. I [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=900.96s)]
*  I realize that people really want to hear you work things out with people, you know, and trust where [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=906.1600000000001s)]
*  you can maybe debate and argue, but you all want the same things for the country. So I think the [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=910.72s)]
*  podcast is about some of the best people I've come across some of the best content I've consumed [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=917.6s)]
*  and really trying to learn out loud. You know, there's actually a lot in common that the country [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=923.04s)]
*  has. When you think about it, there's about 65 to 70% of the country agrees on actually most things. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=931.76s)]
*  So it's like, how did we get here? Most people want common sense gun reform. Most people support [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=940.56s)]
*  women's reproductive rights. Most people support having a job that pays wages with dignity. Most [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=945.68s)]
*  people you go down the list of all these. Most people do want there to be a border. That's a [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=952.16s)]
*  strong border, but believe that there should be paths to citizenship of people who are working [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=958.16s)]
*  hard and don't want to see people disappearing off the street. And people hate to see masked [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=962.88s)]
*  individuals walking around neighborhoods and going into Home Depot, parking lots and restaurants, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=968.9599999999999s)]
*  disappearing human beings off the streets. And, you know, you see videos like this, the LA Times [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=976.56s)]
*  put this one together. I want to show you because right now, as we're doing this interview, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  there are masked federal agents and people who are deputized by them as well, who we don't even [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=986.88s)]
*  know who the hell they are wearing masks out of a horror movie going into businesses in America [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=993.6s)]
*  here in California and across the country doing stuff like this here. I'll show you this first [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1001.44s)]
*  and arresting American citizens here. Let's play this. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1005.2s)]
*  You know, Nicole, they're going after street vendors in LA, like the people who are selling [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1035.6000000000001s)]
*  the hot dogs by the Home Depot and the people who are selling the fruit. They had masked agents in [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1042.0s)]
*  front of Dodger Stadium and the Dodgers wouldn't let them in. And then they acted like they were [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1049.52s)]
*  just hanging out at Dodger Stadium. And I look at that and I go, that's wrong. I said, I don't care [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1053.8400000000001s)]
*  what political party you are. Like, that's wrong. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1059.28s)]
*  Yeah, nobody wants that. And I think that the success that the MAGA movement had in turning [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1062.56s)]
*  people against people in this country illegally is a completely overblown mandate. It's not what [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1070.0s)]
*  people wanted. People wanted illegal people in this country illegally who had committed crimes, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1077.92s)]
*  who have received due process, who were adjudicated criminals to be sent out of our country. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1084.32s)]
*  Nobody was asked if they wanted masked law enforcement people throwing sitting senators [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1089.52s)]
*  to the ground, let alone people who've been racially profiled. I mean, the racial profiling, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1094.8s)]
*  because it's such an obvious piece of it, maybe doesn't get as much attention as it deserves. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1101.36s)]
*  But imagine the terror of being brown in America right now, even if you're a child, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1106.72s)]
*  you are subject to being hunted. I mean, that video you just played was someone being hunted [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1112.72s)]
*  on the streets of an American city for we're not aware of any crime that they committed, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1116.88s)]
*  right? There's no, there's no, I mean, the whole tenant of law enforcement is you're not even [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1121.2s)]
*  allowed to pull someone over unless you have probable cause that a crime was committed. It [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1126.5600000000002s)]
*  is now probable cause to hunt someone down while wearing a mask and potentially wrestle them to [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1129.92s)]
*  their stomach on the ground and then handcuff them without any knowledge of their status. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1135.7600000000002s)]
*  They have no knowledge of that person's immigration status. None. So I think that people, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1140.8s)]
*  I want to believe that nobody wants this. It is possible that other than Stephen Miller, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1150.88s)]
*  there are some people in the MAGA movement that want this, but this is not what Trump campaigned [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1155.2s)]
*  on and this is not what his mandate extends to. And finally, Nicole, last weekend, we saw those [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1160.88s)]
*  massive no Kings protests and it's juxtaposition to Donald Trump's disastrous dictator parade. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1167.6s)]
*  And I think the split screen you saw there of millions and millions of Americans peacefully [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1175.04s)]
*  protesting for freedom and for the love of this country. And then that miserable, sulking, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1181.1999999999998s)]
*  inconsolable Donald Trump upset that the mirror, that the military parade was a disaster and no [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1188.8s)]
*  one was really showing up. I got to get your take on all of that. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1194.24s)]
*  I saw a few minutes of John Stewart and he had some audio of a tank squeaking. And I just thought [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1197.52s)]
*  that's that encapsulates it, right? We're showing the world that our tanks squeak and I don't know [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1203.28s)]
*  if it was real or not, but look, I think it's sad for the military that Trump has made them so [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1208.24s)]
*  partisan that a parade is turned into something that is only about Trump. And I think that there [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1212.8s)]
*  are two victims here. I mean, one is the integrity of the military, which should never be impugned by [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1220.96s)]
*  any president. And Trump has sort of crossed red line after red line after red line and thrust them [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1226.24s)]
*  into the middle of his narcissistic politics and policies and designs by having them parade through [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1231.6000000000001s)]
*  the streets of DC on the 79th birthday. The other is, you know, from the ridiculous to the [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1238.48s)]
*  sublime. I mean, the protests were amazing. And to have that kind of turnout in the morning [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1248.08s)]
*  of a terrifying political assassination in Minnesota was stunning. I mean, just stunning [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1252.96s)]
*  that people understood it was a reality to be targeted for murder based on your political [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1258.96s)]
*  beliefs. And they went out in the millions and millions and millions and millions in cities and [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1264.1599999999999s)]
*  states from the bluest parts of our country to the reddest parts of our country is absolutely [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1270.96s)]
*  stunning and inspiring. And it gives me hope. Well, it gives me hope that we've got people like you [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1277.2s)]
*  out there who are delivering the news. And I love that you're expanding now into the podcast space [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1284.1599999999999s)]
*  with the best people with Nicole Wallace. I'm glad to be considered one of those. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1290.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, I love talking to all three of you. I love you guys are, I mean, in the way you guys kind of [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1294.8s)]
*  jump in and finish each other's sentences, I have two sisters and I call them I'm like, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1300.32s)]
*  we have to do something together. These guys are so cute. They're had people. People love you guys [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1304.16s)]
*  so much. And I felt so lucky to get to talk to all of you. The Midas sisters. I mean, I [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1308.4s)]
*  I'll have to have some talks with the with some of the folks at MSNBC. See if there can be a [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1316.4s)]
*  collab along those that how great would that be if you did the Midas brother version with you and [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1322.0s)]
*  your two sisters would be incredible with you guys. That would be fun. We'll have to find an [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1327.8400000000001s)]
*  occasion. Maybe, maybe the next all Kings, no Kings March. We got to do that. Nicole Wallace, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T4AhP9e6js&t=1331.52s)]
