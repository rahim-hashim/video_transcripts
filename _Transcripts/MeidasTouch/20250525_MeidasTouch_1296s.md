# FURIOUS India STRIKES BACK against Trump INSULTS
**MeidasTouch:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU)
*  India is still furious at the Trump regime and the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=0.0s)]
*  We covered this last week and I thought and still think the American media is giving this zero attention. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=4.2s)]
*  They just spew Trump propaganda when Trump says, oh, India loves us and India definitely wants to do a deal with us. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=10.38s)]
*  India feels deeply disrespected by what the Trump regime is doing and there's a few major areas that it's important that you know. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=17.3s)]
*  And again, this coverage is just not happening in the United States. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=25.3s)]
*  It's why I'm proud of the Midas Touch Network to deliver news like this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=29.04s)]
*  So there's a few areas where India is pissed. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=32.64s)]
*  Number one, Donald Trump continues to take credit for the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=35.04s)]
*  He says it over and over again. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=42.04s)]
*  Most recently, he said it when he had South African President Ramaphosa in the Oval Office. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=43.64s)]
*  Trump said, I'm the reason why that happened. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=49.64s)]
*  Trump was not the reason why it happened. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  In India, they feel very strongly. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=54.44s)]
*  The reason why it happened was that the Indian military forces did a successful operation and then Pakistan came and requested that a ceasefire happen, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=56.84s)]
*  that it was purely a bilateral discussion. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=69.14s)]
*  And by Donald Trump taking credit and saying that the reason the ceasefire happened was because Donald Trump dangled trade in front of India, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  it's deeply disrespectful. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=79.94s)]
*  Another major area that is pissing the people of India off in the government is this crypto deal that Donald Trump's family did with Pakistan. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump's family is 60% owners in this world life liberty crypto thing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=90.84s)]
*  And they did a crypto deal with the Pakistan government about six days after the terrorist attacks in Kashmir. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=96.14s)]
*  One of the other things that's pissing off the people of India is that Donald Trump continues to lie about the status of trade discussions [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=103.24s)]
*  and negotiations with India. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=111.24s)]
*  And the Trump regime makes it sound like India is begging for a deal and India is so desperate to do this deal that they're just going to give the Trump regime everything. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=113.24s)]
*  And the people of India are like, we're going to need some concessions as well. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=122.64s)]
*  And you unilaterally impose these 25% tariffs or 26% tariffs on us. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=126.74s)]
*  And that's unfair. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=133.04s)]
*  If you want to do a deal, you got to respect the sovereignty of the people of India. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=133.94s)]
*  One of the more recent things also that's pissing off India is that Donald Trump threatened Apple and he's been threatening them over and over again. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=139.73999999999998s)]
*  And Tim Cook saying do not build factories in India. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  India is like, what the heck? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=152.14s)]
*  Build factories in India. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=153.73999999999998s)]
*  We've already had discussions with Apple. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=155.04s)]
*  15% of iPhones are already made in India. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=157.54s)]
*  Apple had committed to making 25% of their iPhones. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=161.73999999999998s)]
*  And the interesting thing there is that the big iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn, doesn't really seem to give a crap about anything that Donald Trump says about iPhones building manufacturing bases in India [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=165.64s)]
*  because Foxconn is continuing with its plans to build more factories in India. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=177.83999999999997s)]
*  And again, that just shows you how feckless Donald Trump has become. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=182.33999999999997s)]
*  But the people of India are like, stop threatening Apple and telling them not to build factories in India. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=186.73999999999998s)]
*  Another major aspect that's pissing off people in India is Donald Trump's attack on American universities. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=192.94s)]
*  And you may be saying, well, why does that matter? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=199.74s)]
*  Why does that impact India? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=202.74s)]
*  Well, there are hundreds of students, foreign students from India with visas who study at Harvard University, who are now psychologically tortured and feeling horrible. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=204.34s)]
*  They don't know are they going to graduate. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=215.64s)]
*  They've invested a lot of time. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=217.04s)]
*  They don't know if they transfer out of Harvard to another school. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=218.94s)]
*  Is Trump going to do this to another school? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  They viewed the United States as a beacon for international students to study. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=224.54s)]
*  And Donald Trump has put their lives into complete and total turmoil. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=229.14s)]
*  And so those are the main issues that are really pissing India off. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=233.54s)]
*  I watch a lot of India TV right now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=239.44s)]
*  For example, I've been watching Vantage by Palki Sharma. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  I also read India Today. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=247.04s)]
*  I've also watched a lot of other programs on First Post. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=249.74s)]
*  I've watched the Indian Express and other things to try to absorb what's happening in India. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=254.54000000000002s)]
*  I try to listen to what students from India and Harvard have to say because I think giving you an international perspective is very, very, very important here. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=261.34000000000003s)]
*  I'll remind you just what Donald Trump's post was from this week when he said, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=270.14s)]
*  I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States will be manufactured and built in the United States, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=274.34s)]
*  not India or any place else. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=282.14s)]
*  If this is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=284.44s)]
*  Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=290.44s)]
*  Donald Trump's threats caused the stock price of Apple to plummet. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=292.73999999999995s)]
*  They lost $80 billion on that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=296.64s)]
*  While the Trump regime is claiming that they want to negotiate with India, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=300.14000000000004s)]
*  think about the message that sends to India's negotiators when Donald Trump is basically threatening that manufacturing plants can't be built in India [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  while they're trying to negotiate a trade deal and trying to figure something out there. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=314.94s)]
*  Let me go through with you some of the data points right now as well. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  As I mentioned, one of the programs that I've been watching lately is Palki Sharma. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=325.64s)]
*  Her program Vantage, she's the managing editor and she doesn't mince words in her reports. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=330.24s)]
*  You can check her out on the First Post YouTube channel. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=336.44s)]
*  But here's what she has to say about Donald Trump continuing to try to take credit for the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  which he had nothing to do with at all. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=348.84s)]
*  She does not mince words. Play this clip. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=351.44s)]
*  India's position, Pakistan sponsors terror and it will have to suffer the consequences. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=353.44s)]
*  And while India sends this message to the world, someone else is trying to steal the mic. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=358.74s)]
*  I'm talking about US President Donald Trump. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=363.34s)]
*  India and Pakistan decided on a ceasefire, but the announcement came from Donald Trump. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=366.04s)]
*  And since then, he's been telling a lie, repeating it on loop that he stopped this conflict. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=370.44s)]
*  On Saturday, my administration helped broker a full and immediate ceasefire. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=377.94s)]
*  I think a permanent one between India and Pakistan, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=383.14s)]
*  ending a dangerous conflict of two nations with lots of nuclear weapons. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=386.74s)]
*  Just days ago, my administration successfully brokered a historic ceasefire to stop the escalating violence between India and Pakistan. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=393.84s)]
*  And I used trade to a large extent to do it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=403.53999999999996s)]
*  I don't want to say I did, but I sure as hell helped settle the problem between Pakistan and India last week, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=407.14s)]
*  which was getting more and more hostile. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=414.34s)]
*  And Trump said it again yesterday to the South African president that he mediated the ceasefire. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=417.24s)]
*  Doing a big deal with India. We're doing a big deal with Pakistan. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=423.34s)]
*  And I said, what are you guys doing? You know, they somebody had to be the last one to shoot. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=427.24s)]
*  But the shooting was getting worse and worse, bigger and bigger, deeper and deeper into the countries. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=432.44s)]
*  And we spoke to him and we I think we, you know, I hate to say we got it settled. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=437.53999999999996s)]
*  And then two days later, something happens and they say it's Trump's fault. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=442.84s)]
*  But we Pakistan has got some excellent people and some really good great leader. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=447.44s)]
*  And India is my friend, Modi. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=455.64s)]
*  And he's a great guy. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=458.34s)]
*  And I call them both. We just did something good. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=462.53999999999996s)]
*  Yes, he's still not giving up. India has fact checked him on more than one occasion, but Trump won't let it go. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=468.73999999999995s)]
*  It's like a broken record. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=475.44s)]
*  Today, India's external affairs minister debunked Donald Trump's statements as Jaishankar is visiting Europe. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=477.03999999999996s)]
*  Earlier this week, he was in the Netherlands. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=482.84s)]
*  He was asked about US involvement in the ceasefire and Jaishankar had just one thing to say. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=484.54s)]
*  The US was in the United States, meaning Washington had no role to play. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=489.34000000000003s)]
*  And it's something that India has been saying from day one. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=496.34000000000003s)]
*  India hit terror camps in Pakistan on May 7th. Pakistan hit back. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=498.94s)]
*  That's when India struck their military bases. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=502.84000000000003s)]
*  A humble Pakistan sued for peace on May 10th. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=505.04s)]
*  Their army sent a message to India. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=507.94s)]
*  They were ready to stop firing and New Delhi responded accordingly. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=509.74s)]
*  That is the story. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=513.74s)]
*  That is how the ceasefire came about. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=515.14s)]
*  The US was informed as were many other countries. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=517.34s)]
*  None of them is claiming credit. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=520.24s)]
*  But Donald Trump wants to be the hero in the story. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=522.24s)]
*  India won't have it. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=525.14s)]
*  There is no room for the US in this conversation. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=526.54s)]
*  The Kashmir issue is bilateral. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=529.14s)]
*  Operation Sindoor was not about Kashmir. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=530.94s)]
*  It was about Pakistani terrorism. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=533.14s)]
*  India will not tolerate it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=535.14s)]
*  And when it comes to national security, India will write its own script. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=536.84s)]
*  No one, not even Donald Trump, gets to edit the ending. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=541.64s)]
*  And here's Palki Sharma from Vantage talking about how Donald Trump is making a trade deal with India very difficult. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=545.9399999999999s)]
*  But one of the things she also points out, and I want you to all be aware of this, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=554.74s)]
*  is all of the other trade deals that India has actually made with other countries throughout the world, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=558.54s)]
*  in Europe, in Asia, and elsewhere, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=563.84s)]
*  and how the threats that are coming from Donald Trump that are really hyped up here in American media, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=566.74s)]
*  it's not going to hurt India as much as Trump thinks. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=573.4399999999999s)]
*  It's definitely going to hurt India. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=577.74s)]
*  But India is diversified. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=579.64s)]
*  And the way American media presents India as like, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=581.04s)]
*  oh, India should just be grateful that any type of deal happens. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=584.34s)]
*  India is like a very proud country who cares deeply about their sovereignty. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=589.04s)]
*  And so they feel very disrespected by the type of rhetoric coming from the Trump regime. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=592.94s)]
*  Here's Palki Sharma explaining that point here at Play This Clip. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=597.84s)]
*  The best case scenario would be a zero tariff trade regime. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=623.0400000000001s)]
*  But there's a roadblock. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=630.84s)]
*  The Trump administration cannot unilaterally bring down tariffs. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=632.5400000000001s)]
*  For that, it needs approval from the U.S. Congress. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=636.5400000000001s)]
*  That is the American Parliament. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=639.74s)]
*  They must approve. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=640.94s)]
*  And that would take time. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=643.0400000000001s)]
*  If this deal goes to the U.S. Congress, it won't be signed anytime soon. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=645.24s)]
*  So India wants to keep it simple. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=650.24s)]
*  India's ask from the Trump administration is this. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  Just remove the 26% additional tariffs, the ones that Trump imposed in April. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=656.84s)]
*  Remove them. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=661.9399999999999s)]
*  That's the ask. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=663.14s)]
*  An interim deal, no congressional approval and no delays. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=664.64s)]
*  Just a fast and focused agreement that gets both sides across the finish line quickly. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=669.34s)]
*  Because both India and the U.S. want to win. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=675.84s)]
*  So this should not be a tough sell. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=678.34s)]
*  And yet it's not done till it's done. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=680.5400000000001s)]
*  So we should prepare for all scenarios. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=683.0400000000001s)]
*  What if the deal does not happen? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=684.94s)]
*  What if they do not meet the deadline? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=686.34s)]
*  What happens then? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=687.84s)]
*  The prospect should not worry India too much. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=689.94s)]
*  That is the assessment of ratings agency Moody's. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=692.24s)]
*  They have released a new report. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=695.14s)]
*  It says India is better placed than most emerging economies. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=696.44s)]
*  Trump's tariffs may slow down growth, but the Indian economy should be able to absorb the shock. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=700.24s)]
*  India has a strong domestic market. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=707.34s)]
*  It has a low dependence on exports and robust growth driven by internal factors. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=709.64s)]
*  In fact, Moody's says even if the U.S. imposes tariffs, India won't suffer significant economic damage. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=717.24s)]
*  That should be encouraging. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=724.44s)]
*  At the same time, resilience cannot be an excuse for stagnation. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=725.64s)]
*  India does not want to just survive this. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=729.84s)]
*  It wants to expand its trade. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=732.34s)]
*  And for that it is looking beyond the United States. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=734.14s)]
*  India is negotiating with a wide range of countries. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=737.14s)]
*  Some deals have already been signed. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=739.4399999999999s)]
*  India has deals with more than 10 countries in blocks including Japan, South Korea, the UAE and Australia. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=741.64s)]
*  Recently, we sealed an agreement a trade deal with the UK. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=748.04s)]
*  New Delhi will cut tariffs on 90% of British goods. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=751.74s)]
*  In return, 99% of India's exports to the UK will face no duties. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=755.24s)]
*  Similarly, talks are on with the European Union, New Zealand, Oman and Israel. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=760.9399999999999s)]
*  So India has not put all its eggs in the American basket. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=765.34s)]
*  It is building a network, a shield against Trump's uncertainty. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=768.94s)]
*  If the U.S. agreement comes through, it will be a boost. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=774.24s)]
*  If it doesn't, India is building options. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=777.94s)]
*  Now here is a program that I watched from India Today where they talked about the Trump regime revoking [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=780.94s)]
*  Harvard's ability to enroll international students. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=787.74s)]
*  And India Today approached this from the perspective as well of the students from India [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=790.94s)]
*  who have been studying at Harvard whose lives have been turned upside down here. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=796.34s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=800.74s)]
*  I'm still trying to actually grapple my head around this. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=801.5400000000001s)]
*  In the shortest of the terms, in the shortest of the time, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=805.1400000000001s)]
*  I think one of the major impact will be students who might not be able to get admission in other universities [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=808.0400000000001s)]
*  to carry forward their degrees. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=814.94s)]
*  They might have to actually leave the U.S. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=817.34s)]
*  In the longer term, I think it has many aspects. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=819.94s)]
*  It has many things that will actually have to do with the repetition of Harvard. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=824.5400000000001s)]
*  U.S. as a safe haven for taking really great education in the world. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=828.74s)]
*  It might actually have a domino effect, you know, by other universities actually tolling the line [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=833.5400000000001s)]
*  and following the diktat, I would say. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=839.5400000000001s)]
*  And it will definitely have a lot of impact on the international relations as well. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=844.1400000000001s)]
*  For Indian students, this decision has caused academic chaos and emotional distress. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=849.04s)]
*  Many are currently midway through high stakes degree programs at Harvard's law, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=854.8399999999999s)]
*  medical, business and engineering schools. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=859.74s)]
*  Those unable to transfer risk having their F1 or academic student visas invalidated, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=864.04s)]
*  which could abruptly cut short their academic journey in the United States. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=870.24s)]
*  They're going to lose their legal status unless, again, the Homeland Security reinstates the FDVP certification. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=876.0400000000001s)]
*  So, only opportunity or only way out for them from this is to change their university and get enrolled [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=887.1400000000001s)]
*  and universities which, yeah, again, whatever options they have available right now, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=898.0400000000001s)]
*  like any kind of university that they can enroll in, which would allow them to hold their legal status. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=905.74s)]
*  That's their only option. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=912.34s)]
*  As Harvard prepares its legal and institutional response, the global academic community is watching closely. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=915.5400000000001s)]
*  For hundreds of Indian students and scholars, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=924.44s)]
*  the coming weeks will determine whether their American dream continues or ends abruptly. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=927.14s)]
*  And here you'll see that the here's how India is responding to Donald Trump's threats against Apple. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=932.5400000000001s)]
*  And India has assured its people that Apple will continue to invest in India, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=940.5400000000001s)]
*  getting that 15% of iPhones being built in India to the 25% that India and Apple are really trying to do. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=946.94s)]
*  And India is saying, you know, look, Donald Trump's rhetoric is Donald Trump's rhetoric. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=957.0400000000001s)]
*  He's the boy who cried wolf at this point. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=961.84s)]
*  We just have to be steady and stable and focus on what our agendas are. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=964.24s)]
*  And we're not really focusing on, you know, his social media posts at this point. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=968.24s)]
*  It's just kind of noise. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=972.34s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=974.0400000000001s)]
*  Reveals that India offers the best facility and talent for setting up such plants. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=977.84s)]
*  And India is sure that Apple will see profits over any pressure from the Trump government. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=983.14s)]
*  Sources further said that India will also explore other sectors, countries and players in the field. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=988.64s)]
*  My colleague Pallavi is with us on the phone line. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=998.34s)]
*  Pallavi, we know that Trump is transcending to a different level. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1001.24s)]
*  Now threatening Apple CEO Tim Cook. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1004.84s)]
*  Now what the Indian government is saying at this point? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1008.34s)]
*  See, first of all, of course, the Indian government is worried because Apple for now has opened two plants [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1011.84s)]
*  and Apple production in Indian plants have been really increasing and the productivity is also increased. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1017.0400000000001s)]
*  And it also, as we all know, generates a lot of employment and also sends out a message to other foreign investors [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1022.44s)]
*  that India is capable of and is being looked forward as an attractive destination for investment. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1027.94s)]
*  So Mr. Trump's comments, Donald Trump's comments, certainly he may have to set back. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1034.44s)]
*  However, government, top government sources are telling us that they are not too worried [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1038.24s)]
*  because the medical system is such where the business lobby is not going to work under pressure from the Trump administration. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1042.24s)]
*  At the end of the day, Tim Cook is a businessman. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1048.3400000000001s)]
*  He's going to look at his profit. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1052.64s)]
*  And India offers favorable options in terms of talent, in terms of infrastructure, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1054.24s)]
*  and also in terms of generation of the Apple phones and iPhones. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1060.84s)]
*  And it's going to work out to be cheaper for him. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1065.34s)]
*  A 25% trade tariff is huge. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1067.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't even as we speak, the commerce minister is there. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1069.9399999999998s)]
*  So there will be those backroom negotiations. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1072.54s)]
*  But we have been as a matter of tariff policy planning. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1074.9399999999998s)]
*  We have started, begun to explore newer destination alternatives as well. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1079.24s)]
*  But hope is not yet given up. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1083.34s)]
*  Many thanks. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1086.04s)]
*  Many thanks, Pallavi, for this update. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1086.6399999999999s)]
*  And then here, as I mentioned earlier, you'll see this is from the Indian Express. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1090.24s)]
*  Despite Trump's warning, Apple supplier Foxconn is moving ahead with its investment in India. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1095.3400000000001s)]

*  which is one of its subsidiaries. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1133.44s)]
*  This money is expected to fund a new display module manufacturing plant in Tamil Nadu, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1135.74s)]
*  which is a state already central to Apple's growing manufacturing presence in India. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1141.24s)]
*  While Trump's comments may have raised eyebrows, Indian officials aren't overly concerned. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1146.14s)]
*  A senior government official said supply chains don't reorient themselves overnight. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1151.8400000000001s)]
*  Companies like Apple make these decisions after months, sometimes years of planning. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1156.5400000000002s)]
*  One comment won't reverse a global strategy. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1161.74s)]
*  And that strategy clearly includes India. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1164.74s)]
*  Last October, the Tamil Nadu government approved a Rs 13,180 crore, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1167.4399999999998s)]
*  which roughly translates to $1.6 billion project by Yuzhan Technologies in Kanjapuram, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1172.9399999999998s)]
*  around 80 kilometers from Chennai. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1179.04s)]
*  Foxconn's new investment appears to be earmarked for that very plant. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1181.34s)]
*  Apple currently produces around 15% of its global iPhone output in India. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1186.1399999999999s)]
*  The company is targeting an ambitious 25% share in the coming years, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1191.24s)]
*  which is part of a broader shift to diversify its supply chain away from China. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1195.94s)]
*  I saw that in our last video, who appreciated us giving the perspective here. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1226.04s)]
*  And so I try to do that. I try to share the perspectives. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1232.24s)]
*  After really studying what's going on in the countries, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1235.3400000000001s)]
*  I try not to give it an American-centric oversimplification. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1238.94s)]
*  I try to really get deep and understand who the voices are to give our American audiences [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1243.54s)]
*  and also our international audiences that perspective. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1248.14s)]
*  And that's what I hope you saw that I've been bringing to our Canadian coverage, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKej9hVh3PU&t=1250.94s)]
