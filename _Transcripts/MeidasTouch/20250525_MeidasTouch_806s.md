# FURIOUS King Charles PUTS THE DAGGER in Trump IN CANADA
**MeidasTouch:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ)
*  Canada is still furious at the Trump regime and the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes, that doesn't just go away overnight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=5.2s)]
*  And one of the things that we're seeing take place in a major symbolic middle finger to Donald Trump, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=8.52s)]
*  King Charles will be giving a speech from the throne. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=15.92s)]
*  The first speech from the throne since 1977 to actually happen in Ottawa is going to be taking place. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=20.72s)]
*  Charles Tripp will mark the first time a British monarch has delivered the so-called speech from the throne since 1977, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=29.0s)]
*  a highly public show of support for Ottawa at a time when Donald Trump has continued to attack Canada. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=35.6s)]
*  And this says Canada is strengthening its relationships with the European Union, with the UK, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  as Australia is getting in there as well. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=51.12s)]
*  And the United States is getting more isolated by the day. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=53.92s)]
*  You're seeing Canadian universities seeing an opportunity as well to take the brain drain away from the United States. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=60.36s)]
*  And they're saying, you know, to the government, let's get more money to try to attract the top professors. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=69.12s)]
*  The United States is destroying their university system. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=74.84s)]
*  Let's try to attract the best and the brightest here in Canada. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=78.88000000000001s)]
*  And still a very scary moment for Canadians because you have hundreds of Canadian students are caught up in Donald Trump's recent attempt [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=82.84s)]
*  to treat all foreign students at Harvard University as basically undocumented migrants, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  which basically means, are you going to end up in South Sudan? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  Are you going to end up in a concentration camp in El Salvador? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=102.4s)]
*  Are they going to send you back to Canada? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=105.04s)]
*  But Canada has held its ground from day one. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=108.2s)]
*  They've been the beacon to the rest of the world in the boycott against the Trump regime, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  boycotting all American products, boycotting American tourism. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=117.92s)]
*  And they've really showed the way for Europe. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  They've showed the way for Australia and elsewhere. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=125.48s)]
*  I mean, I think right now tourism is down from Europe to the United States by 25 percent. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=127.64s)]
*  I think at least a twelve point five billion dollar hit right now to the U.S. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  tourism industry, although I think the number is going to be significantly higher than that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=139.32s)]
*  And this was a year that the U.S. tourism industry was expecting a lot of money to come in. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  This was a year that they were really kind of it's going to be a breakout tourism year in the United States. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=149.44s)]
*  All that tourism from Canada now is going to Mexico and elsewhere, skipping right over the United States. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=155.44s)]
*  You know, one of the interesting things to see, though, is a bipartisan delegation of Democrats and Republicans [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=162.72s)]
*  and a lot of people from border states like a mega Republican Senator Kramer from North Dakota [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=169.44s)]
*  going to Canada and basically saying, you know, please buy American, please take us back, because this is really stinging. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=175.4s)]
*  This is really hurting. And Canada is still pissed off and furious. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=183.84s)]
*  And as long as Donald Trump is still in power and he's doing his thing, you know, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=188.96s)]
*  I don't view what these delegations are doing as as having, you know, any of any effect other than to basically show [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=194.16s)]
*  that the boycotts are working anyway. Here's mega Republican Senator Kramer. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=203.16s)]
*  Let's play this clip. The reality is that Canada can go other places, but they'd bet they're better off working with the United States. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  Here we are, neighbors. You know, our provinces are darn near like states in my part of the world. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=215.48s)]
*  So I just think we all need to be talking. We need to be at the table. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=220.64s)]
*  We need to be encouraging one another. And I truly believe that that the healing has begun. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  Is that a message you're confident you can get to the White House, that you can relay what happened here to the president and make an impact? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=231.2s)]
*  Well, you're certainly help helping with that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=237.6s)]
*  But I think, you know, the other day, like I said, I was in the Oval Office for the Golden Dome announcement, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=240.72s)]
*  spent a lot of time with the president both on, you know, during the announcement and the news conference as well as afterwards. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=245.76s)]
*  He referenced Canada several times in that news conference as a partner, as somebody who's in a country interested in participating in Golden Dome. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=251.76s)]
*  It was done very respectfully, respectfully. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=259.76s)]
*  And I think with some affection, to be honest with you, I think some real enthusiasm. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=263.68s)]
*  So I think I think Donald Trump uses a lot of tactics and strategies. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=271.36s)]
*  A lot of what the bottom line is that Donald Trump has to beg Canada for this 500 billion dollar ridiculous Golden Dome because Canada is at the border. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=276.8s)]
*  You can't do it without Canada. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=287.52s)]
*  So can't you just see there what a this is the thing with Trump? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=289.36s)]
*  What a weak position he puts the United States where you got mega Republicans go in there and begging. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=293.84s)]
*  The whole thing is typical Trump week loser bill. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=299.76s)]
*  Let's bring in men, former member of parliament, Charlie Angus, who's on tour still. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=303.36s)]
*  You're going out there, you're speaking to the various communities in Canada. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=309.6s)]
*  And tell us, Charlie, people are still pissed in Canada. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=314.8s)]
*  This isn't just a forgive and forget. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=317.68s)]
*  I love this idea that the healing has begun with what? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=321.12s)]
*  Our prime minister went to Washington to meet with Donald Trump and what looked like some kind of, I don't know, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=326.72s)]
*  cheesy bordello with gold lambé, something he got from Putin. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=333.76s)]
*  And when they asked about being us giving up our sovereignty, he said, never say never. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=339.6s)]
*  Every Canadian knew what that meant because this man is a convicted felon and a sexual predator. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=349.6s)]
*  No means no means nothing to a sexual predator. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=354.8s)]
*  So here's a guy telling us never say never about the future of our country. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=357.76s)]
*  I've been in small towns across this country on a Monday night. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=362.24s)]
*  We will fill like the local theaters, like the whole town comes out. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=366.16s)]
*  People are determined to defend our democracy right now. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=370.8s)]
*  I think what's really surprising or interesting is that we have the mega Republicans coming to Ottawa [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=376.16s)]
*  and saying we all share things in common. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=382.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, we share some things in common, but there's other things where we're fundamentally different. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=384.48s)]
*  We are a democratic nation. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=389.92s)]
*  We believe in the rule of law. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=392.32000000000005s)]
*  The United States has allowed a man who attempted a coup to stay in power, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=394.16s)]
*  who the Supreme Court says is above and beyond the rule of law. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  That's what an oligarch does. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=406.16s)]
*  We were doing with my resistance team, we were sort of just trying to track how many times [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=408.72s)]
*  Donald Trump has said negative things about Vladimir Putin and how many negative things [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=414.64000000000004s)]
*  he said about Canada. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=418.64000000000004s)]
*  It's about a hundred to one. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=420.56s)]
*  His attacks on Canada, over a hundred. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=422.48s)]
*  His attacks are questioning Putin, almost minimal. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=425.52000000000004s)]
*  We are not sharing any same values right now. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=430.24s)]
*  The idea that maybe some like the Dakotas, yeah, they're getting hammered. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=434.8s)]
*  They're getting hammered because of the impact on cross-border ag trade. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, that's not our problem. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=446.8s)]
*  That's your problem. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=448.48s)]
*  You deal with the felon in charge from Mar-a-Lago, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=449.84s)]
*  and then we can talk about helping your farmers. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  But don't come across our border to our prime minister and say healing has begun. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  Healing begins when you start dealing with the criminal threat that's in Washington, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=461.84s)]
*  that's threatening the rule of law in Canada and around the world. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  Talk to us about this visit from the king, why it is a big deal. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=471.28s)]
*  If I accurately described it as a middle finger to the United States, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=476.48s)]
*  and if it's sending another message about an international alliance, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=480.96s)]
*  isolating the United States. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=488.32s)]
*  Well, if a prime minister had invited a king over to Canada to read the speech from the throne. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=492.0s)]
*  So the speech from the throne is the it's division statement. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=498.8s)]
*  When a new government comes in, when a government does a reset, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=502.4s)]
*  when there's a budget, that speech is not delivered by the prime minister, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=504.96s)]
*  it's delivered by the governor general. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=510.0s)]
*  And we love our governor generals. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=512.24s)]
*  They are the ones who represent the power of government in a symbolic sense. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=513.76s)]
*  But technically they are the representative of the king. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=519.6s)]
*  But we never talk about the king, the monarchy. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=525.04s)]
*  Most Canadians are completely indifferent to it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=527.76s)]
*  So the idea that we're asking the king to come over to do this [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=530.0s)]
*  if someone else had done this three years before, there'd be a huge outcry in the country. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=535.44s)]
*  But the symbolism of this is hugely important right now, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=540.4000000000001s)]
*  because what it's saying to the world is that Canada is part of the Commonwealth. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=544.0s)]
*  Our allies in New Zealand, Australia, who are still part of the Commonwealth, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=550.08s)]
*  we are looking much more now to the UK to start picking up their game, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=555.36s)]
*  because I think the UK hasn't really done all that much. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  The EU, we just saw really important statements from Prime Minister Carney [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=562.4s)]
*  with President Macron and Prime Minister Stammer calling out Netanyahu on the genocide in Gaza. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=568.24s)]
*  We would normally be going to Washington to talk about this. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=577.52s)]
*  We're not. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=581.36s)]
*  So the fact that the king is coming to open the new parliament [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  is sending a message that we're recalibrating. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=585.68s)]
*  We would normally not really want a king to come and hang out with us, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=589.2s)]
*  because we see ourselves as kind of post that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  But it also, I think a lot of Canadians are looking to it [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=596.32s)]
*  because they're saying to the UK, well, where are you guys? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  We were there on day one. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=604.0s)]
*  You know, while you guys were getting pulled off the beaches in Dunkirk, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=605.2800000000001s)]
*  Canadian soldiers were defending your borders. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=608.32s)]
*  We were there in the Battle of Britain. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=611.2s)]
*  We were there through all the fights against the fascists. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=612.6400000000001s)]
*  So this is a big symbol. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=615.36s)]
*  We also know how immature Donald is. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=617.52s)]
*  He really likes this king stuff. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=621.44s)]
*  So I think Prime Minister Carney is playing a smart role here. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=623.2s)]
*  And most Canadians are going to say right on, give this the thumbs up that the king is coming. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=627.52s)]
*  Finally, your message to Donald Trump. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=634.72s)]
*  We've been at this now, Charlie, you and I, for the better part of what since [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=637.04s)]
*  January, February, you and I had first met each other through the elections. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  And you and I have become friends through all of this. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=648.0s)]
*  And I definitely owe a visit to Canada. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=650.64s)]
*  I want to do some of that tour with you. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=653.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, lots of people are saying, hey, we want the Midas tour. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=655.5999999999999s)]
*  Ordinary people, I'm going to rallies are saying, when are the Midas crew coming? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=661.68s)]
*  So you owe it to Canadians because they're watching and they love [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=666.4799999999999s)]
*  the fact that you guys are nailing the gangster regime. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=671.0400000000001s)]
*  And that's what we're doing here in Canada. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=675.2s)]
*  Well, we'll definitely be there. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=677.2s)]
*  Charlie, what's your message right now? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=678.72s)]
*  We know Trump's team watches the Midas Touch Network. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=680.4000000000001s)]
*  They clip it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=683.84s)]
*  They show it to him. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=684.4000000000001s)]
*  What's your message to the Trump regime, Charlie Angus? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=685.2800000000001s)]
*  Well, Donald, when you've got a gangster regime that is so in line with what Vladimir Putin is [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=688.5600000000001s)]
*  doing, of course you hate us because we are a country of the rule of law. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=696.88s)]
*  We are a country of democracy. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=701.04s)]
*  Not a country that's going to support the rule of oligarchs over the common people. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=703.6s)]
*  That's your rule because that's the kind of criminal grifter that you are. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=708.48s)]
*  But if you think that Canada is going to bend or break, it's never going to happen. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=712.48s)]
*  I think our prime minister was dignified in dealing with you and that crappy gold [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=718.4s)]
*  Lamé Bordello that you've set up and called it an oval office. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=723.52s)]
*  You're not impressing anybody, Donald. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=727.1999999999999s)]
*  You are looking cheaper and weaker all the time. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=729.36s)]
*  And hey, we would welcome the boss any day and Taylor Swift to come to Canada. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=732.64s)]
*  But we know they really belong in the United States because they are the best of America, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=737.76s)]
*  while you are the worst of America. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=741.4399999999999s)]
*  But right now in Canada, we are feeling very strong. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=743.6s)]
*  We know we are going to take a lot of hits in this coming fight, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=748.16s)]
*  but we are a nation that is true. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  We are strong. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=753.5999999999999s)]
*  We are North and we are free and we will always be free. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=754.7199999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter what you and your grifter friends do, Donald. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=758.4s)]
*  Keep coming. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=762.0s)]
*  We will keep fighting. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=762.9599999999999s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=764.3199999999999s)]
*  Charlie Angus, former member of Parliament leading the resistance tour. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=766.8s)]
*  Although I think it's the people leading it with you, as you like to say, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=771.68s)]
*  it's a movement of the people of Canada. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=775.3599999999999s)]
*  Thanks, Charlie Angus. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=777.76s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=779.28s)]
*  Elbows up. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4C9chJDGQ&t=780.0s)]
