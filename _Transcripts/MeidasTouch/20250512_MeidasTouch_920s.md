# Trump gets BROKEN in Front of ENTIRE WORLD with RETREAT
**MeidasTouch:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk)
*  Pathetic, weak, and humiliating. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump was just broken before the entire world in his disastrous trade war with China, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=1.8800000000000001s)]
*  as Donald Trump pulled back most of the tariffs imposed on China after Donald Trump said that [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=8.44s)]
*  those tariffs were going to bring so much manufacturing back to the United States, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  and it was going to make the United States so rich that we wouldn't even need income taxes [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=18.28s)]
*  in the United States anymore because those tariffs would replace it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=23.64s)]
*  Donald Trump effectively surrendered as he was broken before the world. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=27.88s)]
*  If you want to see how China is viewing this, look at how its state regime media is talking about it today. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=31.88s)]
*  They are posting cartoon images like this of an Uncle Sam character getting uppercut in the face [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=37.6s)]
*  by a character representing tariffs. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=45.72s)]
*  More on that in a little bit. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=48.68s)]
*  What I want you to focus on as well, when you take a look at the joint statement [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  on U.S.-China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva released by the United States and China, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=55.04s)]
*  I want you to notice what's missing about that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=61.0s)]
*  Do you notice that it doesn't use the word deal, joint statement on deal? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=63.44s)]
*  Why? Because it was not a deal. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=68.4s)]
*  It was a retreat by Donald Trump after what he imposed on China. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=71.08s)]
*  China has referred to this as a consensus that was reached, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  and the consensus basically is for the United States to pull back what it did and what it said it was going to be so great. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  If you take a look at the details of what took place, it effectively means the U.S. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=89.04s)]
*  will temporarily lower its overall tariffs on Chinese goods from 145 percent to 30 percent, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=93.76s)]
*  while China will cut its levies on American imports from 125 percent to 10 percent, according to the joint statement. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=101.16s)]
*  Why? Because China recognized that tariffs are a tax on its own importers that are then passed through to consumers. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=109.0s)]
*  So China is effectively taxing its own consumers at a rate of 10 percent, while the United States is still taxing its consumers at 30 percent. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=117.44s)]
*  But the United States pulled back from 145 percent to 30 percent after a few days ago, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=126.4s)]
*  Donald Trump saying, I don't know, maybe we'll do 80 percent. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=132.76s)]
*  And then Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who some call Nutlick, said, I don't know, maybe it'll be 50 percent. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=136.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, now it is 30 percent right there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  And again, this is after Donald Trump said that this is what's going to make us all rich. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=146.2s)]
*  The more tariffs, the better, Trump said. Right. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=150.04s)]
*  And he said the fact that ships aren't coming into our ports, which we were warning about in the United States. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=152.92s)]
*  Right. We had Governor Gavin Newsom show up and say the ships aren't coming to Oakland. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=159.12s)]
*  The ships aren't coming to Long Beach, which is in Los Angeles. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=163.28s)]
*  We also know the ships were coming to Seattle. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=166.36s)]
*  But Trump said that was a great thing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=168.92s)]
*  So I guess that's not a great thing after all right there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=171.08s)]
*  And the markets seem to think that Trump's tariff war against the world is not a great thing because the markets are reacting very positively to Donald Trump's retreat right now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=176.04s)]
*  You want to see how it's being reported in financial papers. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=186.12s)]
*  Barron's, the financial magazine, says the following. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  Trump blinked big time on China trade, taking the worst case off the table. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=194.16s)]
*  The Trump administration has blinked big time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  And if you're saying, well, what did Donald Trump get in return? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely nothing. If you take Donald Trump's own words, he says that China said maybe it's going to try to maybe stop sending more fentanyl. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=204.83999999999997s)]
*  I take them at their word, he said. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=212.48s)]
*  I take them at their word that this may stop some of the fentanyl coming into the United States. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=214.2s)]
*  You take them at their word that that's what you extracted from this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  Take a look at how Bloomberg is characterizing this. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=223.0s)]
*  Xi Jinping's defiance pays off as Trump meets most Chinese trade demands. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  After two days of talks in Switzerland, the US and China announced de-escalation. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  The deal met nearly all of Beijing's core demands, including the suspension of the elevated reciprocal tariff, the establishment of a point person for talks. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=237.68s)]
*  And agreements on fentanyl and tariffs. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=248.44s)]
*  The reduction in tariffs is seen as a positive development in China, with the potential to boost its economy and make it easier to hit a growth target of about 5 percent this year. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=250.56s)]
*  Although some caution remains. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=260.52s)]
*  And it goes and talks about here in this article how China basically got everything it wants. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=262.76s)]
*  And so I ask you, what was the whole point of what Donald Trump's been doing if he was just going to withdraw it anyway after telling us all how great it was going to be? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=267.16s)]
*  And America gets what? Nothing in return. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=278.76000000000005s)]
*  There's no actual deal here. So stop calling it a deal. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  It's a consensus for the United States to retreat and for future discussions to happen in the future. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  That's what happened. And it showed the world how unstable the United States is. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=291.24s)]
*  And this is a horrible thing to say as an American, but I don't know. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  But I have to be objective in my reporting. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=301.0s)]
*  It made China look like the adult in the room and the mature one in the room, while Trump looked like a little petulant baby and shows the U.S. market as being not stable. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=303.56s)]
*  That's not a good thing right now. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=313.44s)]
*  And it also shows you can take Donald Trump. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=315.76s)]
*  We do this before, but it certainly is reflective, again, of you can take Donald Trump seriously on anything he says. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=318.08s)]
*  He'll impose something for 30 days. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=325.88s)]
*  The pressure rises and then he retreats. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=328.0s)]
*  That's his pattern over and over again. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  And the rest of the world has taken notice. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  He's a paper tiger is the nicest thing you could possibly say about him. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=334.79999999999995s)]
*  Charles Gasparino, a business reporter for Fox, says the following. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=339.12s)]
*  Trump raised tariffs on the world, the markets, particularly the bond market, which needs to finance our debt, rebelled. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=342.64s)]
*  Trump was then forced to back off. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=349.88s)]
*  End of story. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  Phil Matt 11, president trying to spin this as a victory. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  OK, sorry, I couldn't help myself. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=356.68s)]
*  But what we have seen is a little lesson in how markets exert their power. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=358.6s)]
*  How when you have to depend on them, as we still do, and remember, it's really the budget deficit that's causing the trade deficit and we need the budget deficit to maintain our standard of living. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=362.36s)]
*  You can't go to a trade war with the world without bad stuff happening. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=372.56s)]
*  Now I'll show you right here. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  This is by Donald Trump's own admission, kind of sheepishly being asked at a press conference earlier. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=378.56s)]
*  What did you get out of this? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=384.8s)]
*  So what's the United States getting? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=387.52s)]
*  Because there was more trade, better trade before January 20th. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=390.88s)]
*  So we're in a slightly worse position now than January 20th. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=397.2s)]
*  That's supposed to be the victory in terms of the bilateral relationship as a country. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=402.92s)]
*  We're in a far worse situation as we've had a first quarter GDP contraction. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=407.48s)]
*  Many small businesses and medium sized businesses suffering. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=412.92s)]
*  American people are suffering. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=416.36s)]
*  Donald Trump says, yeah, maybe they'll stop the fentanyl play this clip. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=417.88s)]
*  But so that's a very important subject to me, because everybody in this room has lost friends or people that have family members that have died of fentanyl. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=421.56s)]
*  So there's a big incentive for China to stop and I take them at their word. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=433.92s)]
*  They're going to work on that, I think, very hard. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=438.2s)]
*  So you ever wake up and feel like your body just hit the snooze button on life? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=440.32s)]
*  Yeah, same. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=444.16s)]
*  Honestly, aging sneaks up on you in some wild ways. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=445.0s)]
*  Whether it's a night out or a good workout, I just don't bounce back the way that I used to. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=447.88s)]
*  One day you're full of energy, the next you're Googling how to stretch without pulling a muscle. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=452.76s)]
*  I believe one of the best aging breakthroughs of the last decade is Qualiacin-Alytic. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=457.68s)]
*  And here's why. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=461.88s)]
*  It's designed to help your body naturally eliminate something called senescent cells, also known as zombie cells. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=463.04s)]
*  These are the ones that just hang around after they've stopped doing their job, draining your energy and making you feel, well, old. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=468.64s)]
*  Think joint discomfort, sluggish recovery, low energy, the whole deal. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=475.4s)]
*  Qualiacin-Alytic is a groundbreaking supplement made with nine plant-based nutrients, and you only take it two days a month. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=479.72s)]
*  That's it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=487.2s)]
*  Since I started taking it, I felt more energized, quicker to recover from workouts. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=488.08s)]
*  And honestly, just more like me again. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=492.08000000000004s)]
*  Plus, Qualia's breakthrough formulation is vegan, non-GMO, and tested by leading scientists. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=494.20000000000005s)]

*  Your older self will thank you. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=517.76s)]
*  And thanks to Qualia for sponsoring this episode. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=519.68s)]
*  China, we're working so well that we were going to eliminate the income tax, that we wouldn't need the income tax anymore. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=549.68s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=557.28s)]
*  We'll take care of that, but the tariffs, if people only understood the tariffs, we're going to be giving people of this country a tremendous tax cut. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=579.68s)]
*  And we're going to start with people making less than $200,000 a year. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=589.88s)]
*  So here's what we posted on the Mitis Touch Network. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=594.88s)]
*  U.S.-China agreed to a 90-day pause on new tariffs after shipping to U.S. ports plummeted. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=597.56s)]
*  U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports will be cut from 145% to 30%. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=603.3599999999999s)]
*  Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports will be cut from 125% to 10%. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=607.9599999999999s)]
*  If tariffs are supposed to result in massive job growth and make U.S. rich, then why are we lowering them? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=612.04s)]
*  Then we showed the cycle of Trump and MAGA people. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=618.0799999999999s)]
*  Trump goes, I'm adding tariffs. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=621.3199999999999s)]
*  MAGA people. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=622.92s)]
*  This will create jobs. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=623.88s)]
*  Trump, I'm removing tariffs. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=625.3199999999999s)]
*  Art of the deal, says his MAGA cult. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=627.12s)]
*  Trump, I'm adding the tariffs again. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=629.0799999999999s)]
*  Trump people, this will create jobs. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=631.12s)]
*  I'm removing the tariffs. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=633.0799999999999s)]
*  Trump people, art of the deal. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=634.12s)]
*  As Justin Wolfers, economist at University of Michigan, says, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=636.44s)]
*  there are two ways to frame this news. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=640.6400000000001s)]
*  U.S. trade policy and our macroeconomic prospects are much better today than they were yesterday. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=642.8800000000001s)]
*  And two, U.S. trade policy and our macroeconomic prospects are much worse today than on Inauguration Day. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=648.6800000000001s)]
*  Both are still true. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=656.1600000000001s)]
*  This is how they're talking about this in China Daily, the main Chinese state regime media. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=658.24s)]
*  I just want you to see how they're framing this there. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=664.0s)]
*  As a major power in the world, the U.S. should act in such a responsible way. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=667.0s)]
*  However, the frequent backsliding and wanton changes in trade rules of the government have damaged the country's credibility of itself. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=671.6s)]
*  The U.S. has become an unreliable and fickle player in global economic governance, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=678.8000000000001s)]
*  with its strategic credibility and international status being continuously eroded by its short-sighted behavior. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=683.24s)]
*  The U.S. is trying to curb China's economic development through high tariffs, but the reality is quite the opposite. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=690.04s)]
*  The global supply chain has formed an intricate network, and China has cultivated irreplaceable advantages in basic manufacturing, support industries and labor. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=696.12s)]
*  The high tariff will not only hit China, which in turn will seriously damage its own economic interests. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=705.36s)]
*  China will not succumb to any form of economic coercion and will resolutely defend its legitimate rights and interests, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=712.96s)]
*  and national security through corresponding countermeasures in accordance with relevant laws and regulations and the basic principles of international law. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=719.52s)]
*  It goes on to say. So you see what the position of China is right there. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=728.52s)]
*  And then while I'm on the topic, I do want to show you this as well, because you can go through deal by deal here with Donald Trump and we can call this out. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=734.0799999999999s)]
*  I think Justin Wolfers, economist at University of Michigan, does a very good job right here doing that. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=742.1999999999999s)]
*  Here he talks about how really, when you talk about the quote unquote deal between the United States and the United Kingdom, it's just a phony thing here. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=749.12s)]
*  Play this clip. Let me characterize the whole deal for you. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=758.5600000000001s)]
*  It's 10 percent. I want you to write that in big font on a big piece of paper. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=761.36s)]
*  Ten percent. There's a little asterisk next to it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=765.16s)]
*  The 10 percent matters because it basically said Trump walked in and he said, I am imposing a 10 percent tariff on Americans who buy goods from Britain no matter what. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=768.72s)]
*  And then he said, there's an asterisk up here which says, now let's start making a deal. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=778.3199999999999s)]
*  And the making a deal was a promise to have further chats about further conversations, which actually gets very close to nothing done. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=783.72s)]
*  It was basically collusion between the British prime minister and the American president to go out and each lie to their respective populations to pretend each had gotten something done with the other. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=790.76s)]
*  The reality is this deal does nothing except actually cement in place higher tariffs, to be clear, taxes on Americans who buy goods from from the United Kingdom per ren with a carve out for Rolls Royces. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=800.56s)]
*  And here, Professor Wolff first talks about how the economics of the special tar tariff carve out for British made luxury vehicles really reveals Donald Trump's true intentions here, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=814.16s)]
*  which is to basically help luxury brands that he likes, I guess, while manipulating the markets here play this clip right here. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=829.6s)]
*  And what's amazing is the president actually said, well, we've got to give him a break on the Rolls Royces because they're a beautifully made, handcrafted car. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=837.2s)]
*  The whole point of the tariffs is to bring production to America. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=847.0s)]
*  I get British craftsmanship, but if the president doesn't think we're capable of learning how to stretch leather over a car seat. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=851.5200000000001s)]
*  We have tariffs on bananas. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=861.6800000000001s)]
*  No American worker is ever going to learn how to grow bananas. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=865.2s)]
*  We have tariffs on vanilla. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=871.44s)]
*  We can't grow vanilla. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=873.9200000000001s)]
*  We have tariffs on diamonds. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=876.24s)]
*  We can't mine diamonds. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=878.4s)]
*  But we did decide that the one thing we definitely can't do is Rolls Royces. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=883.4399999999999s)]
*  So we should have a special carve out. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=889.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, there you have it, folks. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uIqlHbFWBk&t=892.0s)]
