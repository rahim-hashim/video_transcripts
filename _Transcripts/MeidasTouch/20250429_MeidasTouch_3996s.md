# LIVE: Dem Governor TOWN HALL on Trump 100 DAYS
**MeidasTouch:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk)
*  This is Ben Mycelis from the Midas Touch Network. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to the Democratic Governor's Virtual Town Hall live on the Midas Touch Network. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=5.0s)]
*  Tonight we will speak with four Democratic Governors from across the country about Donald [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=10.56s)]
*  Trump's first 100 days in office. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=16.36s)]
*  A disastrous 100 days. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=19.0s)]
*  And what these Governors are doing in their states to fight back and defend democracy [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=21.88s)]
*  from the clear and present threats that we face. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=27.04s)]
*  Let's meet the Governors. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=31.0s)]
*  We have with us tonight, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=32.44s)]
*  We have Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=37.28s)]
*  We have Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=39.4s)]
*  And we have New York Governor Kathy Hochul. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=42.36s)]
*  The Midas Touch Network viewers and subscribers to our sub stack submitted video questions [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=45.32s)]
*  to the Governors we will be showing shortly and asking them to respond. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=50.46s)]
*  But first I want to give each Governor starting with Governor Pritzker the opportunity to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=54.48s)]
*  make an opening remark to the American people. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=59.8s)]
*  Governor Pritzker what is your assessment of Trump's first 100 days in office and what [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  are you doing in response? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=68.44s)]
*  Well thanks Ben and I'm so excited to be especially with my friends the fellow Governors and with [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=71.28s)]
*  you Ben. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=76.16s)]
*  I think all of us are deeply deeply concerned about what's happening across the country [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=77.16s)]
*  and of course 100 days in it's been well a disastrous administration for the American [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=82.28s)]
*  people. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=87.92s)]
*  Essentially we've seen Donald Trump do exactly the opposite of what he said he was going [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=88.92s)]
*  to do and 100 days in we've seen prices go up. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=93.64s)]
*  We've seen you know it's hard to hard to buy a car hard to buy a house. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=97.16s)]
*  Your tomatoes lettuce and beer at the grocery store prices have gone up. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=102.4s)]
*  And of course when he promised that he was going to bring peace to Ukraine and around [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=108.2s)]
*  the world the opposite has happened. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=113.76s)]
*  There have been you know more attacks on our friends and our allies and more involvement [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  by the United States military across the world. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=122.36s)]
*  And then finally I just say that you know the rights of our friends and family our neighbors [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=126.08s)]
*  citizens across this great country are being taken away. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=135.32s)]
*  And I gave a speech on Saturday Sunday night talking about well in part about habeas corpus [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=140.04s)]
*  about the government doesn't have a right to just make you disappear or snatch you off [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=146.16s)]
*  the street without giving you the right to a hearing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=152.04s)]
*  And we're seeing that happening to legal residents of the United States and now we've seen it [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=155.78s)]
*  happen to US citizens. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=159.56s)]
*  So I'm deeply concerned about what the next 100 days and frankly the next 1000 days will [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=161.32s)]
*  be like. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=167.28s)]
*  Governor Walls your assessment of Trump's first 100 days and what are you doing in response. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=169.2s)]
*  Well yeah thank you Ben and to my fellow governors I couldn't be more proud than to be with this [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  folks that are that are taking that fight. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  Look I don't think any of us are surprised. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=181.12s)]
*  This is where Donald Trump ended up it's what he said and he is he's carrying those things [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=184.04s)]
*  out. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=188.0s)]
*  I think for us here in Minnesota my guidance to my team and to the administration and to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=189.32s)]
*  folks who care and that's a lot of folks taking to the streets we protect the most vulnerable [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=195.28s)]
*  and we protect our gains. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=200.04s)]
*  We have an opportunity to prove a different way of governing governing that improves lives [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=201.36s)]
*  whether that's providing food for children or making sure our folks are covered with [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=205.4s)]
*  health care and have access to free college and some help owning homes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=209.84s)]
*  Those are the things that people are looking for. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=214.52s)]
*  So look Trump is a disaster which we knew he would. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=216.28s)]
*  I think it gives us an opportunity and what you're seeing is people rising up and showing [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=218.96s)]
*  that there's a better way. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=224.08s)]
*  We can govern with compassion. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  We can govern with a sense of vision and innovation and we can govern effectively. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=226.88s)]
*  So I think here in Minnesota we're continuing to show that there's a better and a different [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=232.0s)]
*  way to do this. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=237.36s)]
*  We collaborate with these governors that are on with with me tonight and others across [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=238.36s)]
*  the country to ways that we can make sure that we're we're continuing to show as many [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=242.12s)]
*  people as that as possible. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  So this thing's going to get a little bit bumpy but I think you're seeing right now [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=248.68s)]
*  folks are turning out. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=253.28s)]
*  I do want to give a huge shout out to I got neighbors. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=254.28s)]
*  These these states are my neighbors but our Canadian neighbors they know that this is [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=257.72s)]
*  wrong. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  They stood up to it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  It provides a lot of momentum coming out of the Wisconsin special Supreme Court election [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  and I think the mobilization that's happening out there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  So it's 100 days of just crap. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=271.52s)]
*  We've got 500 plus till the midterms but the work has started. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=274.64s)]
*  Folks know that and I think they're they're looking to see folks stand in the breach and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  push back. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=283.36s)]
*  So I'm glad to be with you Ben. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=284.36s)]
*  I want to give a thank you to folks who took time out of your busy lives to tune in tonight. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=285.36s)]
*  We're all in this together and I'm just glad you're here. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=289.32s)]
*  Governor Healy what is your assessment of Trump's first 100 days and what are you doing [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=293.08s)]
*  in response? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=296.96s)]
*  Well Ben it's great to be with you and great to be with my my friends and colleagues on [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=297.96s)]
*  this. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=303.8s)]
*  You know I underscore everything said about the economy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=304.8s)]
*  The one thing that he ran on he has been an abysmal failure only making life more expensive [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=307.76000000000005s)]
*  more more difficult for residents for for businesses for our economy. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  I also just want to comment too you know I was attorney general for two terms I was attorney [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=320.6s)]
*  general during the Trump years and we brought hundreds of lawsuits and you know I can tell [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=325.72s)]
*  you that this administration is far worse than than what we saw with Trump won and I [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=330.88s)]
*  think that's evidenced by the past 100 days. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=337.56s)]
*  I mean what we've seen here in Massachusetts firing of doctors and nurses from our VA hospitals [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=340.4s)]
*  denying veterans care cuts to our research institutions which mean cuts to those who [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=348.35999999999996s)]
*  are currently right now involved in the process of discovering cures and treatments for ALS [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=356.12s)]
*  and Alzheimer's and and cancer. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=363.24s)]
*  We've had clinical trials with people on them shut down in Massachusetts because of Donald [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=366.0s)]
*  Trump's cuts to NIH. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=371.24s)]
*  I think about the tariffs in very real terms you know as governor my top priority has been [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=373.08s)]
*  building housing. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=378.16s)]
*  I filed and got passed a five billion dollar housing bill to build more housing in Massachusetts [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=379.16s)]
*  so we can lower costs. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=384.76s)]
*  And what does Donald Trump do? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=387.68s)]
*  He puts a tariff on the lumber that's coming in from Canada for that and the gypsum and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=389.32s)]
*  other materials that we need from Mexico to build that housing. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=394.76s)]
*  So making housing more difficult at a time a governor like me is trying to make housing [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  more abundant. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=405.08s)]
*  I cut taxes and you know every day he continues to do things that add to the inflationary [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=406.64s)]
*  pressures that are out there. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=412.36s)]
*  I heard him earlier tonight and once again he lied. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=414.36s)]
*  Eggs are still over six dollars a dozen and and that's just where we are. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=417.68s)]
*  And you know I think one thing that's also I'll end with this last comment. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=422.76s)]
*  You know Massachusetts we're home to a lot of colleges and universities. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=427.92s)]
*  We have about 100,000 students that come here from around the world to study to do research. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=430.48s)]
*  Some of them pioneer new treatments win Nobel prizes. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=435.36s)]
*  A lot of them are entrepreneurs. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=439.16s)]
*  They start businesses, start companies that take off and flourish not just in Massachusetts [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=441.36s)]
*  but around this country. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  And with Donald Trump's terrible job that he's done to scare foreign students away. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=448.16s)]
*  It was just revealed tonight the illegal efforts of DHS around the student visas. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=456.16s)]
*  You know we have people who have packed up who have left because they're scared. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  And with that goes talent. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=466.04s)]
*  I'll also tell you the one who's winning in all of this China because right now China [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=467.04s)]
*  is on our campuses recruiting our scientists and faculty and saying hey Donald Trump is [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=471.16s)]
*  cutting your funding but you come to China and we'll set you up with a nice lab and plenty [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=477.56s)]
*  of staff and I guess it'll be in China that we're going to see those inventions and entrepreneurship [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=481.68s)]
*  and growth. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=486.56s)]
*  So we just got to keep speaking up and playing offense talking about calling him out for [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=487.56s)]
*  the things that he's doing that are causing so much harm and then continuing to talk about [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=493.08000000000004s)]
*  the things that we governors are doing in our states that make our states more competitive, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=497.16s)]
*  safer where there's greater opportunity and I think all of us have have records to show [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=502.72s)]
*  that I'm proud of Massachusetts because right now we're number one in education, health [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=507.08000000000004s)]
*  care and innovation. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=510.36s)]
*  My colleagues will rib me on that probably challenge me but the point is we as democratic [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=512.12s)]
*  governors know how important those investments are in science and in kids and education, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=517.28s)]
*  workforce and the like. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=523.44s)]
*  Governor Hogan, your assessment of Trump's first 100 days and what you're doing in response. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=526.4s)]
*  Nice commercial from Massachusetts by the way Governor, well done. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=531.04s)]
*  I'm glad you like that. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=533.8s)]
*  Good to see my friends once again and Ben thanks for hosting this important conversation. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=534.8s)]
*  The first 100 days, is that all it's been? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  It feels like every passing day we're finding another way that Donald Trump is turning the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=543.56s)]
*  American dream into a nightmare and I can't, the stream of broken promises that many people [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=547.16s)]
*  in our country believed in him. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=553.92s)]
*  It's just extraordinary and I've never seen in all my life and I've been involved in elective [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  office for 31 years the way that he is weaponizing the American government against its own people [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=560.9599999999999s)]
*  and let's just dissect some of these things that he's done. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=567.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean you talk about the tariffs, who are they helping? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=570.52s)]
*  Who are the winners in this? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=574.4399999999999s)]
*  Seems to me we're all going to be losers because the only ones getting jobs in this era are [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=576.36s)]
*  bankruptcy lawyers and we're starting to hear even effects like toy manufacturers are cutting [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=580.68s)]
*  back production. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=585.9399999999999s)]
*  Stores that normally do their holiday purchasing. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=587.8s)]
*  This time of year my mom had a small flowering gift shop. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=589.7399999999999s)]
*  We were buying our things in the spring for the next Christmas. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=592.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure Santa Claus is coming this year at the rate we're going because the cost is [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=595.5999999999999s)]
*  so high we're going to be driving businesses out of work and out of business and the cost [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=600.52s)]
*  in New York is estimated about $7 billion, a loss of 280,000 jobs. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=604.8399999999999s)]
*  Now this is also going to cost families in New York over $6,000 a person if these Trump [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=610.12s)]
*  tariffs, which I call the Trump tax, stay into effect. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=616.16s)]
*  So at the same time what are we doing? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=619.8s)]
*  I'm fighting back. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=621.72s)]
*  We're going to court. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=622.72s)]
*  It's also a growth industry for all lawyers. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=624.6s)]
*  My attorney general Tish James has been teaming up with the attorney generals from all across [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=626.72s)]
*  the country. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=630.72s)]
*  Today I think we're filing a lawsuit to stop what they're trying to do, destroying our [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=631.72s)]
*  offshore wind industry. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=636.08s)]
*  I know it's important to my New England friends as well. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=637.48s)]
*  Trying to stop the tariffs and litigation, trying to stop everything they're doing, the [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=640.76s)]
*  cutbacks, the $300 million we lost that's supposed to help build back communities after [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=644.44s)]
*  natural disasters. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=649.0s)]
*  Our people are hurting. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=651.64s)]
*  Not to mention the farmers. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=653.96s)]
*  It's not just Wall Street that's hurting in my state, it's also the main streets and the [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=654.96s)]
*  small towns and the farmers who cannot believe that their costs went up $10,000 a month to [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=658.88s)]
*  get more fertilizer and their feed that they normally get from Canada. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=664.36s)]
*  So I have a whole litany of parade of horribles, but my concern is that the people of my state [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=667.72s)]
*  are hurting. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=673.5600000000001s)]
*  They're hurting all over America and we're going to keep going to court and standing [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=674.5600000000001s)]
*  up. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=677.9200000000001s)]
*  But the next thing we can do best is to organize, take this anxiety and this anger and turn [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=678.9200000000001s)]
*  it into action. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=683.4000000000001s)]
*  Action means we're mobilizing already for 2026. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=685.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm proud to be leading that effort in the state of New York to help take back the Congress [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=688.36s)]
*  because if we can finally get a firewall and stop at least part of this insanity, at least [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=692.48s)]
*  we got hope again. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=696.96s)]
*  And that's what I'm focused on these days as well. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=697.96s)]
*  Thank you, governors, for your opening remarks. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=701.0400000000001s)]
*  Now let's move on to the video questions submitted by our audience here at the Midas Touch Network [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=703.36s)]
*  for this town hall. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=709.12s)]
*  Let's start with Governor Pritzker. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=710.12s)]
*  This was submitted by Breanne. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=712.2s)]
*  She has a question about protecting protesters and mass mobilization. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=713.96s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=719.0s)]
*  Hello, my name is Breanne Washington. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=720.0s)]
*  I'm here in central Florida, unfortunately a red state right now. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=722.16s)]
*  But I'm curious to see if there have been any plans, specific plans from the governors [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=728.28s)]
*  on how you might bolster or encourage your constituents, those individuals who are putting [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=734.84s)]
*  up the fight, resisting, protesting at this particular time. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=742.92s)]
*  What sorts of steps are you planning to take that will help these individuals, these citizens [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=747.68s)]
*  and residents of your individual states? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=754.52s)]
*  Governor Pritzker. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=757.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=758.9599999999999s)]
*  And I have to say, one of our obligations as governors is to keep the peace when people [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=760.88s)]
*  are protesting. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=766.92s)]
*  But I have to say people are mobilizing on their own and we are seeing peaceful protest [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=767.92s)]
*  all across the country. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=774.1999999999999s)]
*  Especially in Illinois, I want to give you an example. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=775.48s)]
*  There's a young woman down in Edwardsville. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=778.8000000000001s)]
*  It's a southern Illinois town. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=781.4000000000001s)]
*  About 28,000 people live in Edwardsville. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=783.08s)]
*  Andy Smith is her name. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=785.96s)]
*  And she went out with a sign and stood at the intersection of two highways that are [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=787.32s)]
*  nearby just by herself. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=793.44s)]
*  She was so frustrated in early February about what Trump was doing. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=795.88s)]
*  And she just held up a sign to express herself. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=800.08s)]
*  Somebody that was walking by with her dog saw her, walked over and joined her in the [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=804.6800000000001s)]
*  protest. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=810.08s)]
*  And then the next day she showed up and four friends showed up to protest with her. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=811.08s)]
*  And then two days later, more people joined her. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=816.76s)]
*  And now every Friday at one o'clock, 300 people show up to protest with her. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=819.6400000000001s)]
*  That's just because one person was willing to go out there. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=826.6s)]
*  She felt a little crazy. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=829.8000000000001s)]
*  She said the first time that she was out there by herself. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=831.48s)]
*  But now she's got friends and people that she never knew who are showing up and expressing [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=834.52s)]
*  themselves. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=839.84s)]
*  That's happening in, you know, that's only 300 people in Edwardsville. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=840.84s)]
*  But think about that all across the state of Illinois, where most of our state is rural [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=845.52s)]
*  and ex-urban. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=850.84s)]
*  But of course, in the city of Chicago, and people are activated and they're motivated. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=852.84s)]
*  They're getting out there. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=857.2s)]
*  And of course, we're protecting them. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=858.2s)]
*  I have been encouraging them. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=860.12s)]
*  In fact, I believe that we all ought to be mobilizing. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=861.36s)]
*  It's the best way for us to get across what we really believe is that, you know, show [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=864.6800000000001s)]
*  up at your Republican congressman's office and let them know, quit shutting down veterans [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=870.12s)]
*  services, quit taking away Social Security and Medicaid. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=875.72s)]
*  And we know that's what they're about to do. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=879.24s)]
*  They deny it. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=881.44s)]
*  But this summer, in fact, over the next few weeks, we're going to see them start to articulate [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=882.72s)]
*  why they're going to take away Medicaid in my state from 770,000 people. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=887.92s)]
*  But it's millions across the United States, people who might die because they don't have [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=892.96s)]
*  health care because Republicans took it away from them. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=899.04s)]
*  Governor Walz, the next question is for you. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=902.4s)]
*  And it's about Medicaid and Medicare in your state. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=904.56s)]
*  And it's submitted by Deanna, who lives in your state. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=908.12s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=911.24s)]
*  Hello. And thank you, Myas Tutch. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=912.76s)]
*  And thank you for your time, governors. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=914.64s)]
*  My name is Deanna from U.S. House Minnesota District 7, Moorhead. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=917.12s)]
*  Please, I have a question for Governor Walz. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=922.52s)]
*  I'm a disabled single mom. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=925.08s)]
*  My 13 year old son is on the spectrum and has epilepsy. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=927.4s)]
*  Matter of fact, he has specialist appointments at Gillette on the 30th. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=930.76s)]
*  He needs his Medicaid. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=935.8s)]
*  I need my Medicare Part D and secondary miniature coverage. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=937.44s)]
*  With these essential programs on the chopping block to budget for and fund the tax cuts for [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=942.5600000000001s)]
*  the wealthy, does Minnesota have any contingency plans for those of us who need our [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=947.36s)]
*  Medicaid? I welcome responses from the other governors for their states as well. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=952.0400000000001s)]
*  Thank you. Governor Walz. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=956.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, thank you, Deanna. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=959.28s)]
*  Thanks for being on here. And in Minnesota, we do take care of our own. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=960.76s)]
*  And I think we're getting out there. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=964.36s)]
*  We've been doing a lot of town halls around the state, letting people understand exactly [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=966.28s)]
*  what Medicaid and Medicare does for them. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=971.12s)]
*  Forty percent of all children in this state, they'll rely on Medicaid. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=974.64s)]
*  Eighty percent of our seniors in long term care and nursing homes depend on it, especially [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=978.8s)]
*  in and Deanna is right up there across from Fargo when you get out into the more rural [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=983.16s)]
*  areas. And so in Minnesota, we make it a top priority. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=988.72s)]
*  We have one of the highest rates of folks that are insured, but it's dependent on the [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=992.12s)]
*  federal government's share of this. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=996.24s)]
*  And I think you've got a district that Deanna is speaking from that you have a member of [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=997.88s)]
*  Congress who is unwilling to meet with their constituents. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1001.72s)]
*  We were up in Moorhead a week ago and a town hall with state legislators and myself making [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1004.64s)]
*  sure that our neighbors know exactly what's going to happen here. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1010.72s)]
*  We have gone out of our way to make sure that we get people insured because one, it improves [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1013.36s)]
*  people's lives. Two is in the long run, we end up saving money and it's stronger for our [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1017.4s)]
*  economy, making sure our children are fed, making sure our children are covered, making [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1022.08s)]
*  sure our children are getting tax cuts to their families to get the things that they need. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1026.1200000000001s)]
*  But I can tell you this, it doesn't matter which of these states and you're going to hear [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1030.24s)]
*  from two states with New York and Illinois that are very large, but economy of scale [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1034.2800000000002s)]
*  doesn't help you when they take the Medicaid away from you. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1038.44s)]
*  It will have devastating impacts. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1041.48s)]
*  It will have devastating impacts on people like Deanna's son. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1043.3200000000002s)]
*  And you couple that with the destruction of the Department of Education that takes away our [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1046.44s)]
*  civil protections around students with disabilities and IDEA. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1050.88s)]
*  And you have a situation where the secretary of health basically said it and was speaking [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1055.3600000000001s)]
*  with the language of eugenics that some people just don't matter. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1060.72s)]
*  People like Deanna's son or my son or those of you listening tonight. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1064.24s)]
*  So, look, this is a fight we must win. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1068.44s)]
*  It's a fight that the American people are overwhelmingly on our side, but we need to get out [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1071.0800000000002s)]
*  and make the message of how important this is. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1076.0s)]
*  Don't let them message this that somehow Medicaid is a giveaway program. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1078.64s)]
*  It is foundational to everything we do. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1083.92s)]
*  Next question is for Governor Healey. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1087.0800000000002s)]
*  This question is about democracy and civil rights and the steps you're taking to defend [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1089.1200000000001s)]
*  our courts. Let's play this clip. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1094.8000000000002s)]
*  Hello, I'm Michael from Northern Virginia. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1100.4s)]
*  Over the past 100 days, we've watched an administration openly test the limits of [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1103.2800000000002s)]
*  constitutional authority, attack independent institutions and promote an agenda that [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1107.44s)]
*  undermines basic democratic norms. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1112.72s)]
*  The threats we're facing are not theoretical. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1116.04s)]
*  They're here and they're escalating. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1118.48s)]
*  Given this moment, what specific steps are you taking individually and collectively to [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1121.2s)]
*  safeguard voting rights, protect the independence of states and the courts and defend civil [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1126.68s)]
*  liberties against federal overreach? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1132.16s)]
*  And briefly, I'd also like to acknowledge Congressman Jerry Connolly, who recently [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1134.8400000000001s)]
*  announced his retirement. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1138.92s)]
*  His service reminds us how important principled leadership is, especially at a time like [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1140.48s)]
*  this. Thank you for your leadership and your example. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1144.44s)]
*  We're ready to stand with you in defending our democracy. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1147.4s)]
*  Governor Healey. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1150.96s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Michael. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1152.0800000000002s)]
*  And Michael, just so you know, Congressman Connolly's sister is a state court judge right [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1153.3200000000002s)]
*  here in our Commonwealth, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1159.2800000000002s)]
*  I'll tell you what I'm doing. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1163.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm supporting my attorney general. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1164.16s)]
*  You know, I know the work that the attorney generals did in Trump one was so important. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1165.6000000000001s)]
*  We were successful over 85 percent of those cases. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1171.24s)]
*  And this group of AGs is having the same success and right there holding him accountable in [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1174.0s)]
*  the court. So, you know, I think as a governor, that that is something that I'm going to [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1180.48s)]
*  continue to absolutely to support the work of the attorneys general who represent in our [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1184.2800000000002s)]
*  instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in court, bringing cases, holding onto the [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1188.56s)]
*  rule of law and pursuing justice in the courts. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1194.56s)]
*  The other thing I'm going to do is to do my job as Governor Michael. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1198.32s)]
*  You know, Massachusetts, we have laws here that protect people's access to health care, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1201.32s)]
*  protect women when they need access to an abortion, that make sure that kids with [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1206.04s)]
*  disabilities are treated equally and fairly. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1210.48s)]
*  We have laws and policies on our books that make sure that kids are fed. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1213.6799999999998s)]
*  I copy Coach Walls and and free school lunch and breakfast in Massachusetts. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1217.92s)]
*  We have strong supports, housing programs, health care programs, programs for our seniors. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1223.28s)]
*  We passed, I think, the country's best veterans legislation in and just recently. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1228.44s)]
*  And we continue to support and enforce that and support our veterans. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1235.24s)]
*  So, you know, I'm going to do all I can within my power, Michael. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1239.48s)]
*  And this is why governors matter, because we're on the front lines right now. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1243.68s)]
*  We've got laws that we want to implement and enforce here in our states. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1247.1200000000001s)]
*  We want to make sure that people's rights are protected. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1251.04s)]
*  And we also do that working with one another, other states and working with our state AGs. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1254.52s)]
*  These are these are really important things that we need to do. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1261.48s)]
*  I'm also speaking up and using this platform to talk about what's happening when they [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1264.0s)]
*  disappear, people from our streets without cause, when they scare away our foreign [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1267.96s)]
*  students, were illegally take away their visas to study in this country when all they want to do is [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1274.72s)]
*  studying and and research and invent new technologies and pioneer new cures. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1281.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's outrageous what came out today. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1286.92s)]
*  So part of my job, Michael, is to to use this platform so that we can explain to the [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1289.28s)]
*  American public what is going on real time in our states. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1294.3600000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump takes this action. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1298.4s)]
*  Here's the consequence in our state. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1300.16s)]
*  And I'm going to continue to do that. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1302.48s)]
*  And I will say to you, because you're from Virginia, we just kicked off celebrations of [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1303.8s)]
*  250 years of this country. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1309.72s)]
*  The revolution kicked off here in Massachusetts with the shots fired and conquered in [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1311.8s)]
*  Lexington and people joined up and down from all of the then colonies to form this amazing, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1315.56s)]
*  amazing unit and the union in this great United States of America. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1320.84s)]
*  And all of us in power are going to work our damnedest every single day to preserve that and [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1324.44s)]
*  to further that. And that's the job of those of us in office and the job of all citizens in [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1329.2s)]
*  America. The next question is for Governor Hokel. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1333.48s)]
*  And this question is about Trump's disastrous tariffs and his harming our economy. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1337.0s)]
*  Let's play this clip. Hello, Democratic governors and my Discussion Network. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1342.76s)]
*  My name is Jesse. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1349.28s)]
*  And here's my question. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1351.04s)]
*  Trump's implementation and strategy of his tariffs has been unstable and aberrant, to [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1352.96s)]
*  say the least. How do you assess the short term and long term economic impacts of said [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1358.72s)]
*  tariffs? And what should we do as people here in the U.S.? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1366.6000000000001s)]
*  What should we do to prepare and how should we prepare for this? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1372.24s)]
*  Because it's going to hurt. Thank you for answering my question. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1375.96s)]
*  Governor Hokel. You know, Jesse, a place like South Carolina where you're from really relied on [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1379.8s)]
*  textiles and just like New York State, upstate New York, we've had manufacturing since the very [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1385.0s)]
*  beginning along the Erie Canal. It opened up commerce to the rest of the world. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1389.8799999999999s)]
*  And now it is so painful to see that as we've transitioned from the traditional [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1393.72s)]
*  manufacturing, the smokestacks manufacturing where my grandpa and dad worked in the steel plants in [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1398.1999999999998s)]
*  Buffalo, we've now converted into an innovation economy. And so we don't have those opportunities [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1403.32s)]
*  anymore. But Donald Trump seems to think that we're going to overnight bring back all those jobs [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1408.84s)]
*  and everybody's going to want to work in those type of factories once again, not realizing our [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1413.48s)]
*  country has moved on. Yes, we need to do more manufacturing here, but it's going to take so long, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1417.8s)]
*  so long for that to happen. He seems very conscious of the fact that he's going to cause [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1422.84s)]
*  short term and long term pain to the American people and doesn't care because he's so committed [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1427.24s)]
*  to this concept that tariffs across the world are the answer for everything. Outside of the [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1432.28s)]
*  effects right here in New York State, we are on the board with Canada. We share a board with [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1437.24s)]
*  Ontario and with Quebec. They're our largest trading partner. You know what has stopped right [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1442.68s)]
*  now? Trading. They don't want to send their products here and our farmers and growers and [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1447.24s)]
*  people who rely on this opportunity to trade with Canada are just being stifled. They're not going [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1453.0s)]
*  to expand their facilities. They're not going to hire more people. They're stagmired right now [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1457.24s)]
*  in a situation where they don't know what's going to happen because of the instability. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1461.88s)]
*  I wish I could give you a better answer. I've got statistics that'll just blow your socks off in [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1465.72s)]
*  terms of how many people's jobs will be lost in one state alone because of these painful tariffs, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1470.28s)]
*  these taxes. But most importantly to me, what it's doing to the average family. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1475.3999999999999s)]
*  And when their grocery bills are going to go up despite Donald Trump's campaign promise over and [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1480.36s)]
*  over and over that on day one prices would go down and instead they've gone up exponentially, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1485.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't know how we can get away with that. So we're suffering. Our people are suffering. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1492.92s)]
*  Our businesses are suffering. Our tourism industry is going to be flat on its back if [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1497.8s)]
*  we don't change this because the Canadians who spend a lot of money in our country go to our [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1503.32s)]
*  little restaurants and our hotels and our attractions and go to Buffalo Bills games and [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1507.6399999999999s)]
*  go to Sabres games where I'm from. They're not coming because they're so angry at us for going [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1512.36s)]
*  to war with one of our best friends in the world. So it's not just the tariffs, the talk of tariffs, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1517.3999999999999s)]
*  it's also the relationships that are forever severed at least at this point. We have to start [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1522.04s)]
*  rebuilding trust. And so here's the answer. We have to mobilize and people like yourself, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1526.12s)]
*  do not think you are alone. There are people all over America who want to stand together. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1532.9199999999998s)]
*  And you know where you go to? I guarantee you have a lot of Republican congressional offices [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1537.0s)]
*  in your state, right? Guarantee it. I do as well. We have seven in New York. Go to their offices. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1540.84s)]
*  Don't make it easy on them to stand blindly with Donald Trump and not feel the consequences of it. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1547.08s)]
*  They must know that they've supported in Donald Trump's policies that they're hurting the people [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1552.52s)]
*  who put them in office. I'm a former member of Congress. I served at a time when the Tea Party [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1556.92s)]
*  was just running wild. They used to come and protest my town halls. It was hard. But you know [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1562.44s)]
*  what? I stood there and took it. These people are too chicken because they know they're on the wrong [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1567.96s)]
*  side of history here. But get out there with your friends, start writing letters, start sending the [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1572.6s)]
*  emails, start filling up their phone banks and just blasting them because when they start filling [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1577.0s)]
*  enough pressure that they may not get re-elected again, that's the power of the people that started [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1582.36s)]
*  way back when our country rebelled against a dictator and rebelled against a king. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1588.04s)]
*  Donald Trump called himself a king when he shut down something called congestion pricing in New [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1592.9199999999998s)]
*  York. Called himself a king. Said long live the king. You can't make this up. He did that. But I [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1597.8s)]
*  said we have not labored on our king for over 250 years and we're not about to stand for that now. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1605.0s)]
*  So Jesse, you and the same sentiment as millions of us, we have to rally together, stand together, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1611.16s)]
*  mobilize, organize and get out there and vote next year to take back our country, at least the House [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1617.24s)]
*  and the Senate. Back to Governor Pritzker. This question, Governor, is from April H. She's from [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1622.0400000000002s)]
*  Chicago and her question is about affordable housing and jobs. Let's play the clip. I am a resident [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1629.16s)]
*  of Chicago and I have a specific question. As much as families now are losing hope as all of [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1636.6799999999998s)]
*  the pricing gets worse and it doesn't really seem like anything is happening to the president after [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1647.08s)]
*  all of his lies and all of the lawlessness he has done, we begin to wonder what specific steps our [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1655.7199999999998s)]
*  Illinois governor is taking to ensure that our working families in our state can afford housing. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1665.0s)]
*  My, even my rent went up and it's getting un-affordable. You know what we're doing for [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1671.64s)]
*  housing and health care and education, not just now but to help us all in the long term. I have [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1677.0s)]
*  a son who's getting ready to graduate law school with over a hundred thousand dollars in debt [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1684.52s)]
*  who can't even seem to find a good job, let alone move out and have affordable housing. Thank you. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1692.68s)]
*  Governor Pritzker. Well, first of all, April, I'm sorry for the challenges that you're going through [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1702.92s)]
*  and I, when I listen to you, I think, you know, as a state we've made an enormous amount of progress [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1711.48s)]
*  toward addressing housing. In fact, I, as you may know, I put together a commission last year that [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1718.12s)]
*  came up with a bunch of really great ideas for us to follow through on and we're doing that this year [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1724.04s)]
*  in the legislature. We've put a lot of money toward our Department of Housing and there's so much [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1730.4399999999998s)]
*  more that we can do. You know, you heard Governor Healy talk about how the cost of building housing [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1737.32s)]
*  has gone up and it really has. And of course, although under President Biden, inflation started [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1744.28s)]
*  coming down, which allowed the Fed to consider bringing down the cost of, you know, borrowing [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1752.84s)]
*  so that you could borrow money to take out a mortgage to build a house. But Trump came in [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1761.8799999999999s)]
*  and he's reversed all that because of the damage that he's done to the economy and the [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1769.24s)]
*  increase in prices, the Fed is likely not to lower interest rates now. So we have real problems when [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1776.84s)]
*  it comes to addressing this outside the state that are affecting the state. But in the state [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1785.0s)]
*  of Illinois, again, we're putting policies in place that are increasing housing. But I want to [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1790.2s)]
*  address the broader question that you were talking about, which is, you know, housing is a point of [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1796.2s)]
*  stability in somebody's life that allows, for example, people to survive and thrive. Without it, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1802.3600000000001s)]
*  people who have medical challenges aren't able to find the stability that they need to recover from [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1811.8s)]
*  those challenges. So housing is probably the very first and foremost thing that we ought to be [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1818.8400000000001s)]
*  addressing. So what did I do in Illinois? We put Home Illinois in place to make sure that people [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1824.52s)]
*  who are unhoused can begin the process of moving toward not just shelter, but first temporary [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1830.12s)]
*  housing and then permanent housing. We in fact put more money toward that program than we've ever [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1837.08s)]
*  done before. We're seeing in places like Rockford where we've finally gotten to functional zero [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1843.0s)]
*  homelessness. And that's what we're trying to do across this entire state of Illinois. So look, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1849.8799999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump is making everything harder. Housing, rent, being able to borrow money to buy your first [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1856.36s)]
*  home or any home. And that's something that we're all going to have to live with until we're able to [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1862.52s)]
*  overturn the Congress. And that, in fact, is one of the things I want to say to everybody that's [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1869.08s)]
*  listening. If you're not out there protesting in front of a Republican congressman's office, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1874.76s)]
*  or out in the street making your voice heard, or calling your friends in another state to have them [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1880.92s)]
*  do it, or showing up in Washington, D.C. in front of their offices, those Republican congressmen, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1886.8400000000001s)]
*  then you're not doing what's necessary to put pressure on them to vote the right way. This [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1893.24s)]
*  summer they're going to be voting on a budget. And we're going to see the consequences of that [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1899.8s)]
*  budget. What are they trying to do? They're trying to lower taxes for the wealthiest people [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1904.9199999999998s)]
*  by raising taxes on you. Those tariffs, those are taxes that are put on working class, middle class [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1909.96s)]
*  people across the United States. And if we don't stop them, they're going to make things harder [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1916.68s)]
*  and harder for the very people that we as Democrats and all of our Democratic governors are trying to [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1922.44s)]
*  protect. And that's the working families of America. Next question is for Governor Walz. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1927.4s)]
*  This question is about mental health and mental health of our troops and veterans as well. Let's [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1933.24s)]
*  play this clip. Hi, my name is Danielle. I'm from Louisiana. I am an Air Force veteran. And my [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1938.76s)]
*  question for the governors is how you all are protecting our troops and their mental health [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1947.24s)]
*  and well-being, especially during this crazy time with this regime, all the attacks on DEI, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1957.96s)]
*  just all of it, especially for troops from different minorities, different genders. This [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1964.2s)]
*  has got to be really tough and you can't be political when you're in the military. So are [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1971.16s)]
*  you as governors putting forth any policies or programs to help protect the mental health of [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1975.96s)]
*  our troops, if nothing else, at a National Guard level per your jurisdiction per state? Thank you. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1982.04s)]
*  Governor Walz. Yeah. Well, thank you, Danielle. Thank you for the service and thank you for the [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1991.48s)]
*  courage to come on. And look, troops are just not supposed to be partisan, but you can be political. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=1995.32s)]
*  You need to be. It's a responsibility to tell what's going on. And with Donald Trump, I can [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2002.44s)]
*  assure you of this. There is no care for our troops. There never has been, whether it's [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2007.0s)]
*  disrespect of troops or whether it's the inability to fund the things that are most important for [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2011.3200000000002s)]
*  the troops. On this one, it's personal for me, both having served, but also being the ranking [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2016.04s)]
*  member on the House Veterans Affairs Committee that prior to Donald Trump being there, whether [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2020.76s)]
*  it was under George Bush or Barack Obama, when I served in that position, there was bipartisan [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2025.0800000000002s)]
*  support, things like the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act, where we came together to [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2030.04s)]
*  reduce suicides and saw the work being done both when our troops were in uniform and after they [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2034.36s)]
*  left, understanding that those wounds of war run deep and are not always so obvious. Those days [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2040.36s)]
*  are coming and much more difficult. The cuts that Donald Trump is making, 84,000 of our providers [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2048.12s)]
*  at the best healthcare system in the world, which is the VA, a promise that we made to troops that [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2054.84s)]
*  if you serve us, we will serve you in your healthcare, becoming much more difficult to [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2060.6000000000004s)]
*  be able to provide all the services that are necessary. And this is not about running a [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2065.32s)]
*  business. The VA trains 70% of the physicians in this country and it provides care to well over a [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2069.96s)]
*  million veterans. And it is the best care in the world. The mental health piece of this, we know [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2076.6800000000003s)]
*  that getting access to that care in a timely manner, understanding that we're going to have [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2081.72s)]
*  to, when these troops come home, we've got a lifelong commitment to make this happen. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2086.2799999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump is continuously trying to underfund. And I will just say this, this is a fight I have [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2090.04s)]
*  been fighting almost two decades now, is the attempt to privatize the VA. This goes back to [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2095.16s)]
*  our current Secretary of Defense, ran an organization called Concerned Veterans of America. Its purpose [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2103.9599999999996s)]
*  was to undermine the VA and privatize the VA and shift that money out of that. And what that ends [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2109.56s)]
*  up doing is leaving veterans without care. And that's why we get so many veterans, if they can [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2115.08s)]
*  get into the system, we can prevent the mental health issues. We can help heal. We can be part [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2120.7599999999998s)]
*  of a broader community. And I will also say this, many of our veterans depend not just on the VA, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2125.4s)]
*  they depend on Medicaid as a part of this. So all of these things fit together. The education pieces [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2131.32s)]
*  that are being pulled back to be able to make sure that our veterans get the training they need [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2136.68s)]
*  to live the careers post-military. So the assault that Donald Trump has made on this, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2140.7599999999998s)]
*  I won't stand for it. If he wants to stand in front of troops, he wants to wave the flag, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2146.2s)]
*  he doesn't do a damn thing for veterans. He has undermined their care. He's put them at risk. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2151.0s)]
*  And I want to just say this, trying to get people out of the military because of who they are [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2155.3999999999996s)]
*  and who they authentically are of someone who has had the courage to sign up where Donald Trump did [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2161.48s)]
*  not or to put our troops at risk, our female troops at risk have the right to make their own [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2166.52s)]
*  reproductive decisions. And we have a right to make sure they have access to that care. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2172.84s)]
*  So this is a fight that I'm glad folks are on. Danielle showed courage to speak up, which she [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2176.92s)]
*  has the right to do. But those of us who aren't in the military now have a responsibility to make [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2184.2s)]
*  sure that we're pushing for this issue. So I'm grateful for the question. I'm grateful for the [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2189.4s)]
*  work that's being done. And we need to call out anytime Donald Trump mentions anything about [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2193.72s)]
*  patriotism, the military or veterans, he's a damn liar. And he has not delivered on those promises. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2199.9599999999996s)]
*  Next question is for Governor Healey. This question is about female veterans and equal [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2206.3599999999997s)]
*  employment opportunities for female veterans. And generally speaking, let's play the clip. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2211.0s)]
*  Hello, my name is Emma. I am a United States Army veteran. And under the current administration's [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2216.52s)]
*  policies, I and thousands of other women like me are considered persona non grata in the job [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2222.44s)]
*  market. My question to you all is what steps are you going to take to ensure an equal chance [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2229.2400000000002s)]
*  for female veterans to get employment? Emma, thank you so much for your service. And I come [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2238.44s)]
*  from a military family. So proud of our military and those who serve our veterans, our service [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2248.28s)]
*  members, our Gold Star families who paid the ultimate price. You know, the military has [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2255.6400000000003s)]
*  become stronger over time because it embraced diversity, you know, desegregated the troops way [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2264.0400000000004s)]
*  back, that allowed women. In fact, I'll tell you this, Emma, the woman who actually was the pioneer [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2271.88s)]
*  and made possible women in the Army is a woman named Edith Norris Rogers. She actually served [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2278.28s)]
*  in the United States Congress for Massachusetts. And a few months ago, I've lost track of time, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2284.92s)]
*  as Governor Hoco says, I don't know how many days it's been. The same day that Donald Trump [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2291.48s)]
*  had the Department of Defense and Arlington National Cemetery take down on their websites, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2297.5600000000004s)]
*  all the images of women, of Black people, of Latinos, of Asians. Remember that day? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2303.0s)]
*  We had a celebration of Edith Norris Rogers in the State House. And I put on display all the [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2309.48s)]
*  uniforms that women had worn in combat over the years. Diversity is a strength. It's not a flaw. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2316.84s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense for us in classrooms, in boardrooms, in C-suites, or in the military [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2325.24s)]
*  to exclude women, people of color, people with disabilities. It's wrong. It doesn't make for [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2332.92s)]
*  better outcomes, doesn't make for better results. So as Governor, you know, I've convened with my [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2339.16s)]
*  veteran secretary, we have a targeted effort in our state to fund and support programs for women [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2344.7599999999998s)]
*  veterans in particular, because of some of the added burdens that they've endured, particularly [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2352.84s)]
*  around PTSD. But we do that for all of our veterans. But I just want you to know that, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2358.44s)]
*  you know, if you were in a state like Massachusetts, you'd have the benefit of our [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2363.08s)]
*  HERO Act, which benefits 30,000 women in Massachusetts. We also have a deputy secretary [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2367.6400000000003s)]
*  who's a woman in that position at Veterans Affairs here in Massachusetts. And, you know, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2375.2400000000002s)]
*  I say this to you, Emma, as somebody, look, I was the first gay person elected attorney general in [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2381.48s)]
*  the country when I got elected, and I'm the first woman elected governor in the state of Massachusetts. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2386.52s)]
*  And I wouldn't be where I am today if we didn't have anti-discrimination laws in place. I'll tell [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2391.64s)]
*  you that. And, you know, that's why we need to really push back hard on what Donald Trump and [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2397.3199999999997s)]
*  his administration is doing in trying to write diversity out. Again, diversity is a strength, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2402.68s)]
*  not a flaw in America. Next question is for Governor Hockel. This question's from John S. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2410.2s)]
*  from Massapequa, New York. It's about Medicaid and maternal care. Let's play this clip. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2416.52s)]
*  Good evening, governors. My name is John Saznik, and I'm a pediatrician and neonatologist from [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2423.0s)]
*  Massapequa, New York. As you probably know, Medicaid currently covers nearly 40% of all births [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2427.48s)]
*  nationwide and is essential for ensuring access to prenatal, neonatal, and pediatric care. With [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2432.7599999999998s)]
*  significant cuts to Medicaid expansion increasingly likely, I'm deeply concerned about [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2438.52s)]
*  the millions, including pregnant women, infants, children, and families, who could lose coverage. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2442.6s)]
*  How are your states preparing to protect these populations and maintain access to critical [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2448.44s)]
*  health care services if federal Medicaid funding is reduced? Governor. John is New York state's [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2452.2s)]
*  first mom governor. Maternal care is everything to me. And I will tell you this, we are the first [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2459.16s)]
*  state in the nation, I'm really proud of this, to require that insurance companies, all insurance [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2465.24s)]
*  companies, not just for people on Medicaid, that they provide paid prenatal care so you don't get [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2469.9599999999996s)]
*  a situation where a mother, as I've met them, had to make a choice between her minimum wage job as [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2476.52s)]
*  a waitress and leaving that job for a few hours to go to a prenatal appointment to take care of her [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2481.3999999999996s)]
*  baby's health and her health and possibly risking money to bring home to her other kids at the end [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2486.4399999999996s)]
*  of the day. We didn't think that was a fair choice for people to make, and I hope other states will [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2491.48s)]
*  follow what we did here. We're proud of our focus on moms and their health and their babies' health, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2495.64s)]
*  and we do have pockets where maternal mortality and infant mortality is very high, especially among [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2501.08s)]
*  women of color. And we've gone into those communities and supported programs for doulas and [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2506.44s)]
*  made sure that there's doula directories, and this is covered by insurance as well, focusing on not [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2511.08s)]
*  just the mom's health but with the baby afterward, and so we cover moms and babies on Medicaid even [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2516.84s)]
*  for the first year after the birth. So we're laser-focused on this in New York. You ask a [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2522.1200000000003s)]
*  different question, though. You're asking what happens when Donald Trump's cuts come or the [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2527.56s)]
*  Republican cuts come, and I anticipate there'll be more cuts when they work on the reconciliation [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2532.2000000000003s)]
*  bill later this summer. We need to hold them accountable. Every single one of them, probably [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2537.6400000000003s)]
*  many of them, are moms and dads themselves. These Republican members of Congress who need to know [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2542.28s)]
*  the outrage of their residents, and out on Long Island you have a number. You have two Republicans, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2546.84s)]
*  and I will give you their addresses to go down and ask them what they're doing to protect Medicaid, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2552.28s)]
*  especially for our most vulnerable moms in their hours of pregnancy, the months of pregnancy, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2557.0s)]
*  and brand new babies. We're focused on putting money back in families' pockets. I just got through [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2562.1200000000003s)]
*  an arduous effort to get our budget done, almost 100% finished, and it's focused on families. We'll [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2568.6800000000003s)]
*  have child care tax credits for the first time ever, $1,000 for every family with a child four [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2574.52s)]
*  years old and under, because I know personally that's when you have to pay for the diapers and [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2580.2000000000003s)]
*  the formula, and always going for those medical checkups and the vaccinations, and yes, get your [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2585.1600000000003s)]
*  vaccinations. So we're putting money back in families' pockets. We have a middle-class tax cut [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2589.7200000000003s)]
*  coming, the largest tax rate cut in 70 years. We have money and inflation rebate, putting money [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2595.0s)]
*  back in families' pockets, starting as soon as possible, and we're focusing on nutrition [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2600.84s)]
*  programs, making sure we cover all the lunches and breakfasts in school, just like some of my [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2606.12s)]
*  colleagues do. So it's all about the family to me. As I said back when I first announced my budget [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2610.6s)]
*  this year, I said, your family is my fight. Now, I didn't know at that moment that that fight would [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2616.2s)]
*  also include taking on Donald Trump and his administration, who's trying to undermine all [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2620.84s)]
*  these safety net programs like Medicaid for expectant families. So I appreciate your concern. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2625.6400000000003s)]
*  We are on this, and if something does happen, our Attorney General, Tish James and I will be on the [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2631.0s)]
*  front lines to try to stop it in court. We can't always rely on the courts, but sometimes we're [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2635.8s)]
*  surprised. Even the Supreme Court, handpicked by Donald Trump, the majority of them, have sometimes [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2640.76s)]
*  done the right thing in the interest of protecting the separation of powers and ultimately protecting [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2646.36s)]
*  our democracy. So this fight is my own, and you can count on me being on the front lines if this [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2651.1600000000003s)]
*  happens. Next question is going to be directed to all four governors who are here with us tonight, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2656.36s)]
*  and it's about your communication strategy. What are Democrats doing to communicate all of the [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2662.1200000000003s)]
*  great policies and ideas that you've talked about so people actually get it and elections are won? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2668.2000000000003s)]
*  Let me play this question from Henry for all of you. Let's play it. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2675.24s)]
*  Thanks for taking my question. My question is really about how to package the party going forward [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2678.6s)]
*  for both the midterm elections and the 2028 presidential election, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2684.68s)]
*  because something like 90 deals in 90 days is pretty ridiculous, but it catches people's [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2689.16s)]
*  attention. And a lot of what Trump is doing with the way he's approaching things is very much [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2696.12s)]
*  catching people's attention, even if there's really no substance to it. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2702.2s)]
*  But what can the Democrats do to be better in terms of reaching people that are more likely [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2706.4399999999996s)]
*  to relate to TMZ than they are to relate to the New York Times? Great question. Governor Pritzker. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2712.52s)]
*  Well, let's start with we've got to speak plainly to the American people about what really matters, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2721.72s)]
*  the things that I think in the hearts of all four of us about standing up for working families, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2727.88s)]
*  about being the party that fights for the middle class and for the working class and for the most [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2733.48s)]
*  vulnerable in our country. And we've got to make sure that people understand what we're doing to [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2739.56s)]
*  get things done. Every one of the four governors on here have accomplished really important things [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2745.48s)]
*  So I'll give you an example in my state. You know, there's a federal minimum wage, $7.25. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2752.3599999999997s)]
*  Nobody can live on $7.25 anymore. It's $14,000 a year if you're working full time. You've got to [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2758.2799999999997s)]
*  work two to three jobs to take care of your family at $7.25. It's impossible. So in my state, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2764.68s)]
*  we raised the minimum wage to $15. It was important to us to make sure that we're lifting people out [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2774.52s)]
*  of poverty. If you're going to work full time, you ought to get a wage that's appropriate to that, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2780.36s)]
*  that you can live on. So that's something that we ought to be talking about federally. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2785.8s)]
*  The $7.25 minimum wage, not enough. And Democrats are for raising it. Republicans [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2791.32s)]
*  don't want to raise it. In fact, many of them would like to do away with the minimum wage. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2797.8s)]
*  So we should be speaking plainly about raising wages. We should be speaking plainly about the [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2802.36s)]
*  fact that we are for universal health care. Every one of us believes that health care is a right, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2807.0s)]
*  not a privilege. And we can have disagreements about how you get there. Some say Medicare for all. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2813.64s)]
*  Some say that we ought to expand private insurance to cover more people with a state subsidy, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2820.52s)]
*  for example, or a federal subsidy. But whatever that is, we believe that everybody should have [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2827.64s)]
*  a doctor and that no one should go without. Republicans are trying to take away, you're about [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2833.56s)]
*  to see this, they're trying to take away Medicaid and Medicare from people who need it most. So I [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2839.16s)]
*  believe that the way to communicate is to start with the simple messages of the things that we [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2845.64s)]
*  believe that are reflective of our values. And then we've got to choose the media where messages [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2851.56s)]
*  are really getting to people. And this is one example of it. We're on here today because this [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2859.0s)]
*  is one of the great outlets, one of the great channels that really reaches people. So many [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2864.12s)]
*  people listen to Ben. And going on, and I saw this with Tim Walz when he was running for vice president. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2869.4s)]
*  He went on just about every kind of podcast that you could possibly go on. He was everywhere. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2876.92s)]
*  We've got to do that, all of us, and make sure that the democratic message of standing up for [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2884.2s)]
*  working families is heard everywhere and directly to people who are online and listening. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2889.0s)]
*  Same question to you, Governor Walz. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2896.92s)]
*  Yeah. Well, Henry, thanks for the question. And I'm, look, you've got these three governors myself. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2899.56s)]
*  I'm partial towards governors. I'll just say that they're out there, but we need everybody on the [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2905.24s)]
*  field. We need everybody out there filling a lane and taking a message. Donald Trump understands [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2909.56s)]
*  this. He sucks up so much oxygen. He's the 800 pound gorilla in the room. And the debate that's [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2915.08s)]
*  happening right now, could a hundred people defeat a gorilla? I'd like to find out with a hundred of [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2919.7999999999997s)]
*  us to get out there and fill these lanes. Tell them what we're doing. Show them a difference. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2925.56s)]
*  Show them the fight that people are ready to lead. And we need to be alongside of them. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2930.2s)]
*  And then when we gain power, I think this is really critical. These governors you have on here, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2935.48s)]
*  I'm going to go with what Governor Pritzker said. These are consequential governors that have [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2940.1200000000003s)]
*  passed important legislation, not to get themselves reelected. They did it to improve lives. And this [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2945.5600000000004s)]
*  idea that when you win an election, don't bank that political capital, burn it as quickly as [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2951.4s)]
*  possible. And I will tell you, someone asked me if I've learned anything from Donald Trump. I learned [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2956.6800000000003s)]
*  this. We need to move as aggressively and as fast as Donald Trump has moved with our progressive [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2960.76s)]
*  policies. We need to expand healthcare. We need to make access to it more affordable. We need to [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2968.0400000000004s)]
*  make sure education is more affordable. We need to make housing more affordable, not talk about it, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2973.4s)]
*  not to have a better idea than them. The thing that governors do, they actually implement it [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2978.1200000000003s)]
*  and get it in. So I think now if someone's lane is to do their own podcast, do the podcast. If [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2983.5600000000004s)]
*  somebody's lane is to do large rallies, we see Bernie Sanders and AOC out there. We see Chris [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2989.24s)]
*  Murphy out there. Governors, Andy Beshear, this group here, everybody out there and state house [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=2994.52s)]
*  members, I see it doing it too, flood the zone, talk about what can be improved, make it clear [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3000.2799999999997s)]
*  that he's failing. They know that. But tell them what we're going to do. And I would just tell all [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3006.52s)]
*  of us when we win and this thing starts, when we hold the governor in New Jersey and when we win [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3011.64s)]
*  back the governorship in Virginia, Donald Trump becomes a lame duck and we run as fast and as hard [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3018.84s)]
*  as we can. And we win, start putting the plans together. In January of 27, we need to be passing [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3025.0s)]
*  legislation that improves people's lives. As he's recklessly tearing things down, we need to [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3031.56s)]
*  aggressively build them up. So Henry's on the right spot. I want to thank my fellow governors who are [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3037.96s)]
*  on here tonight and they're right. This is one way of doing it, but everybody's finding their niche [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3042.6000000000004s)]
*  and we're the 100 gorillas and I'll bet on us against him on this one. Governor Healy, same [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3048.6s)]
*  question for you. All right. Thank you, Coach Walz. You know, I agree with everything that my [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3054.2s)]
*  colleagues have to say. And, you know, I'll just add to it. You know, I was really moved hearing [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3060.92s)]
*  from Deanna earlier in the night. I was raised by a single mom and she went back to work, became a [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3067.08s)]
*  school nurse to take care of us. You know, we've got to get out and fight for people. And we've [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3072.84s)]
*  got to make it clear to people the things that Donald Trump is doing. Here's the action, here's [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3080.84s)]
*  the consequence. And we need to continue to stand up to him and to speak out against what he is [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3085.96s)]
*  doing when he's doing things that hurt people, that hurt our economy, tank our economy, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3090.6000000000004s)]
*  are illegal and unconstitutional. I think that is really important right now. I'm not sure that [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3096.6000000000004s)]
*  people who voted for Donald Trump voted to have their dad not be able to get care at the VA [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3101.88s)]
*  because they laid off all the doctors. And I'm not sure that people voted for Donald Trump to [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3108.6s)]
*  fire all the scientists and the people who are trying to cure cancer right now. They certainly, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3114.76s)]
*  I think, didn't vote for him to raise prices, right, and raise costs. Nobody wants that. But [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3120.12s)]
*  that's what's happening. So we both need to be really clear about that and then show the contrast. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3126.68s)]
*  Here's what we're for. You know, all of us, the four of us and our colleagues, we want to fund [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3134.2799999999997s)]
*  education. We want people to have health care. We want people to be able to afford a house. We want [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3139.72s)]
*  people to be able to go to school if they want and then get a job and have a career and growth. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3145.24s)]
*  We don't want moms like Deanna struggling. And by the way, not everybody is in a position to go to [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3152.44s)]
*  those town halls or go to those congressional offices because moms like Deanna got to take care [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3158.36s)]
*  of her son. So everybody's got to find that lane and step up and fill that role. An example of what [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3163.4s)]
*  I'm talking about when I say draw the contrast, I cut taxes in Massachusetts. I'm the first governor [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3170.68s)]
*  in 20 years to do that. This spring, because I wanted people to understand and feel that impact, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3175.64s)]
*  I did a whole road show and I focused on showing up in places where parents were, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3181.72s)]
*  where seniors were, because among the things we did is we provided the country's most generous [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3186.4399999999996s)]
*  tax credit for families with kids or dependents at home. And I wanted people to know as they were [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3192.2s)]
*  doing their taxes, they had the benefit of that. I went to all these senior centers because I wanted [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3197.8799999999997s)]
*  them to know that we doubled the amount that they're going to get back in a refund this year. And [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3201.8799999999997s)]
*  I think every time we take actions, whether it's stockpiling Miffl-Pristone or [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3207.96s)]
*  streamlining permitting so that we can bring more clean energy on and modernize the grid, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3213.4s)]
*  we got to be out there telling people, showing people what we're doing and how it impacts their [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3218.2799999999997s)]
*  life in real ways. And I know that with that, Democrats are going to have success because I [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3223.64s)]
*  know what we believe in. I know what we fight for and I know who we fight for. Governor Hockel, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3230.52s)]
*  same question for you. All right. The answer is not simple because we've heard it all from all [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3237.32s)]
*  my friends here. I also think, yeah, we talk about different platforms of communication. We all know [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3241.56s)]
*  how to go on cable news. We're invited all the time and that's great. But how do you amplify [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3247.6400000000003s)]
*  beyond that the people are not watching MSNBC or CNN? And the answer is you do have to be creative [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3252.2000000000003s)]
*  and have, I would say surround yourself with young people and ask them where they're getting [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3257.96s)]
*  their news from. We know most people are getting their news from Facebook. They're getting their [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3262.44s)]
*  news from TikTok. And it's not always gone through the rigors of a 60 minute interview where you [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3265.8s)]
*  have to know exactly all the facts or else you should be called out on it because facts sometimes [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3272.84s)]
*  are collateral damage to this war on truth that we have right now. But that being said, go to the [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3276.92s)]
*  places that aren't always comfortable for us as leaders of our party and of our states and to [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3282.84s)]
*  meet people where they are. So have a robust, robust social media communications strategy, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3287.5600000000004s)]
*  the traditional and not so traditional, they knew an emerging ways to connect with people. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3295.0s)]
*  But as you've heard from my friends, you can't sit behind your desk. You know, we do have loud [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3299.08s)]
*  platforms. I have the New York City media market. There's nothing more challenging, but also more [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3303.88s)]
*  expansive. And that gives me an opportunity as I'm going out there and I'm literally on the road show. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3308.36s)]
*  I was in a childcare center this morning telling the parents about how I'm giving them more money [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3313.08s)]
*  for childcare because I knew what it was like when I had to leave my job with Senator Moynihan as a [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3317.24s)]
*  young woman because there was no childcare. So that reminds me all the time of being more [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3321.8s)]
*  relatable to people. We all have our own life's experiences. And I tell him, I never forget the [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3326.36s)]
*  people who are still in the trailer park that my parents used to live in when they first started [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3331.96s)]
*  married life. They're still there. I still go to the diner in that neighborhood and talk to people. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3336.36s)]
*  And I go by the old steel plan and think about the people that feel like they're abandoned because of [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3341.1600000000003s)]
*  their jobs being shipped overseas or elsewhere. So use your own stories and connect with people [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3346.2000000000003s)]
*  don't talk down to people. We don't need any more policies or plans or prescriptions for success. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3352.2000000000003s)]
*  We don't need a 20 point plan on how to make people feel that they've got more money back in [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3357.48s)]
*  their pocket. Be more relatable. Let them understand empathy and emotion are important to convey as [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3362.6800000000003s)]
*  well. So we're not just by the book Democrats. Yeah, we know better than everybody else. We don't. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3368.6000000000004s)]
*  We're always learning and we learn more by reaching out of our comfort zone and going into the spaces [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3373.4s)]
*  like when I got elected in the most Republican district in the entire state of New York a few [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3378.36s)]
*  years ago during the Tea Party revolution, I went to the diners. I went to one diner. This one man [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3382.76s)]
*  said, not only have I never voted for a Democrat, I've never even seen a Democrat. So I went to those [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3388.36s)]
*  places uncountable, but eventually you can win people over. You slap them on the back. You find [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3394.52s)]
*  a shared experience. Oh, my grandparents came from Ireland. Their family were dairy farmers. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3398.44s)]
*  So there is a way that we need to be more relatable and stop talking down to people. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3403.08s)]
*  Let them know we understand them, but find the different ways that people are reaching out [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3407.72s)]
*  because the message we have for 2026 and 2028, it has to fit on a bumper sticker. Not to make [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3411.3199999999997s)]
*  America great again. We know that was a disaster, but it wasn't a disaster marketing-wise. You know [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3418.2s)]
*  what I'm saying? Everybody knew what that meant. We need to distill our message as the one that's [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3422.8399999999997s)]
*  bringing hope to bringing back our country and fighting for the working class as you've heard from [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3427.16s)]
*  my colleagues. So we've got the answers. It's how we convey them is what is going to be our next [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3431.48s)]
*  challenge and we'll get it right. And this town hall live stream is currently number one in the [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3437.08s)]
*  United States on YouTube as we're streaming this live. All right. Time for brief closing remarks [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3443.0s)]
*  right now from the governors. So as we wrap up this town hall, we're going to ask the governors [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3449.16s)]
*  to give their closing remarks on Trump's 100 days and where we go from here. Governor JB Pritzker, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3453.88s)]
*  your closing remarks and message to the American people in Trump's first 100 days. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3461.56s)]
*  Let's start with it's time to fight. Everybody has to get up, stand up, speak out, show up. And if you [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3467.08s)]
*  can't go somewhere to do that, well go online and make sure you're speaking up and showing up online. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3475.72s)]
*  And if you can't do that, how about calling your congressperson, your senator to make your voice [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3481.88s)]
*  heard? Everybody has got to stand up for not only what's best for themselves and their families, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3487.4s)]
*  but also their neighbors and their friends. And I'm seeing that. Here's the thing that I want to say to [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3494.84s)]
*  everybody. You should have a lot of hope because I'm seeing Republicans and Democrats showing up [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3500.6800000000003s)]
*  to make their voices heard, to stand up for veterans who've lost their services, to stand up for [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3506.6800000000003s)]
*  those who are receiving social security but whose social security offices are closing. And so they've [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3511.8s)]
*  got to show up in order to get their social security check. Medicaid is under attack and I think [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3519.0s)]
*  everybody understands that if you're not on Medicaid, someone you know needs medical care and they [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3526.36s)]
*  rely upon Medicaid. And I'm seeing families show up for other families. I'm seeing veterans show up [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3533.24s)]
*  for each other and many of us who come from a military family are showing up for our veterans [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3539.48s)]
*  as well. So I want to say this is a moment when we have an opportunity to really stand up for each [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3545.96s)]
*  other. It's who we are as Americans. It's what we ought to be doing. And as much as I am challenged [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3553.0s)]
*  and all of us are by what Donald Trump and his gang in the White House are doing, I also see that the [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3561.96s)]
*  American people are standing up and getting the job done of making their voices heard. We're going [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3569.2400000000002s)]
*  to see a real momentum over the next few months and over the next year. And by November of 2026, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3574.84s)]
*  we're going to take the Congress back because of everyone listening to this podcast and Americans [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3581.48s)]
*  all across the country. Governor Walz, your closing remarks and your message to the American people. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3587.08s)]
*  Well, Ben, thank you. Thanks, Midas, for touching the network and to my fellow governors. I'm so proud [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3593.0s)]
*  to stand with you. Look, let's get a couple ground rules first. You can't appease authoritarianism. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3597.8s)]
*  Call out their crap and just know that that's who they are. Stand proud on our progressive values. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3603.08s)]
*  Stand proud that we're feeding children. Stand proud that we care about the environment. Stand [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3609.4s)]
*  proud and get out there and don't try and find an easy way to this. This is a way that we have to [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3613.16s)]
*  have policies that improve people's lives and then find a lane. Find your lane, everybody who's out [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3618.12s)]
*  there, whatever it is. If you're good at something, do that. If you'd rather do something else, get [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3623.72s)]
*  there. I will associate myself as we were colleagues together, Governor Hockel and I [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3628.2799999999997s)]
*  show up at those things. It makes a difference. Call their offices. They work for you. Make them [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3633.8799999999997s)]
*  work for you. And I'm telling you, it's working. We've had some of us have shown up in Omaha. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3638.68s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of folks stopping through that beautiful blue dot. Don't anybody diss [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3643.3199999999997s)]
*  Nebraska? They turn out in Omaha. They've got a GOP congressman in a district that is ours and [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3647.16s)]
*  should be won. You know what's happening to him now? He thinks maybe we shouldn't cut Medicaid. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3653.24s)]
*  This weekend he was talking about he might want to spend more time with his family instead of [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3657.88s)]
*  running again. That's a good idea. We need to keep the pressure on every single one of these. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3661.48s)]
*  I thank you for doing this. I thank folks who tuned in. This is our fight. It's our time. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3667.0s)]
*  Nobody's going to come riding in here. It's just the folks. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3671.6400000000003s)]
*  Governor Healy, your closing remarks and your final message to the American people. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3679.6400000000003s)]
*  Thanks, Ben. And thanks for having us on. And thank you, everybody who tuned in. I too want [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3684.12s)]
*  people to leave here tonight with hope. I see people speaking up every day. I see people standing [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3691.0s)]
*  up every day around this country as more and more people are realizing the pain and the consequence [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3696.3599999999997s)]
*  of Donald Trump and what he is doing. And I just encourage people to continue to stay at it. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3703.3199999999997s)]
*  Understand that this is going to be a marathon. It's going to take some time. And we just got to [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3710.36s)]
*  stay at it every single day. Basketball, I was a basketball player. Basketball is big in my [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3719.56s)]
*  background. It's team sport. Everybody's got a role to play. And there's something about basketball [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3723.96s)]
*  where you got to play offense and you got to play defense. And as a point guard, if I stood up, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3729.08s)]
*  you'd see I'm only 5'4". It's about making plays, right? And it's about the assist. And everybody's [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3733.16s)]
*  got a way to participate in what we need to do right now as a country. So get out there, get [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3739.72s)]
*  after it, continue to talk to people, share experiences. I think that's really important. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3747.16s)]
*  On social media, if you see somebody posting something and you think it's a good telling of [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3753.72s)]
*  something that's going on, then share that because the voices, elected leaders matter, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3758.2s)]
*  politicians matter. But every day Americans matter more. They always have. They always had. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3764.52s)]
*  And I was reminded of that when I stood and conquered for the 250th celebrations when that [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3771.48s)]
*  ragtag band of farmers and tradespeople and other colonists faced out a mighty, mighty [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3775.96s)]
*  British army and king. And at the end of the day, we know what happened there. So [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3783.0s)]
*  continue on with the work. And I look forward to being able to work with many of you and talk [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3790.04s)]
*  with many of you over the coming weeks, months, and years. Thank you for what you do. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3794.8399999999997s)]
*  HOFFMAN Thank you, Ben. And I'm always inspired when I hear my fellow governors, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3799.48s)]
*  and these are just a small sampling. I believe that this is the new leadership that our country [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3807.88s)]
*  needs is among the ranks of our governors and their extraordinary leaders really in [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3812.36s)]
*  there fighting the fight right now, not just talking about it or pontificating about it. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3815.56s)]
*  I'll tell you a couple of things. Donald Trump killed a lot of things. What he killed was [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3819.4s)]
*  killing our economy. He's killing education. He's killing healthcare. But you know what? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3824.36s)]
*  He also killed complacency. I don't think there's an American alive right now who's [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3830.44s)]
*  watching what is unfolding over these last 100 days, and there's 1,362 more to go. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3836.1200000000003s)]
*  That are feeling complacent or empathetic and sit on the sidelines. No, no, no. They are energized. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3842.6s)]
*  They're mobilized. They're ready to organize. And I can feel it right now in every corner of my state [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3848.2000000000003s)]
*  and across this country. And that is the power of the American people. Don't ever count us down. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3853.32s)]
*  We're never out. We do fight back. And I can give you one example of hope because that's something [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3859.1600000000003s)]
*  a little bit of loss today. A lot of people are giving up hope. They're despairing over the state [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3865.48s)]
*  of affairs and their own family's affairs. I cut my teeth into politics. My parents used to [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3868.84s)]
*  protest the Vietnam War. I used to wear a black armband when I was in my Catholic grade school. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3874.6000000000004s)]
*  The nuns didn't like that. But this is in my genes. I'm genetically created to protest and [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3878.76s)]
*  be an agitator. So I was a kid when I saw Richard Nixon resign in disgrace after Watergate and fly [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3885.0s)]
*  off in a helicopter off the White House lawn. Our country was in disarray. The vice president was in [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3892.76s)]
*  trouble. Our country was literally imploding. We lost young people during the Vietnam War. We lost [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3897.48s)]
*  people at Kent State, the shooting. Look it up in your history books, young people. But listen, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3902.68s)]
*  you know what happened the next year? 1974 was the greatest wave of Democrats elected to Congress [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3906.6s)]
*  that our country had seen at that point. Had seen at that point. So that's what's in store for us. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3912.92s)]
*  You don't give up. You use that anger and channel it into action. That's what I'm calling for from [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3918.68s)]
*  everyone. We'll stand together. We'll get through this. We've been through a lot. And we'll look [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3924.44s)]
*  back, people look back at our time and ask your grandkids will ask you what did you do during the [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3928.92s)]
*  Trump administration? You can look at them and say, I fought back and we won. Thank you, Governor. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3933.56s)]
*  And I want to thank all of the governors for joining us on the Midas Touch Network for this [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3939.4s)]
*  virtual town hall. This was an important and necessary conversation. It was also the number [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3943.88s)]
*  one stream on all of YouTube this evening thanks to your participation. We're also grateful [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3950.04s)]

*  but most importantly for your fight for democracy. The stakes could not be higher [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3961.72s)]
*  and we appreciate you all meeting the moment and sharing this moment this evening with all of us [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3966.68s)]
*  at the Midas Mighty. I'm Ben Mycelis. This has been a presentation of the Midas Touch Network. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-0ecbBSbbk&t=3972.36s)]
