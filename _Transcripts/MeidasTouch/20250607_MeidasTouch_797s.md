# Trump Faces MAJOR BACKLASH as he KILLS HIS TERM
**MeidasTouch:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4)
*  This is what it looks like to live in Donald Trump's America today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=0.0s)]
*  That video was taken in Los Angeles, California, where an unlawful assembly was declared after [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=14.06s)]
*  ICE was engaged in vicious raids in courthouses in Los Angeles, in factories in Los Angeles, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=21.32s)]
*  at home depots in Los Angeles. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=28.92s)]
*  And while all of that's taking place in LA and across the United States, we highlighted [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  what was going on in San Diego, in Memphis, in Massachusetts, and frankly in every state. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=36.54s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump's been posting. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  Just inspected the site of a new ballroom that will be built, compliments of a man known [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  as Donald J. Trump at the White House for 150 years. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  And many others have wanted a big beautiful ballroom. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  To hell. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  And then Donald Trump reposts Roger Stone saying, it's time to put President Trump on [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  Mount Rushmore. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=66.96s)]
*  Congresswoman Annapolina Luna has sponsored legislation to put Trump on Mount Rushmore [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=68.56s)]
*  and he urges people to support that initiative. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=73.92s)]
*  So while Donald Trump is posting about Mount Rushmore, you have things escalating in Los [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=77.72s)]
*  Angeles here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=84.92s)]
*  Play this clip right here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=86.24s)]
*  But what is Donald Trump doing? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=95.96s)]
*  Well, he's posting things like this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=97.52s)]
*  The new presidential portrait of one of the most consequential presidents in world history. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=100.24s)]
*  That's what he's posting. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  Or he's reposting this message by David Shone who goes, I was hired to lead Jeffrey Epstein's [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=108.24s)]
*  defense as his criminal lawyer nine days before he died. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=115.16s)]
*  He sought my advice months before that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=119.32s)]
*  I can say authoritatively, unequivocally and definitively that he had no information to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=122.0s)]
*  hurt President Trump. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=127.36s)]
*  I specifically asked him. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=129.12s)]
*  So Donald Trump's reposting a dude who literally knew Epstein nine days before Epstein died. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=131.6s)]
*  And Donald Trump thinks that that's helpful to him. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=138.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump's feud with Elon Musk continues and Elon Musk writes, I will apologize profusely [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=141.56s)]
*  as soon as there is a full dump of the Epstein files. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=148.68s)]
*  Elon Musk says that the reason Donald Trump has not released the Epstein files is because [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=152.8s)]
*  the DOJ is covering it up because Donald Trump's name is all over it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  And Donald Trump seems pretty scared about Elon Musk. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=163.68s)]
*  Donald Trump was on Air Force One. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=166.24s)]
*  He was asked about Elon Musk and Donald Trump said, I just wish him well. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=168.56s)]
*  I just wish him well is what Donald Trump said. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=173.48s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=176.08s)]
*  What's your view on Elon Musk as of today? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=177.76s)]
*  I mean, have you heard from him at all? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=180.16s)]
*  Honestly, I've been so busy working on China, working on Russia, working on Iran, working on so many... [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=182.16s)]
*  I'm not thinking about him. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=187.96s)]
*  On the show, I just wish him well. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=189.16s)]
*  And while Donald Trump says, I wish him well, this is what's going on outside of MDC [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=191.36s)]
*  in Los Angeles, take a look at... [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=198.36s)]
*  You see ICE officers, LAPD, ATF, and protesters right there. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=202.16000000000003s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=207.36s)]
*  And I think seeing the contrast between these images just shows you what's happening in America, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=208.56s)]
*  how detached Donald Trump is. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=235.96s)]
*  And it's not just Donald Trump sending ICE to disappear migrants in courthouses and construction sites. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=237.56s)]
*  People who are following the law and people who are working, that's who ICE is attacking. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=244.16s)]
*  But Donald Trump is not addressing the horrible storms that have killed dozens of Americans [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=249.96s)]
*  over the past month or several weeks. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=256.96s)]
*  No mention of that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=260.56s)]
*  No mention of our troops who have died in Lithuania and two troops who died in New Mexico. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=261.56s)]
*  He doesn't mention that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=267.16s)]
*  And then when Donald Trump's asked these softball questions, like on Air Force One, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=269.16s)]
*  did the Ukraine drone airstrike against the bombers? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=273.56s)]
*  Did that change your view that Zelensky has the cards? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=277.16s)]
*  Zelensky's incredible military operation against Russia. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump's response is, no, that just gave Putin a reason to go and bomb the hell out of them. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  So again, Donald Trump takes Putin's side here on Air Force One. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=291.56s)]
*  Did the Ukraine drone strikes against the bombers inside Russia on the airfields? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=296.36s)]
*  Did that change your view at all, or what Zelensky, the cards he has? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=302.36s)]
*  Well, they gave them a reason to go and bomb the hell out of them last night. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=306.56s)]
*  That's something I didn't like about what I saw. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  And I said, here we go, now it's going to be a strike. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, I did something that people don't talk about, and I don't talk about very much, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  but we solved a big problem, a nuclear problem, potentially with India [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  and with Pakistan, and I spoke to Pakistan, I spoke to India, they have really great leaders. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=324.96s)]
*  And they were going at it, and they could have gone down that nuclear bomb, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=330.56s)]
*  nuclear country, stronger countries. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=333.96s)]
*  And they talked about trade, and they said, we're not doing trade, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=336.56s)]
*  I mean, that's, you know, we're throwing bombs at each other, and they both stopped. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=339.56s)]
*  And I stopped that war immediately. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=343.56s)]
*  That was going, as you know, that was going much further, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=345.56s)]
*  and hopefully not to nuclear, but might have gone to nuclear. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=348.56s)]
*  In fact, it might have gone to nuclear in the next round, but we stopped it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=351.56s)]
*  And I'd like to comment the leaders of both Pakistan and India. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=355.56s)]
*  And again, we just have the most pathetic person in the Oval Office. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=359.56s)]
*  Every aspect of this guy is pathetic. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=362.56s)]
*  You know what, he's gearing up for a military parade, a dude who's never been in war before, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=365.56s)]
*  who's never had a military victory, is doing a military parade on his birthday. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=370.56s)]
*  It's all so despicable. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=375.56s)]
*  And also, another taco moment, Trump always chickens out. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=377.56s)]
*  Remember when Donald Trump said, no way, no how, under no circumstances, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=380.56s)]
*  will he be bringing Abrego Garcia home? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=384.56s)]
*  Abrego Garcia, the migrant who lived in Maryland, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=387.56s)]
*  who was disappeared to CICOT, the detention center, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=391.56s)]
*  I call it a concentration camp in El Salvador, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=395.56s)]
*  the Supreme Court said, facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=398.56s)]
*  Trump said, never going to happen. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=402.56s)]
*  Well, they did bring back Abrego Garcia on Friday, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=404.56s)]
*  but then the Trump regime immediately indicted Abrego Garcia [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=408.56s)]
*  on a trafficking charge for bringing other migrants into the United States [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=413.56s)]
*  in a conspiracy to commit trafficking. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=419.56s)]
*  But then Trump and Pam Bondi started linking Abrego Garcia to child trafficking [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=422.56s)]
*  and being a terrorist and things that were nowhere in the indictment either. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=429.56s)]
*  But here's what Trump says about Abrego, play this clip. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=435.56s)]
*  As soon as Abrego Garcia was indicted, Ben Schrader, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=451.56s)]
*  who spent 15 years working in the United States Attorney's Office in Nashville [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=457.56s)]
*  because the indictment happened in Nashville, Tennessee, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=462.56s)]
*  Ben Schrader, former chief of the criminal division, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=465.56s)]
*  he quit, he posted his resignation actually on LinkedIn, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=468.56s)]
*  the moment that politicized indictment dropped. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=472.56s)]
*  And this is someone who was in the Obama administration, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=475.56s)]
*  the Trump administration, Biden administration, and now Trump administration. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=477.56s)]
*  It is interesting to see what they're talking about on right-wing media. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=482.56s)]
*  This is what Charlie Kirk says about Trump, play this clip. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=486.56s)]

*  A hat tip to the Tennessee holler for posting, play this clip. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=523.56s)]
*  I don't know what my dad, he's not a criminal. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=527.56s)]
*  He's not a criminal. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=531.56s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=533.56s)]
*  Get back. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=534.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=535.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=536.56s)]
*  Just say why? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=537.56s)]

*  Why? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=540.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=541.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=542.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=543.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=544.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=545.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=546.56s)]
*  Just say why. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=548.56s)]
*  As Justin Wolfers explains, he's an economist, he's a professor at University of Michigan, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=549.56s)]
*  he says, here's the progress report on the 90 countries the White House is negotiating [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=555.56s)]
*  trade deals with. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=560.56s)]
*  There's zero deals in 90 days so far. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=561.56s)]
*  What happened in the United Kingdom was not a deal. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=564.56s)]
*  It was just Donald Trump capitulating. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=566.56s)]
*  It says, this is not a deal. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=569.56s)]
*  On the bottom it says, this is a memorandum of understanding and not a binding deal. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=573.56s)]
*  The unemployment rate is slowly creeping up. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=577.56s)]
*  It is really the highest it's been, I think, since like 2021. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=580.56s)]
*  There was some growth in the healthcare sector and in restaurants, but there was no growth [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=586.56s)]
*  really anywhere else. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=592.56s)]
*  We lost 8,000 manufacturing jobs in the past month. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=593.56s)]
*  There was 92,000 jobs lost. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=598.56s)]
*  There was a revision over the past two months of jobs that were lost. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=603.56s)]
*  Then again, while you have these horrific images that I've been showing you across the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=607.56s)]
*  country, this is Donald Trump golfing. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=611.56s)]
*  Here's just kind of what Donald Trump, this is what he goes about and does. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=615.56s)]
*  This was taken a few months ago. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=622.56s)]
*  This just goes to show you like this is what he's doing. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=625.56s)]
*  He's just a gross dude. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=629.56s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=630.56s)]
*  Hey. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=632.56s)]
*  Oh, I love that girl. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=636.56s)]
*  I love that hair. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=637.56s)]
*  I want her hair. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=638.56s)]
*  You're a pirate. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=639.56s)]
*  Can I buy your hair? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=640.56s)]
*  I'll pay you millions. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=641.56s)]
*  What were you going to call the court tonight? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=642.56s)]
*  I voted for you. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=644.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=647.56s)]
*  I voted for you. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=648.56s)]
*  It should also be noted that Washington, D.C.'s Reagan National Airport is set to close [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=649.56s)]
*  on June 14th because of Trump's birthday military parade. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=654.56s)]
*  So Trump's going to be causing massive flight delays. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=658.56s)]
*  You have Donald Trump posting the following. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=661.56s)]
*  Trump meme coin is a tracker of his success somehow. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=664.56s)]
*  He's touting his meme coin. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=669.56s)]
*  How disgusting is that? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=671.56s)]
*  Then the last thing I want to point out is here's Peter Navarro talking about, oh, don't [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=675.56s)]
*  worry. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=680.56s)]
*  The deals are coming with Maria Bartiroma. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=681.56s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=682.56s)]
*  Are you expecting more trade deals in the near term? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=683.56s)]
*  Because Peter, we keep hearing that India could be next and the EU is doing this fast [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=687.56s)]
*  tracking. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=692.56s)]
*  When are we going to have more deals to talk about in terms of tariff deals? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=693.56s)]
*  Well, the United States Trade Representative Building, I don't know if you've ever been [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=698.56s)]
*  over this, right across the street. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=703.56s)]
*  It's a historic building that played a really important role in the Civil War. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=705.56s)]
*  But it looks more like a deli now where you go in and you get your number and you stand [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=709.56s)]
*  in line and you do that so you can negotiate with James and Greer, the USTR and Howard [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=714.56s)]
*  Ludnick, the Secretary of Commerce. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=719.56s)]
*  And that's what we're doing. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=721.56s)]
*  We've got a formula and a template. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=723.56s)]
*  We go through five different verticals to make sure the American people are protected. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=726.56s)]
*  And we will have deals. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=731.56s)]
*  It takes time. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=734.56s)]
*  Usually it takes months and years. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=735.56s)]
*  In this administration, it's going to take more like days. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=738.56s)]
*  We're on task and on target. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=741.56s)]
*  And at the end of the day, you know what we want, Maria. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=744.56s)]
*  All we want is fairness. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=747.56s)]
*  We have the highest tariffs facing us in the world, the highest trade barriers. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=748.56s)]
*  It's not a China problem. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=753.56s)]
*  It's a world problem. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=755.56s)]
*  And we're going to fix it because that's what President Trump does. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=757.56s)]
*  I'm going to do a whole nother hot take on what's going down in Los Angeles. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DQqaEB_pf4&t=760.56s)]
