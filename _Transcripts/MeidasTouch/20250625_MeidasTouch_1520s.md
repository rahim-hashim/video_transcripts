*  If you don't know those things about the rate, how did I do that? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=423.1s)]
*  So your agency nearly doubled the taxpayer dollars that for-profit [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=426.8s)]
*  insurance corporations like United will be paid next year. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=431.09999999999997s)]
*  Next up you had Democratic Congressmember Ruiz asking RFK jr. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=434.4s)]
*  Let me get this straight. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=439.5s)]
*  Why did you submit a report that you're relying upon to basically [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=441.8s)]
*  prevent people in America from getting immunization and vaccination [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=447.2s)]
*  that seems to have relied on all AI and you literally cited fake [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=451.2s)]
*  studies that didn't exist and fake scientists and just like literally [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=455.4s)]
*  fake data and then RFK jr. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=459.5s)]
*  Like well actually those were just some typos. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=461.9s)]
*  But what really happened was all of the data is actually still accurate [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=466.2s)]
*  and Congressmember Ruiz is like how is it accurate if you literally [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=470.5s)]
*  relied on false reports that don't exist play this clip. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=474.29999999999995s)]
*  Mr. Secretary Kennedy, you're listed as the chair of the Commission. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=478.2s)]
*  Did you read the report and fact-check its sources prior to publication? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=481.8s)]
*  All of the factual... [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=485.90000000000003s)]
*  Did you read the reports and did you yourself fact-check them sir? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=487.7s)]
*  I did not fact-check. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=492.1s)]
*  You did not fact-check. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=493.5s)]
*  Why then as has been reported... [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=494.3s)]
*  All of the foundational assertions... [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=496.8s)]
*  Excuse me sir, I'm speaking. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=498.3s)]
*  Why then did the report include a citation to sources that don't even exist? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=499.3s)]
*  How does that happen under your leadership sir? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  All of the foundational assertions in that report are accurate. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=507.3s)]
*  They did not exist. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=511.3s)]
*  How can they be accurate if they did not exist sir? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=512.6s)]
*  Some of the citations were... [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=515.0s)]
*  You know in fact my understanding is that even once the report was updated [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=516.7s)]
*  more authors and researchers came forward stating that their research was misconstrued. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=523.8s)]
*  This is quite unbelievable sir. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=530.0s)]
*  In fact, I was a pre-med at UCLA. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=532.1s)]
*  They have a great pre-med program. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=534.8s)]
*  If somebody turned this in as an undergrad to their professor at UCLA, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=536.8s)]
*  they would have received an F sir. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=542.1999999999999s)]
*  An F for the misinterpretation, the falsehoods, the denials, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=544.4s)]
*  and also citing references that don't even exist. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=549.5999999999999s)]
*  That's lying and dishonest sir. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=552.5999999999999s)]
*  My concern here... [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=555.4s)]
*  The citations were corrected in one day. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=556.6999999999999s)]
*  You and this administration are undertaking vast changes to our federal public health system [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=559.4s)]
*  and using purported facts and gold standard evidence that you claim to have [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=566.2s)]
*  as justifications for your decisions, actions, and frankly your dis- [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  decimation of our nation's public health infrastructure. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=575.4000000000001s)]
*  Yet what you are relying upon isn't real. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=579.2s)]
*  It isn't data driven and it isn't based in fact, science, or reality sir. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  It's wrong. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=588.5s)]
*  And then RFK Jr. states that his vision for every American [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=589.4000000000001s)]
*  is to be wearing a wearable within four years. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=594.3000000000001s)]
*  You know, what like tracks you and tracks your health and tracks everything about you. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=597.7s)]
*  So remember when the MAGA Republicans were like, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=602.1s)]
*  oh the Democrats want to put chips in your body and they want to literally track you. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=604.7s)]
*  Let me get this straight. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=609.1s)]
*  You have Elon Musk literally wants to install a chip in your head. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=610.3000000000001s)]
*  That's what Musk is building, a chip inside your brain and your head. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=615.3000000000001s)]
*  But I guess MAGA is okay with that. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=619.6s)]
*  You have a AI company called Palantir having a government contract with the Trump regime [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=622.0s)]
*  to create databases and lists on every American. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=629.1s)]
*  You have RFK Jr. wanting everybody to wear a device called a wearable [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=633.7s)]
*  that will track everything about their health and send it to the government. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=639.2s)]
*  Okay, that's a- [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=643.2s)]
*  It's always projection and confession with these MAGA's. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=644.9s)]
*  Here play this clip of RFK Jr. talking about the wearables. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=647.6s)]
*  About their physical activity, about the way that they live their lives. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=652.0s)]
*  We think that wearables are a key to the MAGA agenda making America healthy again. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=656.8000000000001s)]
*  And we are going to- [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=663.0s)]
*  My vision is that every American is wearing a wearable within four years. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=664.6s)]
*  Yep, I guess that's what MAGA meant by MAGA, government tracking you. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=669.7s)]
*  Let's be honest, coffee isn't just a drink. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=674.1s)]
*  It's my lifeline and everyone at Midas and you all know that I take my coffee [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=676.1s)]
*  very seriously as the resident coffee geek here. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=680.3s)]
*  So when I tell you I found the best, I mean it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=683.3s)]
*  It's called Trade and it's completely changed my morning routine. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=685.5999999999999s)]
*  Trade is the number one US coffee destination working with over 50 of the country's top roasters. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=688.9s)]
*  They've taste tested thousands of coffees to curate over 450 roasts and they help you find the perfect one. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=693.9s)]
*  You just take a quick quiz seriously under a minute and boom, they match you with your ideal cup. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=700.4s)]
*  And if your first bag isn't quite right, Trade will replace it for free until they nail it. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=705.6s)]
*  My current favorite, this Ethiopian roast from Temple Coffee Roasters in Sacramento. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=710.5s)]
*  Super fresh with the roast date printed right on the bag. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=715.2s)]
*  It smells incredible and it's so fresh I could smell it through the packaging and the taste. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=718.2s)]
*  Notes of tangerine, mango and stone fruit. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=723.1s)]
*  It makes for a smooth balanced cup every single time. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=726.0s)]
*  And the best part, I don't have to go to the store or overpay at the cafe. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=729.5s)]
*  Fresh roasted to order coffee shows up right at my door. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=733.5s)]
*  It's like I'm getting a gift for myself every few weeks. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=736.7s)]
*  Right now Trade is exclusively offering our listeners 50% off your one month trial at www.drinktrade.com. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=739.3s)]

*  www.drinktrade.com. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=756.2s)]
*  Next you have Congress, Democratic Congress member Kelly speaking to RFK Jr. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=759.7s)]
*  about the fact that the still the HHS COVID vaccine webpage still lists it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=765.7s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=772.2s)]
*  What you said was wrong. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=772.9000000000001s)]
*  We're not depriving anybody of choice. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=774.9000000000001s)]
*  If a pregnant woman wants the COVID-19 vaccine, she can get it. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=776.9000000000001s)]
*  No longer recommending it because there was no science supporting that recommendation. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=781.4000000000001s)]
*  There's study after study that shows adverse events. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=786.7s)]
*  One study, 27 adverse events during pregnancy from that campaign. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=790.2s)]
*  I'm going to interrupt you because I need to reclaim my time. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=795.2s)]
*  Another study shows an increase in miscarriage. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=797.2s)]
*  There's no safety data for it. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=798.7s)]
*  So we're not going to recommend it. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=800.2s)]
*  Not true. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=801.7s)]
*  We have a pediatrician that is on this committee. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=802.2s)]
*  Not true. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=805.8000000000001s)]
*  I'll go back to does HHS COVID-19 vaccine webpage reflect the department's view, viewpoint on COVID-19 vaccines? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=806.8000000000001s)]
*  Please. Yes or no. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=815.3s)]
*  I didn't understand the question. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=816.9s)]
*  You're asking if if the HHS is COVID-19 vaccine webpage reflect the department's viewpoint on COVID-19 vaccines. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=818.4s)]
*  I imagine it does. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=830.5999999999999s)]
*  I haven't seen the website. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=832.1999999999999s)]
*  You haven't seen HHS is COVID-19 vaccine. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=834.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, I haven't read the entire. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=837.1999999999999s)]
*  It's kind of troubling that you're unaware of what your own department's website states on the safety and efficacy of the vaccination. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=839.1s)]
*  Let me read it directly to you. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=846.1s)]
*  COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective and COVID-19 vaccines are available to everyone six months and older. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=848.0s)]
*  Getting vaccinated vaccinated is the best way to help protect people from COVID-19. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=856.1s)]
*  Get vaccinated. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=862.1s)]
*  If you haven't chairman, I have the paper copy of the website to insert into the record. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=863.4s)]
*  Democratic Congressmember Carter right here. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=869.1s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=871.1999999999999s)]
*  It's unacceptable, sir. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=871.9s)]
*  Lastly, I'd like to bring your attention termination of HIV vaccine studies. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=873.6999999999999s)]
*  These cuts make up a hundred two hundred and fifty eight million dollars. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=877.8s)]
*  Secretary Kennedy, did you make the decision to terminate these studies? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=881.9s)]
*  I didn't personally make that decision, but I understand. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=886.6999999999999s)]
*  You sanction them. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=889.8s)]
*  How could you possibly justify such an action? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=890.8000000000001s)]
*  We've been studying an HIV and promising an HIV vaccine since 1984 and every year Congress pours money into it and every year they haven't come up with word accomplishes. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=894.7s)]
*  The forward motion by getting rid of NIH dollars that critically do research that saved lives and because it hasn't happened yet. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=906.7s)]
*  Well, we have only one. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=914.3000000000001s)]
*  So it's my time. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=915.1s)]
*  It's my time. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=915.9000000000001s)]
*  So it's my time, sir. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=916.6s)]
*  Show me why I can show you a whole lot of lives if you got a minute. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=918.3s)]
*  I'm insulted that you would suggest that there aren't lives that have been lost. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=921.0999999999999s)]
*  People are dying every day, sir. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=924.9s)]
*  And for you to say, show me one, there are people all over this country that are suffering the loss of their loved ones. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=927.1999999999999s)]

*  Some great cross exam. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=934.5s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=935.8s)]
*  Now, I know Senator Cassidy had concerns about your views on this. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=936.6999999999999s)]
*  And so when he voted to confirm you as Secretary of HHS on February 4th, he explained that decision by saying on the Senate floor that quote, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=942.1s)]
*  if confirmed, you will maintain the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without changes. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=953.8s)]
*  But then two weeks ago, you fired all 17 experts on that very committee. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=963.1s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, question for you. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=969.7s)]
*  Did you lie to Senator Cassidy when you told him you would not change this panel of experts? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=972.1s)]
*  I never made that agreement. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=977.4000000000001s)]
*  So are you saying that Senator Cassidy lied when he was on the Senate floor, lied to the American people? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=979.6s)]
*  I didn't see that statement by Senator Cassidy. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=986.1s)]
*  I've only heard it from you. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=988.6s)]
*  But if he said that I agreed to it, it would be inaccurate. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=989.6s)]
*  I made an agreement with him. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=994.0s)]
*  I made an agreement with him and he and I have talked many times about that agreement. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=995.7s)]
*  My time. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1000.7s)]
*  I just want to tell you that for most of us sitting here right now, we believe Senator Cassidy more than we trust you when it comes to vaccinations. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1001.6s)]
*  It sounds to me like you gave him the answer he needed to hear in order to get his confirmation vote. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1011.1s)]
*  And then as soon as you were secretary, you turned around and did whatever you want. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1018.1s)]
*  You fired all 17 members. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1022.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm complying with all the agreements that I gave you, Senator Cassidy. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1025.9s)]
*  You're now on the record. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1029.9s)]
*  You lied to Senator Cassidy. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1030.9s)]
*  You have lied to the American people. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1033.0s)]
*  You have lied to parents about vaccines for 20 years. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1034.9s)]
*  And I also want to be clear that I will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine preventable illness at your feet. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1039.2s)]
*  I yield back. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1049.6000000000001s)]
*  While that was going on, you had Mago Republican Congress member Turner saying that, OK, we know the US bombs did not destroy Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1050.6s)]
*  That's not news because it was never the goal to destroy the nuclear sites. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1060.3999999999999s)]
*  That's what the Mago Republicans are going with. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1064.8999999999999s)]
*  We never wanted to destroy the nuclear sites. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1067.0s)]
*  So really, that's what they're going. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1069.8s)]
*  Like, do you all just think that we are stupid? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1072.1s)]
*  You promised you destroyed the nuclear sites. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1074.8999999999999s)]
*  The whole thing was denuclearization. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1077.1s)]
*  That's what you said. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1079.0s)]
*  So you didn't destroy the nuclear sites. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1080.1s)]
*  Iran still has nuclear weapons. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1082.0s)]
*  They're speeding it up. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1083.5s)]
*  They're no longer working with the IAEA. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1084.5s)]
*  So there's going to be no supervision of it. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1087.6999999999998s)]
*  They're meeting with Putin and Russia and China and cementing their alliances against the United States there. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1089.6999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump praised China and said that China should be buying cheap oil from Iran. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1098.6999999999998s)]
*  What was it? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1105.6999999999998s)]
*  I guess it was make Iran great again. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1107.5s)]
*  It was the whole plan to make Iran great again because you know who it benefits if you have a really strong Iran? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1109.4s)]
*  You know who it benefits? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1115.1000000000001s)]
*  Putin and Russia because Iran is supplying Putin with the Shahed drones that are killing the innocent Ukrainians. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1116.4s)]
*  But I'm sure we all knew that here playing this clip. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1123.8000000000002s)]
*  But then let's go to the next step is that we have this headline that CNN is reporting with the headline says [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1125.9s)]
*  US bombs did not destroy Iran's nuclear sites early until suggests what's what's troubling about that headline. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1132.8s)]
*  And Phil, let's let's try to get us all back on track here. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1142.7s)]
*  Is it that headline is not fake news, but it's it's not news because the administration did not say that the bombs destroyed Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1146.3999999999999s)]
*  I have in front of me the president's statement and the president said that they had sent they had carried out massive precision strikes on three key nuclear facilities. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1158.3s)]
*  Then you have a mega Republican Congress member McCall on CNN who was really upset that the intelligence showing that Trump did not destroy the nuclear sites that that leaked. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1170.8s)]
*  And McCall says I've been briefed on this plan in the past. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1184.0s)]
*  The plan was never to destroy the nuclear facilities. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1187.5s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1190.6s)]
*  So you've got McCall and Turner saying we never wanted to destroy the facility. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1191.7s)]
*  Oh and give Trump a Nobel Peace Prize here play this clip. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1196.1s)]
*  I'm interested to know your reaction to this considering that President Trump has repeatedly said that the program was quote completely obliterated. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1199.6s)]
*  Well, it's unfortunate that intelligence gets leaked so quickly in this administration. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1210.4s)]
*  I understand the president's frustration having said that it did cause significant damage and I think that's important in terms of a time to negotiate a peaceful resolution. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1215.6s)]
*  However, and I've been briefed on this plan in the past. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1227.4s)]
*  It was never to completely destroy these three facilities, but rather cause significant damage. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1231.6s)]
*  But it was always known to be a temporary setback where they could then rebuild the centrifuges. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1238.7s)]
*  Democratic Congress member Robert Garcia became the head of the House of the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1244.1s)]
*  Great news right there. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1252.8s)]
*  He came on the Midas Touch Network first. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1253.8999999999999s)]
*  Let's play it and straight off the post-victory win the ranking member of the House of the Oversight Committee. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1256.0s)]
*  We have Congress member Robert Garcia, Democrat Congress member Garcia first off. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1263.6999999999998s)]
*  Congratulations on the victory. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1268.0s)]
*  Now the ranking member of the Oversight Committee for the Democrats. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1270.5s)]
*  I was just showing a bunch of clips right there before about Maga Mike Johnson and what he's trying to pull. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1275.3000000000002s)]
*  But let's talk more about what the Democrats are doing for moving the agenda forward and specifically what you're going to be doing now as the ranking member of the Oversight Committee. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1281.5s)]
*  I mean Democrats still in the minority, but what are you going to do? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1291.3000000000002s)]
*  Look first, I'm very grateful of course to the House Democratic Caucus just winning the election. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1295.6000000000001s)]
*  As you all know, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is at the heart of keeping Congress working for the American public. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1301.3000000000002s)]
*  It's about investigations. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1309.1000000000001s)]
*  It's about taking on corruption. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1310.4s)]
*  It's about investigating those that are in power that are trying to damage the public and our institutions. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1312.2s)]
*  At the same time, it's about government reform. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1318.0s)]
*  How do we make government actually work for the public? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1320.4s)]
*  How do we actually make it more efficient? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1323.5s)]
*  How do we actually transform government to support the workforce? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1325.0s)]
*  That's what Oversight is. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1328.2s)]
*  And as we know, Oversight has always been that committee that is investigating corruption. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1329.6s)]
*  And so it's been an honor to work with Jerry Connolly. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1336.6s)]
*  Obviously, Jamie Raskin was one of my heroes coming into Congress and to be able to take on this role as the lead Democrat in this committee. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1339.6s)]
*  We are going to hold Donald Trump and his administration accountable. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1346.1s)]
*  I'm grateful for the support and I'm happy to be here with you. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1351.6999999999998s)]
*  And here we have Democratic Senator Ossoff and his questioning to the head of the VA, Collins. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1355.1s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1362.1s)]
*  17% to 24B. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1363.0s)]
*  Not medical care, medical services. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1364.6s)]
*  So here's your... [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1366.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1367.5s)]
*  Just to be clear, I mean, the chairman mentioned this. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1367.8999999999999s)]
*  We usually get... [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1370.5s)]
*  I understand completely. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1372.0s)]
*  ...specifies how many folks you intend to employ. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1373.1s)]
*  We have a 26-page PowerPoint. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1375.3s)]
*  But in that 26-page PowerPoint, here are specified about $17 billion in cuts to the medical services budget. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1378.3s)]
*  So what are you cutting in medical services? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1386.7s)]
*  Specifically, who are you cutting since that's exclusively personnel? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1389.6000000000001s)]
*  Again, and this is the issue we have right now, and I'll just state this for either of us to go back in circles. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1396.3s)]
*  You'll be getting... [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1402.1000000000001s)]
*  We'll be providing more of those numbers, as I said yesterday, on our phone call this week. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1403.0s)]
*  So at this point in time, the numbers that we're providing are the numbers that we have at this point. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1407.5s)]
*  I'll be happy to talk to you further about those later. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1412.4s)]
*  And understand that, that that's why we usually get these in advance of this hearing. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1416.4s)]
*  I mean, I'm wondering if we need to reconvene having received the full budget request. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1420.4s)]
*  Because the thing that is causing a lot of consternation is this proposed $17-18 billion cut to medical services. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1426.9s)]
*  I mean, that... [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1436.5s)]
*  And so today is the budget hearing where you justify the budget request. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1438.1000000000001s)]
*  So how do you justify this cut to medical services, and who are you going to fire in order to pay for it? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1443.3000000000002s)]
*  And I'll go back to the same answer I gave you just a few minutes ago. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1449.9s)]
*  I mean, in this process, we'll have more information on that part of it as we go forward. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1453.2s)]
*  The basis of the budget was based on the, you know, our workforce as it existed in moving forward. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1457.3000000000002s)]
*  And the numbers have not been cut to the medical... [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1463.3s)]
*  I'm sorry, yes it has. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1466.2s)]
*  You have in your PowerPoint here, $17-18 billion in cuts to medical services. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1468.2s)]
*  Again, this is a 26-page PowerPoint to justify the budget. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1473.2s)]
*  So, and this is the budget hearing. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1478.2s)]
*  So who is getting fired? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1481.2s)]
*  I don't know, Mr. Chairman, if we need to reconvene after they send us the materials. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1487.2s)]
*  But I think this is insufficient, clearly. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1492.2s)]
*  And I'll follow up in my next round. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1495.6000000000001s)]
*  There you have it, folks. Let me know what you think. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzePgUiSIU&t=1498.1000000000001s)]
