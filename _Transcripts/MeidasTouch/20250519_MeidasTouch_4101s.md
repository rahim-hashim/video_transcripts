Video Description: On today’s episode of the MeidasTouch Podcast: As deadly storms rip through the country and families plead for help, Donald Trump remains silent—and FEMA is missing in action. Meanwhile, the Trump-GOP tax scam is about to send the national deficit skyrocketing, and his administration is pretending it’s not happening. We also cover the heartbreaking news of former President Biden’s aggressive cancer diagnosis, and Trump’s unhinged calls to investigate Beyoncé and other celebrities for supporting Kamala Harris. Plus, major defeats for Trump-style candidates abroad, a disturbing update on the Epstein files and Trump’s FBI, new developments in the Russia-Ukraine war, and much more. Ben, Brett and Jordy break it down!

*  But I want to thank everybody also because last week, as Ben mentioned, it was an exciting [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=217.56s)]

*  I'm just going to say this before we dive in. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=254.4s)]
*  Benji, happy birthday, big bro. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=256.36s)]
*  I love you, man. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=258.0s)]
*  Where do you want to start off today? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=259.0s)]
*  Oh, we should start also with our thoughts and prayers and positivity goes out to former [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=260.28s)]
*  President Biden and his entire family. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=266.96s)]
*  By now, you know that he announced that he has a very serious prostate cancer diagnosis. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=270.12s)]
*  Magna Republicans right now are trying to further spread conspiracies about him. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=276.8s)]
*  Corporate news continues to defame him. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=281.92s)]
*  I don't even want to get into that and give that any attention. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=284.52000000000004s)]
*  I just want to send a heartfelt thanks to everything that former President Biden has [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=287.56s)]
*  done for our country and beyond his policies representing decency, compassion, and a true [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=293.48s)]
*  love for our country. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  So I know the Midas might be sending all the positivity we can to former President Biden [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  and his family. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=306.56s)]
*  Let's get into what's been going down. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump got back from this disastrous trip to the Middle East. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=309.84s)]
*  As I posted on various social media accounts, because America is so propagandized and our [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=314.28s)]
*  media basically looks no different than the way Kim Jong-un state regime media works or [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=319.47999999999996s)]
*  Russian state regime media works, the headlines are basically what Donald Trump feeds to the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  media and they just basically posted, oh, Donald Trump did a $1.2 trillion deal with [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=330.4s)]
*  Qatar. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=335.23999999999995s)]
*  No, he didn't. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=336.23999999999995s)]
*  He didn't do a deal with that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=337.23999999999995s)]
*  Their entire GDP is $200 billion. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=338.24s)]
*  They're not giving 6X their GDP to the United States. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=341.44s)]
*  Do some critical evaluation before you just give those types of headlines. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=345.6s)]
*  Most of the quote unquote deals that Donald Trump announced were things that former President [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=351.36s)]
*  Biden did anyway. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=355.36s)]
*  Trump did no deals at all. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=357.64s)]
*  By the way, when you look at these so-called deals that Donald Trump does, like what he [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=359.72s)]
*  kingdom two or three weeks ago as well, it literally said on the bottom of the memorandum [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=364.66s)]
*  of understanding, this is not a binding deal and all it did was give preferential treatment [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=369.78000000000003s)]
*  to Jaguar, Land Rover and Rolls Royce over United States car manufacturers. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=375.94000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump did not do a deal with China, right? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=381.54s)]
*  It was a consensus where Donald Trump just totally caved and capitulated. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump rushed his Treasury Secretary, Scott Besson, his trade representative, James [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=389.38s)]
*  Greer to go to Switzerland because the products from China were not reaching our ports and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=393.94s)]
*  we were about to have a situation where there was going to be nothing on our shelves even [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=400.14s)]
*  worse than COVID. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=405.06s)]
*  Donald Trump caved and just took down the tariffs from 145% to 30%. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=406.06s)]
*  Donald Trump's done zero deals in 90 days and all of these other countries are realizing [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=411.94s)]
*  a horrible negotiator he is, how weak and pathetic, that he doesn't hold the cards. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=417.14000000000004s)]
*  Remember Donald Trump saying, I got the cards, you don't got the cards. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=422.34000000000003s)]
*  Everybody realizes that Donald Trump doesn't have the cards and that you can play him so [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=425.78000000000003s)]
*  easily. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=430.74s)]
*  And not only that, Ben, it seems like we're also hearing anytime Donald Trump leaves, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=431.74s)]
*  right? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=435.78000000000003s)]
*  He makes these big announcements, right? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=436.78000000000003s)]
*  We got a deal here, this country, we did this in this region, in that region. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=437.78000000000003s)]
*  And then he gets all the headlines, the press runs with everything he says verbatim, no [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=442.5s)]
*  matter how ridiculous the numbers are. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=446.74s)]
*  And then inevitably one of the countries comes out and they go, that wasn't what we talked [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=449.02s)]
*  about at all. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=454.46000000000004s)]
*  And in fact, Donald Trump completely offended us. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=455.46000000000004s)]
*  Like we're watching even what happened in India where the Trump administration were [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=457.78000000000003s)]
*  trying to take a credit for this ceasefire between India and Pakistan. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=461.62s)]
*  And India is like furious at Trump right now. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=466.3s)]
*  Like they are absolutely pissed and they think that Trump's trying to take credit and that [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=468.62s)]
*  Trump had nothing to do with this. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=472.5s)]
*  And it's just like an embarrassment. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=474.22s)]
*  It's an international embarrassment to see him go to these countries, then lie, have [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=476.5s)]
*  the press write these headlines without any discernment whatsoever, and then have to have [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=480.86s)]
*  these other heads of state and whatever correct him and correct the record all the time. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=486.22s)]
*  But Trump has understood that our media is so propagandized that all he has to do is [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=490.18s)]
*  just say whatever he wants. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=494.14s)]
*  And it's just basically going to be repeated. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=495.62s)]
*  And they're going to focus on things that aren't really important. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=497.14s)]
*  They're not going to focus on the fact that Trump isn't sending FEMA into these states, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=500.62s)]
*  that he hasn't even activated. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=504.82s)]
*  He's not going to focus on, you know, they're not going to focus on the death toll as a [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=505.86s)]
*  result of Trump and what's going on with the National Weather Service. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=509.14s)]
*  That should be a major scandal. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=512.3s)]
*  We're going to get into all that here as well. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=513.78s)]
*  But the things they're focusing on to run these like 24, you know, 24 hour a day stories [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=515.62s)]
*  on like Biden and to be focused on all these other things to me, it's just a disgrace. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=520.78s)]
*  And you're missing the mark of what serious things that are going on in the country right [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=524.9s)]
*  now. Then, you know, my message throughout all these deals is that his announcements [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=528.3s)]
*  constantly follow the same pattern. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=532.54s)]
*  He declares a major breakthrough only for the details later to reveal that nothing [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=534.54s)]
*  has really changed. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=538.98s)]
*  And in the meantime, the press is just doing his bidding for him. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=540.18s)]
*  And it's just a complete embarrassment to our entire system, to be honest. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=542.98s)]
*  You sort of get the sense, too, that the press is intentionally missing the mark, like [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=547.54s)]
*  they're going up at that plate and they're intentionally striking out with the t-ball [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=551.2199999999999s)]
*  right in front of them. And that's because they're scared of their access. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=554.74s)]
*  They don't want to lose that access. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=558.5s)]
*  That means so much to them. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=560.74s)]
*  It's no longer about accountability and holding Donald Trump accountable in their eyes. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=562.14s)]
*  And that's the saddest thing about this. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=566.8199999999999s)]
*  I want the Fourth Estate to be at its prime and really hitting back hard, but doing [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=568.98s)]
*  so in a way that makes sense and actually just doing their jobs. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=574.3s)]
*  But to see them get up there every single day and just let the ball just pass them [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=578.98s)]
*  by intentionally, it's infuriating. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=584.22s)]
*  And I could sound like a conspiracy theory, right? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=587.18s)]
*  The media is coordinating with Trump and they're trying to do his bidding, right? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=589.5799999999999s)]
*  But then you hear these stories that show that it is very much true. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=593.18s)]
*  Like today we were hearing the story about Wendy McMahon, the president of CBS News, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=597.14s)]
*  and she is resigning because she was on the side of Bill Owens, the 60 Minutes [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=601.9799999999999s)]
*  executive producer who recently resigned because for the first time ever, the higher [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=606.9s)]
*  ups at CBS and the ownership of CBS was saying that they had to adjust their programming [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=611.5799999999999s)]
*  about Donald Trump to appease Donald Trump. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=616.78s)]
*  Like that was coming from the top. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=618.62s)]
*  And these executive producers, these well-respected people at these networks who have been [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=620.22s)]
*  doing these jobs for a very long time, they are now backing out. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=624.02s)]
*  They are now saying, I refuse to be complicit in what is happening right here. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=628.06s)]
*  I understand that they want to do this merger, that they want to do this buyout deal and [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=632.22s)]
*  that they know that Trump is the one who's able to either accept or deny that deal. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=637.38s)]
*  But I'm not going to be complicit in selling out our country in order to give beneficial [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=642.82s)]
*  treatment to Donald Trump. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=648.22s)]
*  I mean, it's just a complete abdication of the role of the fourth estate. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=649.9s)]
*  And that's why I want this media to succeed. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=653.82s)]
*  I really do want them to do well. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=657.0600000000001s)]
*  I want them to be able to do their job. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=658.74s)]
*  But it so pisses me off when we learn about what's going on. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=660.78s)]
*  And shout out to Wendy McMahon for her courage in calling this out, in coming out in [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=664.7s)]
*  public and speaking out about what her network is doing behind the scenes to these [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=670.62s)]
*  shows, which are supposed to be able to call balls and strikes. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=675.26s)]
*  But right now they are trying to appease Donald Trump. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=677.82s)]
*  Let's take a look at this clip from the St. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=681.14s)]
*  Louis mayor, Kara Spencer. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=683.1s)]
*  And this should be the biggest story of the day of the week. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=685.74s)]
*  This should be a front page story. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=692.02s)]
*  Donald Trump has not sent FEMA into St. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=694.38s)]
*  Louis or any of these areas that have just been devastated by tornadoes and horrific [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=698.8199999999999s)]
*  weather events that have killed 28 Americans as of this recording. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=705.22s)]
*  That that has not happened. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=711.8199999999999s)]
*  The first thing you do is you activate FEMA and FEMA gets on the ground and FEMA works [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=713.4599999999999s)]
*  with local and state officials to coordinate things, especially as we now approach [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=720.38s)]
*  hurricane season. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=726.38s)]
*  What's going to happen then when a hurricane strikes and FEMA isn't doing its job? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=728.1s)]
*  We've been reporting about this FEMA issue and issues regarding the National Weather [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=734.1s)]
*  Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency that Donald Trump has gutted [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=739.3000000000001s)]
*  for months and months. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=745.3000000000001s)]
*  We've made it a major story here at the Midas Touch Network, not just a passing story [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=747.06s)]
*  that gets half a day treatment and then goes away. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=752.9s)]
*  What could be more fundamental to what a government is supposed to do than in a time [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=757.2199999999999s)]
*  of distress provide the service? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=763.66s)]
*  What are we paying our taxes for? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=766.2199999999999s)]
*  It's certainly not to have a already billionaire born with a golden spoon in his mouth [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=768.8199999999999s)]
*  like Donald Trump go to Qatar so he can brag for gold play to jets. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=775.38s)]
*  That ain't frickin normal. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=779.9s)]
*  Let's play this clip of Mayor Spencer from St. Louis. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=782.46s)]
*  Just true for St. Louis. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=787.3s)]
*  Cities across the nation, when they are when experiencing disasters such as this, this [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=788.42s)]
*  is what the federal government is for. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=793.82s)]
*  We need your help. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=795.9s)]
*  We need the help of the broader community. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=797.42s)]
*  We have set up a fund to help bring in some funding right off the bat just to bridge [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=798.82s)]
*  that gap, but we need federal assistance. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=805.22s)]
*  There is no way. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=808.1s)]
*  Is FEMA there? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=809.38s)]
*  Is FEMA on the ground yet? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=810.38s)]
*  FEMA has not been on the ground. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=812.58s)]
*  We do not have confirmed assistance from FEMA at this point. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=814.34s)]
*  Did you hear what she said? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=817.78s)]
*  We had to set up a fund like a GoFundMe because the federal government is not helping out. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=819.6600000000001s)]
*  OK, that's where we begin the top of our story on the Midas Touch Podcast. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=828.7s)]
*  What the hell is going on? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=833.5s)]
*  And it's not just unique to that. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=834.9s)]
*  I want you to think about all the other people who have been fired, the people who worked [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=837.14s)]
*  at the NIH, National Institutes of Health, the people who worked at the CDC, the people [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=841.5s)]
*  who work at research facilities. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=847.14s)]
*  I want you to think about the veterans who were fired, the people who work and Veterans [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=849.78s)]
*  Affairs who were fired. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=854.78s)]
*  I want you to think about the people who work in the national parks, the people across all [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=856.14s)]
*  government agencies who provide critical functions that Donald Trump and Elon Musk defamed, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=860.2199999999999s)]
*  gave them the middle finger and said, we're firing you for performance related reasons. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=868.4599999999999s)]
*  Go f yourself, destroyed their lives and dismantled our government. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=874.78s)]
*  We did another report on this as well. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=880.9s)]
*  And I talked about it this weekend that Trump fired the head of FEMA, who was a MAGA guy, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=882.7399999999999s)]
*  the interim head of FEMA, because the guy refused to say during a congressional hearing [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=888.66s)]
*  two weeks ago that he wanted to dismantle FEMA. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=893.78s)]
*  Christine Ohm, dog killer, Homeland Security Secretary, said that she wanted to do was [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=897.9s)]
*  actively seeking to dismantle FEMA. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=903.74s)]
*  And the FEMA guy said he personally personally believed that would be a bad decision. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=907.18s)]
*  This was a MAGA guy who ran as a ran for Congress as he said, I'm the MAGA candidate. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=912.3399999999999s)]
*  He got fired for saying he didn't want to dismantle his own agency. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=918.3399999999999s)]
*  So I want I'm trying to raise right now the alarms of what's going to happen. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=922.18s)]
*  And we're seeing what's happening right there. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=928.5s)]
*  It's I'd like to just point out a pattern as well, Ben. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=930.54s)]
*  And that's in all these situations like we've seen now multiple deadly storms, fatal [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=933.02s)]
*  storms occur under the Trump administration. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=937.9799999999999s)]
*  We're seeing the storms that we're speaking about right now. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=940.2199999999999s)]
*  And just a few months ago, if you remember, there was like there were storms that had [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=942.5s)]
*  at least like 40 deaths in Arkansas, Missouri, Mississippi, Oklahoma. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=945.78s)]
*  No FEMA aid to those states to no FEMA to those states to and Donald Trump, again, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=949.74s)]
*  did not even like speak out about those issues, did not even say any words of comfort, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=955.22s)]
*  not even like for all of his posts. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=959.86s)]
*  He's posting about, you know, wanting to arrest Bono and and frickin Bruce Springsteen [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=961.4599999999999s)]
*  and Beyonce and people for speaking out against them. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=966.8199999999999s)]
*  He's saying Taylor Swift isn't hot. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=968.9399999999999s)]
*  This is he's posting QAnon memes about military tribunals for Obama, all this crazy [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=970.5s)]
*  stuff that we'll get to in a little bit. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=975.06s)]
*  And he can't even do one post saying, listen, I hear you. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=976.7399999999999s)]
*  I'm with you. I'm going to use the weight of the United States government to ensure [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=982.14s)]
*  your safety, to ensure you are OK, even with our troops, our troops dying. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=986.5799999999999s)]
*  Right. We saw the death of our troops both near our border right here, who were sent [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=992.14s)]
*  on this mission to secure the border by Donald Trump. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=997.4599999999999s)]
*  We also saw our troops die in Lithuania. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1000.02s)]
*  Donald Trump did not release a statement. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1002.9399999999999s)]
*  And when Donald Trump was asked about it, he acted like he didn't even know what the [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1004.8199999999999s)]
*  person was talking about in the envelope. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1008.1s)]
*  Oh, what do you mean? People died. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1009.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, what are you talking about? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1011.38s)]
*  And that's his move. If you've noticed, his move is to just totally act oblivious to [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1013.02s)]
*  everything, just anything that could look bad. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1017.3399999999999s)]
*  He goes, I never even heard of that. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1019.98s)]
*  What? I don't know. And then you have people like even Sarah Huckabee Sanders in the [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1021.42s)]
*  last storms. Right. She was begging Trump to do something, do something, help us out. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1025.18s)]
*  What the hell are you doing, man? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1029.46s)]
*  And he refused and he refused then and he refuses now. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1030.82s)]
*  And the amount of shit that he and all those mag influencers, I think back to, you know, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1034.3799999999999s)]
*  when there were the storms in Georgia, when there were the storms in North Carolina. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1039.3799999999999s)]
*  And what did President Biden do at the time? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1043.4199999999998s)]
*  He picked up the phone instantly. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1045.4199999999998s)]
*  He declared emergency declarations. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1047.06s)]
*  He immediately got on the phone with people like Brian Kemp. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1049.1399999999999s)]
*  He went into action. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1052.06s)]
*  And that's not even something that deserves. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1053.6599999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. He went into action. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1055.86s)]
*  That's what you're supposed to do as the president in the United States. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1057.1s)]
*  And Donald Trump is not even doing the bare minimum here. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1060.18s)]
*  Like pick up the damn phone, contact the officials, see what they need, do what people [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1063.22s)]
*  need from their government. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1068.06s)]
*  It's basic governance right here that is completely getting swept under. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1069.66s)]
*  And nobody is speaking about this as a scandal when to me, this is like the biggest [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1073.3s)]
*  scandal imaginable. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1078.54s)]
*  This is like I mentioned during Katrina, Bush just totally even ignored it. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1079.8600000000001s)]
*  Like we talk about his bad response. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1084.18s)]
*  Trump has no response to these storms. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1085.6200000000001s)]
*  It's honestly outrageous. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1087.58s)]
*  Let me share with you this. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1089.94s)]
*  Donald Trump then talks about how he talks about his Middle East trip during this press [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1091.18s)]
*  conference and he claims he secured five trillion dollars here. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1096.7800000000002s)]
*  Play this clip. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1100.98s)]
*  Because there's no place like the White House, I found out, you know, you have a lot of [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1102.1000000000001s)]
*  places and I just left some of the richest places and we loved them and we they gave us [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1105.26s)]
*  a nice contribution of about five trillion dollars. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1110.42s)]
*  But this is a special place. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1113.38s)]
*  Even they talk about it. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1115.5400000000002s)]
*  So it's great to have everybody here under the. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1116.7s)]
*  And by the way, those are not some of the richest places either. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1119.98s)]
*  OK, Qatar's entire GDP is 200 billion dollars. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1123.9s)]
*  You know what the annual GDP of Canada is, who Donald Trump attacks, it's like three [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1128.46s)]
*  trillion dollars. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1133.34s)]
*  OK, do you know the GDP of California, which is the fourth largest in the world? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1134.7s)]
*  It's not that Qatar is rich. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1140.1s)]
*  And this is where Donald Trump's mind is so attached to this idea of like [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1141.98s)]
*  royal authoritarians versus democracies. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1150.18s)]
*  California has the fourth largest GDP in the entire world. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1153.94s)]
*  OK, it's not even close. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1158.42s)]
*  But Trump looks up to these leaders in the Middle East and they didn't commit five [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1160.78s)]
*  trillion dollars. They didn't commit 30 X their annual GDP to the United States. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1167.6599999999999s)]
*  And it's just absurd that nobody there is like, hey, you realize that that just makes [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1173.34s)]
*  absolutely no sense. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1177.1799999999998s)]
*  So then Donald Trump spoke to Putin today. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1178.58s)]
*  Now, I just want to give this context. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1180.6999999999998s)]
*  Trump was claiming that he was going to go to Istanbul to meet with Putin and [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1182.78s)]
*  Zelensky. Remember about two weeks ago, Putin said that he wanted to go to Istanbul [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1188.4599999999998s)]
*  and meet with Putin and have peace discussions, which we told you was all BS. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1193.3799999999999s)]
*  And it was going to be propaganda to try to play Donald Trump. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1197.06s)]
*  So Trump would attack Zelensky. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1199.8999999999999s)]
*  But the real goal was just Putin wanted to have a direct conversation with Donald Trump [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1202.1s)]
*  so that he can get everything he wanted out of Donald Trump and then try to force Ukraine [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1207.1399999999999s)]
*  to surrender because Zelensky has been making very smart diplomatic. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1212.1799999999998s)]
*  Zelensky showed up the Istanbul. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1215.82s)]
*  Putin backed out. Donald Trump backed out. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1217.82s)]
*  So then Donald Trump spoke to Putin today. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1220.3s)]
*  And the purpose of the call was tried to secure a ceasefire. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1223.26s)]
*  Instead, Donald Trump just made a post. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1226.6200000000001s)]
*  He's like, we talked about ceasefire. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1228.98s)]
*  I feel very good about these conversations. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1231.26s)]
*  Now it's up for Zelensky and Putin just to talk it out. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1234.34s)]
*  It's up to them to talk. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1239.18s)]
*  That's your solution. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1241.74s)]
*  Your solution is that you're done. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1243.46s)]
*  I just want to be clear. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1245.66s)]
*  You're done. Zelensky and Putin need to talk. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1247.18s)]
*  You don't think that's been thought about before. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1249.7s)]
*  And the problem is, is that Putin wants Zelensky to completely surrender [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1252.54s)]
*  and Zelensky wants Ukraine just to exist. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1257.74s)]
*  Right. If Ukraine stopped fighting, it would no longer exist. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1261.06s)]
*  If Russia stopped fighting, we would have peace. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1266.1s)]
*  Zelensky's agreed to an unconditional ceasefire. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1269.5s)]
*  That's the dynamic. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1272.22s)]
*  But what did our corporate news run with? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1273.62s)]
*  Donald Trump says ceasefire is going to work. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1275.82s)]
*  No. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1278.02s)]
*  Donald Trump claimed he was going to bring peace to Ukraine in 24 hours [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1278.7s)]
*  with taking office or even before that. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1282.78s)]
*  And what's Donald Trump speaking about? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1284.8999999999999s)]
*  Putin was clearly mocking Melania during the phone call. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1286.78s)]
*  And we know that also because Russian state regime media has been showing [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1291.34s)]
*  Melania nudes over and over again since the election. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1295.54s)]
*  Watch Donald Trump talk about, oh, I think Putin likes my wife. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1299.3799999999999s)]
*  I think he likes Melania. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1302.98s)]
*  That's what you got out of the call. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1304.7s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1306.4199999999998s)]
*  And compassionate first lady, I would say she is very dedicated. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1307.58s)]
*  In fact, if you look at just what I heard, Putin just said [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1312.34s)]
*  they respect your wife a lot. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1317.86s)]
*  I said, what about me? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1319.14s)]
*  No, they will. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1320.3799999999999s)]
*  They like they like Melania better. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1321.42s)]
*  That wasn't good. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1323.86s)]
*  I don't know if that was good. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1325.22s)]
*  I'm OK with it. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1326.26s)]
*  I'm OK. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1327.58s)]
*  I'm OK with it. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1330.02s)]
*  I'm OK. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1331.42s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1332.14s)]
*  When Putin said they respect your wife over there, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1333.5s)]
*  he was mocking you. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1336.62s)]
*  That's what he was doing. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1338.54s)]
*  I'm OK with it. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1341.02s)]
*  I mean, how weak and pathetic does he look? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1342.6999999999998s)]
*  Then you have Caroline Levitt [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1345.74s)]
*  give a press conference earlier in the day where she was asked [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1348.3s)]
*  if she has any updates about Stephen Miller, Trump's top advisors plan [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1351.9399999999998s)]
*  to suspend habeas corpus. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1357.06s)]
*  In other words, to dismantle the Constitution [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1359.54s)]
*  and take away people's right to have cases heard before federal courts [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1363.14s)]
*  by essentially invoking martial law. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1368.66s)]
*  And her response is we're still looking into that. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1371.5s)]
*  We're still looking into that. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1373.7s)]
*  Here, play this clip of one other question. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1374.7s)]
*  Recently, Stephen Miller at the White House made some comments about [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1376.94s)]
*  considering suspending habeas corpus. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1382.9s)]
*  And I'm curious if there's any update on how the White House is exploring [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1385.8200000000002s)]
*  that option to enact the president's agenda. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1389.54s)]
*  I don't have any update at this time, but I can check in with our deputy [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1392.42s)]
*  chief of staff, Mary Martin. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1395.38s)]
*  What in the Kim Jong Un are we watching right there? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1397.5800000000002s)]
*  The question what's going on with the potential elimination of our Constitution? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1400.5800000000002s)]
*  Well, I don't really have any updates on that, but I'm going to [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1405.3400000000001s)]
*  we're going to look into it. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1407.7s)]
*  We're going to do we understand the import of what they're saying? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1408.5800000000002s)]
*  By the way, this is what's going on on state regime media [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1412.18s)]
*  as they constantly show these Melania photos over and over again. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1414.9s)]
*  On Russian state TV media, I unfortunately we have to clarify which state. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1419.14s)]
*  What did I say? I said, just state regime media. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1424.1000000000001s)]
*  And so I just clarify, we're not talking about our state regime media, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1426.42s)]
*  the Russian state regime media and for the audio listeners. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1429.3000000000002s)]
*  I mean, they literally they run and they do this like all the time. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1432.66s)]
*  They show like nude pictures of Melania and they like Mocker. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1435.5400000000002s)]
*  It's it's it's insane. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1437.8600000000001s)]
*  And like, you know, this is all top down from Putin. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1439.42s)]
*  Like, this isn't just, you know, a random producer deciding to run this. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1442.0200000000002s)]
*  We've got a lot to discuss in this episode. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1446.6200000000001s)]
*  I want to talk more about what went down in that Caroline Leavitt press conference. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1448.82s)]
*  I want to talk about the status of the budget bill. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1453.3s)]
*  I want to talk about other pressing concerns. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1456.98s)]
*  Let's take our first quick break of the show. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1460.9399999999998s)]

*  We've got a lot of angry Joe Rogan fans who try to give negative one star reviews. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1475.7s)]
*  So if you think this if you think this show deserves a five star review, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1481.0600000000002s)]

*  We've got a lot more to discuss when we come back. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1520.66s)]
*  Have you heard about the crime that the FBI calls house stealing? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1526.26s)]
*  It's a growing real estate scam. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1529.9s)]
*  Targeting American homeowners and their equity. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1531.58s)]
*  And here's how it works. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1534.22s)]
*  Criminals forge your signature on one document. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1535.58s)]
*  Use a fake notary stamp, pay a small fee and file with your county. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1538.8999999999999s)]
*  Just like that, your home title has been transferred out of your name. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1542.6599999999999s)]
*  Then they take out loans using your equity or even sell your property. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1547.1s)]
*  And you won't even know it's happened until you start getting collections [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1552.02s)]
*  or foreclosure notices. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1556.1399999999999s)]
*  So let me ask you, when was the last time you checked your home title? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1558.02s)]
*  Now, if you're like me, the answer is never. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1562.54s)]
*  And that's exactly what scammers are counting on. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1565.6200000000001s)]
*  That's why you need to stop what you're doing right now and find out today. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1568.6200000000001s)]

*  Let's face it, after a night of drinks, I don't bounce back the next day like I used to. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1619.5400000000002s)]
*  Now, I thought I had to make a choice. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1623.78s)]
*  I can either have a great night or a great next day. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1625.42s)]
*  Now, that was until I found pre-alcohol. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1628.46s)]
*  Zbiotic's pre-alcohol probiotic drink is the world's first genetically engineered probiotic. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1631.3400000000001s)]
*  It was invented by Ph.D. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1636.94s)]
*  scientists to tackle rough mornings after drinking. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1638.38s)]
*  Now, here's how it works. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1641.1399999999999s)]
*  When you drink, alcohol gets converted into a toxic byproduct in the gut. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1642.1399999999999s)]
*  Now, it's a buildup of this byproduct, not dehydration. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1646.3s)]
*  That's the blame for rough days after drinking. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1649.6599999999999s)]
*  Pre-alcohol produces an enzyme to break this byproduct down. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1652.4199999999998s)]
*  Just remember to make pre-alcohol your first drink of the night, drink responsibly, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1656.34s)]
*  and you'll feel your best tomorrow. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1660.8999999999999s)]
*  Now, every time I have pre-alcohol before drinks, I notice a difference the next day. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1663.22s)]
*  Even after a night out, I can confidently plan on having a great next day without worrying. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1667.5s)]
*  Look, I won't lie, I was a bit on the fence about pre-alcohol initially. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1672.3s)]
*  But then while hanging out with some friends in D.C., I gave it a shot. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1676.02s)]
*  And believe me, it's the real deal. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1679.0600000000002s)]
*  So I first gave pre-alcohol a try when I was at a wedding. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1681.74s)]
*  I drank it before my first espresso martini. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1684.74s)]
*  And you wouldn't believe how on top of my game I felt the very next morning. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1687.02s)]
*  Spring is here, which means more opportunities to celebrate warmer weather. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1691.22s)]
*  And before drinks on the patio, that tropical vacation, or your best friend's wedding, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1695.58s)]

*  All right, let's get into it. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1758.02s)]
*  So Donald Trump's disastrous budget bill, which he calls a big, beautiful bill. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1759.2199999999998s)]
*  It's actually a massive, gigantic disaster. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1764.9399999999998s)]
*  By the way, don't you see the like New York Times and others like say, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1768.54s)]
*  the big, beautiful bill is making its way through. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1771.02s)]
*  Like, how do you literally buy that idiotic framework? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1773.02s)]
*  What this bill is going to do is it's going to add [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1776.4199999999998s)]
*  at least four trillion dollars to the deficit. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1779.94s)]
*  I think conservatively six trillion. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1783.9s)]
*  My prediction is more like 15 to 20 trillion when all is said and done, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1786.54s)]
*  especially when you factor in what Doge has done by essentially dismantling [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1791.22s)]
*  the IRS to allow rich people to avoid paying taxes [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1796.18s)]
*  by doing maneuvers that would otherwise be investigated. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1800.46s)]
*  So how do I know that this bill is going to add [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1803.9s)]
*  at least four trillion dollars to the deficit? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1807.9s)]
*  Remember how the MAGA Republicans were making it almost impossible [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1810.38s)]
*  for former President Biden to raise the debt ceiling? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1813.9s)]
*  Oh, that's so fiscally irresponsible. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1816.8600000000001s)]
*  How dare you do it? Really? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1818.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, in this budget bill, they raised the debt ceiling. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1820.5s)]
*  The MAGA Republicans do by at least four trillion dollars. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1824.3400000000001s)]
*  OK, that's in it right there. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1828.42s)]
*  When you take a look at then the trillions of dollars in tax cuts [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1830.26s)]
*  for the billionaires, you're looking at, you know, I think [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1833.7800000000002s)]
*  the best estimate is six trillion dollars. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1837.18s)]
*  I mean, it's literal. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1840.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, you can't even debate with that. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1841.02s)]
*  You want to have a debate with me, whether it's 15 or 20 trillion dollars. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1843.42s)]
*  That's going to be added to the deficit. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1847.54s)]
*  You know, fine. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1849.3s)]
*  But this also cuts Medicaid. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1850.42s)]
*  Eight hundred eighty billion dollars. That's still there. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1854.0600000000002s)]
*  There were some MAGA Republicans who were holdouts on the budget committee, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1857.02s)]
*  and they were not voting for this budget bill [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1861.0600000000002s)]
*  because they wanted more cuts to Medicaid. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1863.74s)]
*  They wanted to make sure more people were immediately taken off Medicaid. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1866.6200000000001s)]
*  And that wasn't delayed by a few years. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1870.74s)]
*  They wanted it to happen next year. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1873.06s)]
*  That was one of the things that MAGA Mike said, OK, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1875.42s)]
*  we'll get rid of these people from Medicaid right away. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1878.5s)]
*  If they don't meet the MAGA definition of able bodied, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1881.5s)]
*  MAGA will determine if you're able bodied or now MAGA will determine [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1886.34s)]
*  what your corporation should have to price. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1891.98s)]
*  You know, you see all of these press conference right now [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1895.14s)]
*  when a company like Wal-Mart, by the way, and I'm not trying to compliment Wal-Mart. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1897.46s)]
*  They've done a lot of crappy, crappy stuff, but and have destroyed small [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1901.54s)]
*  and medium sized businesses. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1905.06s)]
*  But when a company like Wal-Mart says, we're going to have to pass on costs [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1906.5s)]
*  to consumers and the Trump regime is like, no, you need to eat it. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1910.34s)]
*  You need to eat it. They did like the same stuff with Amazon. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1914.54s)]
*  They did the same stuff with like that. You need to eat the cost. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1917.78s)]
*  Sounds a little a little a little communisty. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1921.42s)]
*  If I. All of this stuff is Trump and MAGA central planning. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1924.1000000000001s)]
*  We're going to create MAGA savings accounts. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1929.74s)]
*  We're going to do them like they literally have something called MAGA [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1932.7s)]
*  savings accounts is one of their gimmicks. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1936.26s)]
*  So there's not going to be no tax on Social Security, but MAGA [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1939.02s)]
*  savings accounts, everybody. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1942.46s)]
*  I mean, is it this stuff if you're like, what do you mean MAGA savings? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1944.22s)]
*  Just I think I have a clip of Caroline Leavitt talking about the MAGA [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1947.14s)]
*  savings accounts here. Play this clip. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1950.7s)]
*  As I said, this is a very pro-family piece of legislation. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1952.42s)]
*  Not only does it increase the child tax credit, but it also includes [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1955.74s)]
*  MAGA baby savings accounts for children that are born before January 1st, 2024, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1960.1000000000001s)]
*  under eight years old, U.S. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1966.7s)]
*  citizens and have at least one parent with a valid social security number. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1968.46s)]
*  And when this tax provision becomes law, the child, if if the parents seek to do [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1973.5s)]
*  this will be set up with a savings account. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1979.34s)]
*  Essentially, it's a 401k for a newborn baby. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1981.98s)]
*  It's essentially a 401k for a newborn baby called a MAGA savings account. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1987.06s)]
*  I wonder which corporations are going to try to be benefiting from MAGA [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1992.3s)]
*  savings accounts and building out an entire industry around there. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=1996.9399999999998s)]
*  This is not a family friendly budget. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2002.98s)]
*  I mean, this is a budget that's going to kick you off of your health care. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2005.06s)]
*  I mean, the nonpartisan congressional [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2008.78s)]
*  budget groups that take a look at this have said that, you know, 13, 14 [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2013.54s)]
*  million Americans are going to lose their health care. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2018.54s)]
*  People are going to lose their supplemental nutrition assistance. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2021.34s)]
*  They're going to lose their their snap. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2025.1s)]
*  It guts HUD, which provides rental assistance and affordable housing to be. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2027.06s)]
*  It's by 40 percent. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2032.4199999999998s)]
*  This is the least family friendly thing. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2034.06s)]
*  And then they go out there and have Caroline Levitt just lie in the most [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2036.3s)]
*  brazen way imaginable. I mean, she's asked about the fact that this is going to add [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2040.86s)]
*  at least four trillion dollars to the deficit or more. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2046.1399999999999s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why Moody's downgraded America's credit score, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2049.02s)]
*  because this is going to blow up the deficit. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2053.1s)]
*  By the way, 25 to 30 percent of the deficit that's already existing [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2055.58s)]
*  was caused by Donald Trump the first time. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2059.94s)]
*  He was the most reckless with debt of any president in history. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2062.54s)]
*  And you don't have to take my word for it. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2067.4199999999996s)]
*  Go back and look at the GOP presidential debates, which Trump was too afraid [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2068.74s)]
*  to show up in. And you'll see DeSantis and Nikki Haley said the reason [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2072.06s)]
*  why we had inflation under Biden, a direct quote from them, was because [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2076.18s)]
*  of Donald Trump's reckless handling of the deficit and adding trillions [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2080.14s)]
*  and trillions of dollars in debt. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2083.8999999999996s)]
*  It's a direct quote from them. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2085.2599999999998s)]
*  So you don't have to quote me. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2086.8599999999997s)]
*  But here, Caroline Levitt just looks at the camera. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2088.1s)]
*  And I want you to watch her whole demeanor like she has, like the worst tells [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2090.66s)]
*  as she gears up to lie. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2095.02s)]
*  She does this thing like she flips her hair [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2096.9s)]
*  and she just kind of gears up and she like revels in the lie. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2100.38s)]
*  Like she's like, all right, I'm going to do a good lie. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2105.46s)]
*  Watch her get the question. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2108.58s)]
*  She like she like enjoys it. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2111.1s)]
*  You'll see her wind up. It's sick. It's sick. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2112.82s)]
*  Here, play this clip. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2115.82s)]
*  Just a quick follow up. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2117.02s)]
*  Is the president OK with this bill adding to the deficit? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2118.5s)]
*  This bill does not add to the deficit. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2122.9s)]
*  In fact, according to the Council of Economic Advisers, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2124.58s)]
*  this bill will save one point six trillion dollars. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2128.1s)]
*  And the president absolutely understands. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2132.42s)]
*  And here's the concerns of fiscal conservatives and of Americans [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2134.66s)]
*  who want to get our fiscal house in order. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2138.5s)]
*  That's what the intention of this bill is. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2140.18s)]
*  There's one point six trillion dollars worth of savings in this bill. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2142.3s)]
*  That's the largest savings for any legislation [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2145.18s)]

*  The next bill that even comes close was 800 billion dollars. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2152.14s)]
*  That's less than half of the savings that we see in the one big, beautiful bill. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2154.8599999999997s)]
*  And so the goal of this bill is to produce economic growth, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2158.7s)]
*  to cut taxes and to get our fiscal house in order. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2163.18s)]

*  China sees this opportunity. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2344.62s)]
*  While Donald Trump was out there begging for personal gifts to himself [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2347.38s)]
*  in the form of gold plated jets, which he claims, it's like the Statue of Liberty. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2351.7s)]
*  This is like a gift to America. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2356.58s)]
*  That's what they're going with now. It's like the Statue of Liberty. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2358.38s)]
*  The Statue of Liberty, there was a congressional resolution from 1877 [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2360.5s)]
*  agreeing to accept the gift of the Statue of Liberty. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2365.98s)]
*  The United States actually paid for some of its construction. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2369.54s)]
*  And that was for the American people, giving a gold plated jet [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2373.1000000000004s)]
*  that becomes part of Donald Trump's hypothetical library, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2376.5s)]
*  which isn't in existence, which means Trump gets to use this [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2379.7000000000003s)]
*  and his family uses it for their rich billionaire friends [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2382.82s)]
*  for the rest of their freaking lives on the American taxpayer dime. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2385.1000000000004s)]
*  OK, that that is not like the statue. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2390.46s)]
*  How offensive to say that it's offensive to your to our intelligence, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2392.54s)]
*  honestly, the whole thing like they always find the dumbest. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2397.02s)]

*  And there is nothing normal about this behavior. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2403.38s)]
*  And the fact that you have Donald Trump in any other media environment, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2406.26s)]
*  Trump threatening to hold military tribunals to imprison [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2410.2200000000003s)]

*  that might be like a big deal, right? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2419.38s)]
*  Trump ignoring calls, people begging [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2421.54s)]
*  in these states for help, help, please just help us a little bit. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2425.74s)]

*  And you can go on and on, you know, you could just talking about the tariffs [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2434.7s)]
*  and throwing the global economy into chaos, all that stuff, right? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2438.2999999999997s)]
*  You could talk about that for days. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2442.06s)]
*  But apparently the media wants the one they want. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2443.98s)]
*  They want to make sure, you know, that Joe Biden's old. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2446.3399999999997s)]

*  All that stuff could go to the side because folks, not sure if you've heard it. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2450.54s)]
*  Joe Biden, old guy. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2454.2599999999998s)]

*  And just think about how heinous it is to that during this [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2459.06s)]
*  really somber moment for our country to recognize [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2464.3399999999997s)]
*  that former President Biden got that diagnosis. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2468.7799999999997s)]
*  It took what less than 24 hours for Donald Trump to give a press conference [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2471.98s)]
*  and say the most despicable things about former President Biden [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2476.7s)]
*  and to go up there and basically spread conspiracies and to say, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2480.22s)]
*  oh, we should be looking into what's going on there. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2484.8999999999996s)]
*  And then he's then Donald Trump refers to [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2488.46s)]
*  that, you know, having a score of nine on the Gleason scale [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2492.4199999999996s)]

*  then pivoting to brag about passing dementia tests himself, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2504.66s)]
*  like making it about himself. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2510.14s)]
*  Oh, I passed. I aced it. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2512.02s)]
*  Trying to be like, I'm so smart. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2513.7s)]
*  I passed the dementia test. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2515.26s)]
*  But Biden has cancer. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2516.66s)]

*  I think it's very sad, actually. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2528.54s)]
*  I'm surprised that it wasn't, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2530.82s)]
*  you know, the public wasn't notified a long time ago [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2533.98s)]
*  because to get to stage nine, that's a long time. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2536.5s)]
*  I just had my physical. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2539.5800000000004s)]
*  You saw that you saw the results of that particular test. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2540.82s)]

*  pretty much anybody getting a physical, good physical. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2547.1000000000004s)]
*  We had the doctors at the White House and over at Walter Reed, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2550.86s)]
*  which is a fantastic hospital. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2554.38s)]

*  Your husband would be proud of me for getting them all right. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2564.82s)]
*  It's a little risk if I didn't get them all right. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2567.46s)]
*  These people would be after me. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2569.1000000000004s)]
*  It would be not a good situation. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=2570.26s)]

*  I just wanted to reflect on on that clip that you played right before break. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3056.2599999999998s)]
*  When you when you see President Biden speak about, you know, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3061.2999999999997s)]
*  just his legacy and what that means to him and how he sees [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3065.02s)]
*  in the direction of this country going and that he has hope. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3068.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, it really it really hits me at my core. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3070.54s)]
*  He genuinely believes it and it motivates me. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3073.02s)]
*  And I think it motivates us here at this network to make sure that we we make [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3075.54s)]
*  that, you know, a true reality here. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3079.34s)]
*  Beyond the politics of it all, like [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3082.14s)]
*  not that he's a Democrat or whatever, he's just a good person. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3084.7s)]
*  He's a good human being. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3089.06s)]
*  And for whatever reason, like legacy media, as you astutely pointed out, hates that. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3090.98s)]
*  They hate that steady hand on the wheel. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3096.06s)]
*  And for the life of me, it breaks my heart that that's the relationship [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3098.7s)]
*  that the media thinks that they need to be so antagonistic towards a true leader, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3102.58s)]
*  a true, truly great human being, like someone who actually cares about this country. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3107.02s)]
*  But even beyond that, like someone who just cares about other people. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3111.62s)]
*  You go to church every Sunday. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3114.54s)]
*  When my sorry, just quick, when my son was born, he wrote me a letter [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3116.74s)]
*  kind of congratulating me on the birth of my son. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3120.46s)]
*  I don't know if I've even really spoken about this publicly, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3123.1s)]
*  like went out of his way to write me a letter that he signed personally. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3125.62s)]
*  And it's just is someone that really cares. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3128.8199999999997s)]
*  He didn't have to do that. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3131.22s)]
*  I got to say this, Jordi, like other than the fact that he's just a good human being. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3132.46s)]
*  And to see the tappers of the world go so hard [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3137.14s)]
*  against someone who's just such a genuine person and write these smut books, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3141.38s)]
*  these smear books with secondhand anonymous sources. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3146.3s)]
*  Naomi Biden, she came out, Joe Biden's granddaughter came out, said she read the books [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3150.5s)]
*  and she said there's just anonymous sources just sprinkled throughout these books. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3154.42s)]
*  Well, hey, I'm a primary source. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3158.46s)]
*  I interviewed him here in Pittsburgh. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3160.58s)]
*  You know why he was here in Pittsburgh? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3162.18s)]
*  Because he was at the Steel Union, because he wanted to keep the jobs [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3163.66s)]
*  in the United States and met with the steelworkers here, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3166.02s)]
*  because he cared to keep the jobs here in America, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3168.4199999999996s)]
*  because he cared about the workers here in Pittsburgh and what they were doing. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3171.2999999999997s)]
*  Why? Because he's a good human, because he actually cares about this country. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3174.3399999999997s)]
*  Ben, you interviewed him. I was at the White House when you interviewed him. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3178.7799999999997s)]
*  It's a competent human being right there. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3181.22s)]
*  It's someone who truly understands what's needed in this moment. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3182.98s)]
*  And what is the media? [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3186.66s)]
*  How do they repay him for being just a genuine, authentic version of himself? [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3187.7799999999997s)]
*  And honestly, just just doing his best to lead this country and doing a damn good job of it. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3191.9s)]
*  They kill him. They stab him in the back. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3197.2999999999997s)]
*  They say, F you, Joe Biden, we don't want that. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3199.34s)]
*  But no, I'm not going to let that that weirdo narrative [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3201.1s)]
*  that this legacy media is trying to promote time and time again, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3204.5s)]
*  be the legacy that this man leaves behind, because what he's leaving behind [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3207.74s)]
*  is truly great and it's truly at its core patriotic. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3211.42s)]
*  And I just wanted to get that off my chest because I was reflecting on all these things [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3216.18s)]
*  as I continue to see this. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3219.14s)]
*  Sorry, Brett, go ahead. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3220.58s)]
*  No, well, I was going to say, like, you know, anytime I see like this, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3221.7s)]
*  you see that force of the media, right? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3225.38s)]
*  You see when the media machine kicks in, right? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3227.02s)]
*  You saw it after the debate, which we, of course, here, you know, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3228.7s)]
*  we're very honest about, very critical of, you know, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3231.14s)]
*  but but you saw the outsized media response after the fact [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3234.7s)]
*  and how they didn't stop punching, right? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3238.18s)]
*  They just did not stop. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3240.06s)]
*  And now you see they have this book release. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3241.5s)]
*  And so they're cranking it up, right? [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3243.46s)]
*  They're they're going nonstop about Biden. Right. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3245.02s)]
*  And I sometimes I just feel like I'm being constantly gaslighted [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3247.98s)]
*  by this machine out there because I think, too, like you said, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3251.22s)]
*  Jordi, your direct interactions that you had with the person. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3255.18s)]
*  And you know that there's a phrase that's something like, you know, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3258.58s)]
*  you may not remember every word somebody says, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3263.38s)]
*  but you remember how they make you feel. Right. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3265.42s)]
*  And every time we've been with, you know, President Biden, you know, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3267.7s)]
*  he has been incredibly present with us and he ingratious with his time [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3271.02s)]
*  and made us feel, you know, very welcome when we did that interview [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3276.94s)]
*  with President Biden. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3280.1400000000003s)]
*  He took much longer than we were actually scheduled for for the interview. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3281.78s)]
*  He then after the fact, you know, told the Secret Service to like [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3286.5s)]
*  push his meetings and stuff. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3290.02s)]
*  He showed us around the Oval Office. He told us stories. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3291.1800000000003s)]
*  It was very interesting, very unique, you know, very special kind of moment. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3294.78s)]
*  You know, and I even think back, Jordi, when you when you interviewed [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3298.9s)]
*  him in Pittsburgh and did a little social media with him in Pittsburgh, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3302.82s)]
*  you know, I recall what was one of the first things he said with the after [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3306.5800000000004s)]
*  after you finished recording, he said, how are your brothers doing? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3309.94s)]
*  You got their number. Could I give them a call? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3314.02s)]
*  And then you called me and Ben with the president of the United States [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3315.86s)]
*  on the phone. Ben was not near his phone. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3319.7400000000002s)]
*  I was teaching [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3322.7400000000002s)]
*  and missed the call. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3324.5800000000004s)]
*  But but I but I picked up. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3326.0600000000004s)]
*  And he was like as gracious and as nice as could be. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3327.6200000000003s)]
*  Oh, Brett, so good to hear from you. How's it going? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3330.34s)]
*  How's your family? How's your wife? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3332.78s)]
*  And so when I see the stories that are being presented and the way [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3335.82s)]
*  as if there was like some mass cover up, right, this is exactly [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3339.5s)]
*  there's some massive cover up that was going on. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3343.7000000000003s)]
*  If they were trying to cover anything up, they give us a little too much access [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3345.5s)]
*  because we would have fricking known, you know, we've known fast. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3349.1800000000003s)]
*  All right. We had one one on one conversation. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3352.9s)]
*  We would have known very quickly. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3354.94s)]
*  If they were trying to cover it up, they did a very bad job. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3356.78s)]
*  Well, where are you going to say then? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3359.82s)]
*  But just judge by the actions [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3361.78s)]
*  that we all objectively know took place. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3365.0600000000004s)]
*  I mean, want to talk about deals? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3369.5800000000004s)]
*  Want to talk about deals? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3373.34s)]
*  How about the fact that under President Biden, Finland [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3374.6200000000003s)]
*  and Sweden became members of NATO? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3379.0600000000004s)]
*  Right. It was the first time in a long while [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3382.82s)]
*  while for NATO to expand the way it did. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3387.5800000000004s)]
*  Think about a deal like that with countries so close [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3391.82s)]
*  to Russia and strengthening the NATO alliance. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3396.82s)]
*  I mean, 16.2 million jobs created. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3399.38s)]

*  I want to just pivot quickly to some of these international elections [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3795.74s)]
*  because I think it's important. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3798.54s)]
*  We reported on the Canadian elections right where their MAGA [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3799.74s)]
*  Maple led by the Conservative Party, Pierre Poliev, was leading in all of the polls. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3803.3399999999997s)]
*  Then they got demolished by the Liberal Party. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3808.3799999999997s)]
*  Prime Minister Mark Carney was able to form a minority government right there. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3810.7799999999997s)]
*  And a massive upset in Pierre Poliev lost his seat there. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3814.66s)]
*  You go to Australia where their Liberal Party, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3817.8599999999997s)]
*  which is actually their Conservative Party, their Labour Party in Australia, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3820.1s)]
*  is their Liberal Party, the right wing party, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3823.54s)]
*  which was led by a guy named Peter Dutton, who they called Tmoo MAGA [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3826.7799999999997s)]
*  or Tmoo Trump. He lost his seat and they got demolished. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3830.74s)]
*  So the center, center left party in Canada won the center, [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3834.62s)]
*  center left party in Australia won. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3838.2999999999997s)]
*  And the polls just like completely switched and reversed. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3840.2999999999997s)]
*  We saw the same thing happen in Romania, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3844.54s)]
*  where their far right wing party led by this guy named George Simeon, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3847.18s)]
*  he noddled himself. He says he's the Romanian MAGA guy. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3853.86s)]
*  He actually won the first round in the elections earlier in the month. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3859.02s)]
*  But Romania rallied around the centrist, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3863.26s)]
*  center left pro-EU, pro-democracy candidate. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3867.62s)]
*  Young people basically said, we can't have our country become like Hungary [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3870.58s)]
*  or become like Argentina or frankly become like America. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3876.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, right now we're just going to be a Putin proxy. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3879.5s)]
*  We can't let that happen. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3882.46s)]
*  And a big victory there from this guy named Nickasher Dan, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3884.1s)]
*  who is their pro-center, their center left campaign, pro-EU candidate right there. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3889.2599999999998s)]
*  And that was a big victory there. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3897.38s)]
*  And then in Poland, you had in Poland, the mayor of Warsaw, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3899.94s)]
*  liberal centrist guy ended up beating the far right wing, Karol Naroki, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3905.2200000000003s)]
*  in the first round. There's going to be a second round June 1st. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3910.26s)]
*  The president of Poland right now is a right wing guy. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3914.1400000000003s)]
*  The prime minister is more of a center liberal guy. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3918.1s)]
*  They have somewhat of a confusing system in their part, not that confusing, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3922.82s)]
*  but in their parliamentary system, the prime minister is the head of government [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3926.6200000000003s)]
*  and they have a president who's the head of state. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3929.98s)]
*  The prime minister has more power, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3932.02s)]
*  but the president still has veto rights. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3933.54s)]
*  And so in Poland, you have the center, center left candidate win the first round there. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3935.46s)]
*  So we're seeing this Trump effect across the world. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3940.7s)]
*  And so, you know, either you have countries bribing, you know, Trump at this point, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3944.66s)]
*  you know, or just totally repelling and checking him and forming alliances [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3949.9s)]
*  that basically isolate the United States as there's this massive flight away [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3957.3s)]
*  from American markets as the American brand has been irreparably harmed by Trump [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3962.66s)]
*  and, you know, and MAGA. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3969.1s)]
*  So I think that gives us a full scope of all of the events taking place right now. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3971.7s)]
*  I'm going to go and spend the rest of the birthday with my family. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCcbT-sC-9Y&t=3976.7s)]
