# Trump PANICS in Morning after TERRIBLE NEWS
**MeidasTouch:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo)
*  A very frantic Donald Trump is trying to post his way out of the disaster he has created for his regime. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=0.0s)]
*  As his plans continue to backfire, he was posting last night around midnight attacks against MSNBC, calling it MSDNC. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=9.6s)]
*  Today he was posting attacks on former President Biden. He was making random posts, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=20.64s)]
*  make America great again with exclamation points. He was lying and saying, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=26.479999999999997s)]
*  inflation is down, I've solved the problem, make America great again, everybody is happy, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=31.36s)]
*  there's jobs for everyone, people are living their best lives. Now, literally as the data comes in [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=36.96s)]
*  that prices are higher, like try to get a cup of coffee, I mean it's projected to be like 59% higher [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=43.44s)]
*  as a result of Donald Trump's tariffs in some places. Take a look at housing right now, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=51.12s)]
*  mortgage rates crossing what 7% could even potentially hit 8% soon. And of course, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=56.4s)]
*  most bankers right now and most economists believe we're either already in a recession, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=64.24s)]
*  we're heading for a recession. The question is, what's the contraction of the economy going to be? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=69.36s)]
*  Negative 3%, negative 2%, is the contraction going to hit in a quarter later? What's going to happen [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=74.88s)]
*  there? But Donald Trump just keeps on posting over and over again. And by the way, the White [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=81.92s)]
*  House posted this image, as one individual noted, I can't believe this is real, but it is. It's a [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  photo of miners with their faces covered after a hard day's work of labor. And this is the type [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=94.16s)]
*  of jobs that Donald Trump is saying he wants to see more jobs like this. And look, a big shout out [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=104.48s)]
*  to miners. Let me be very, very clear, hardworking Americans who deserve to be treated with absolute [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=111.12s)]
*  respect. They deserve to be paid more, frankly. But let's talk about higher paying jobs for people [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=118.08s)]
*  like this. We know that factories are closing right now. We should be giving our American workers [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=124.4s)]
*  the absolute best. It's just an odd image of the Trump regime to continue posting images of like [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=131.28s)]
*  coal workers as the pinnacle of what they want to see the American economy look like as the American [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=138.8s)]
*  economy was evolving to have higher paying jobs under former President Biden to bring everybody [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=147.2s)]
*  up. As former President Biden said, a job is about dignity, yet Donald Trump and Elon must continue to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=153.04s)]
*  attack that. Also, when you're going through Donald Trump's posts on his social media platform, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=160.4s)]
*  this is a real ad. As you're scrolling through Donald Trump's posts, it's Matt Gaetz with an [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=166.8s)]
*  Ivermectin tablet. I'm not trying to say if they think he looks like a horse or what the point. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=174.08s)]
*  They didn't want you to have Ivermectin, but you can still get it here. That's what they're promoting [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=179.76s)]
*  on Trump's social media platform, which last year lost close to $400 million and only earned like [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=186.56s)]
*  what, $3.5 million in revenue. Yeah. So your local boba restaurant or Starbucks restaurant or Starbucks [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=194.32s)]
*  or local restaurant makes more money, earns more revenue and certainly more profit than Trump media [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=202.56s)]
*  does. Then Trump randomly posts, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik is great. She's so great. This is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=209.76s)]
*  the attack on former President Biden. Sleepy Joe Biden, the worst president in the history of the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=215.84s)]
*  United States, has allowed millions and millions of criminals, many of them murderers, drug dealers, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=220.8s)]
*  and people released from prisons and mental institutions. Wow, wow, wow. Hannibal Lecter, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=224.96s)]
*  this blah, blah, blah. You know, if you want to look at the deportation numbers, former President [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=228.96s)]
*  Biden this time last year, this month, deported more people than Donald Trump and more people [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=234.8s)]
*  actually that had criminal records with Donald Trump. So you may be saying that's odd. Donald [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=241.2s)]
*  Trump says the opposite. Well, Donald Trump lies about everything and you may go, well, that's odd. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  I didn't really hear former President Biden talk about it that much yet because they went through [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  the process. They had competent people. They had immigration judges who went about a process. And [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=255.2s)]
*  then there were deportations that were handled pursuant to due process and pursuant to the law. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=261.52s)]
*  And it just happened. Donald Trump wants to torture people. He wants to do it fascist [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=267.2s)]
*  apprentice style, right? As I've said, this regime, in addition to being the rug pull Ponzi [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=272.64s)]
*  scheme regime, it's like a weird version of the apprentice meets Kim Jong-un. That's what these [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=277.36s)]
*  cabinet meetings look like. Everything's a show, but they're not actually competent in the underlying [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=282.48s)]
*  execution of what their plans are. Remember, Donald Trump said there were going to be millions [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=288.08s)]
*  of people deported on day one. Well, that's not what happened. But what he did do is he picked [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=292.8s)]
*  90% like innocent people without criminal records at all. No criminal records here, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=298.56s)]
*  no criminal records in their home country. And then he sent them to concentration camps in El [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=304.32s)]
*  Salvador so he could feel like a tough guy. And then when the Supreme Court says, what the hell [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  are you doing? Nine to zero return to Brego Garcia. What? Why are you doing this? Oh, that's not what [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=314.0s)]
*  they said. I won. And we can't do anything. The leader of El Salvador says there's nothing we can [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=319.6s)]
*  do. This is a terrorist MS-13 member. Well, Donald, your immigration judge in 2019 created [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=324.88s)]
*  the protected status for a Brego Garcia. 2019. I know you have all these cognitive issues now [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=331.68s)]
*  for a long time, but you were in office in 2019. Oh, then Donald Trump makes this post. You see, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=338.16s)]
*  it's frantic this morning. Post, post, post, post, post, post, post, post, starting last night around [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=344.32000000000005s)]
*  midnight. He goes, everyone knows that Harvard has lost its way. They hired from New York, Bill D, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=348.32s)]
*  and Chicago, L'Oreal, ridiculously high salaries, two of the worst and most, and he puts this again, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=356.0s)]
*  incompetent people, radical left fools, inept women. I mean, he's go, go and read. I'm not going to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=362.48s)]
*  read the whole freaking thing because it's like, like written by a psycho. Like it's written by a [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=367.76s)]
*  mad man, like a lunatic, a deranged, demented person. Imagine if somebody who you worked with, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=373.12s)]
*  someone you knew in your life, somebody who was part of a social club, wrote like that and sent [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=379.6s)]
*  you messages. You'd be like, yo, this person is a little bit, you know, not a little bit. I mean, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=384.8s)]
*  and this person is dangerous right here. Have you heard about the crime that the FBI calls [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=391.12s)]
*  house stealing? It's a growing real estate scam targeting American homeowners and their equity. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=396.56s)]
*  And here's how it works. Criminals forge your signature on one document. Use a fake notary [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=401.92s)]
*  stamp, pay a small fee and file with your county. Just like that, your home title has been transferred [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=407.68s)]
*  out of your name. Then they take out loans using your equity or even sell your property. And you [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=413.6s)]
*  won't even know it's happened until you start getting collections or foreclosure notices. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=420.32s)]
*  So let me ask you, when was the last time you checked your home title? Now, if you're like me, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=425.68s)]
*  the answer is never. And that's exactly what scammers are counting on. That's why you need [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=431.44s)]

*  morning, attacking America's leading educational institutions, lying about the economy and saying [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=489.92s)]
*  things are great. You know, Donald, people can look at their 401ks and their pensions. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=498.48s)]
*  People who are living paycheck to paycheck know it's not going great right now. You know that [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=503.44s)]
*  people who are losing their jobs in states like Ohio as factories are they know you've lied to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=509.2s)]
*  them. And so you could keep the Ponzi scheme rug pull going. But people are aware of like, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=516.96s)]
*  what is happening? And I understand that you've got state regime media known as Fox and you've [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=524.08s)]
*  got corporate news to do your bidding, but we've got the Midas Touch network right now. Okay. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=529.2s)]
*  We get more viewers than all of them. And by the way, everybody go to mitisplus.com. That's our [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=534.4s)]
*  sub stack. Sign up because we're trying to get to a million subscribers on that sub stack. It's now [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=539.28s)]
*  the fastest growing sub stack in the world. Take a look at this right here. They're all, all of the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=543.52s)]
*  people in Trump's or a lot of the people, I shouldn't say a lot of the people in Trump's [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=549.36s)]
*  cabinet and Trump's senior staff are dyeing their hair the way Trump does. They also wear these [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=554.0s)]
*  Trump pins with Trump's face on it. You take a look right here. This is Dr. Oz. As we said on [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=560.4s)]
*  the Midas Touch account, the Trump hair dye job is deeply, deeply disturbing. And just in case you [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=568.3199999999999s)]
*  were confused, just to go back to the last slide I showed you about why he's attacking Harvard, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=574.9599999999999s)]
*  because Harvard said, no, we're not going to become a vassal institution of the Trump regime. No, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=580.0s)]
*  we're not going to let the Trump regime take over our admissions process and force us to get rid of [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=585.04s)]
*  any form of diversity at Harvard. No, we're not going to let you tell us who we can hire. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=591.92s)]
*  The Trump regime wanted to, this is true, they wanted to audit the political views of the faculty [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  and the students at Harvard. And they wanted to look and have everybody's political views laid out. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=604.16s)]
*  Really? That seems like the most communist central planning fascist authoritarian thing in the world. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=609.76s)]
*  By the way, this morning, the Wall Street Journal did this incredible expose on Elon. So right, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=614.96s)]
*  the Republicans were the party of family values. Also, we pledge allegiance to Elon Musk. This is [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=621.12s)]
*  from the Wall Street Journal, folks. Rupert Murdoch's paper, the Wall Street Journal. Here's what it [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=628.88s)]
*  says. The tactics Elon Musk uses to manage his legion of babies and their mothers. So this was [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=634.6400000000001s)]
*  Ashley St. Claire on the cover. That's her with her baby Romulus, I think is the baby's name. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=642.64s)]
*  And Elon Musk offered her apparently $15 million and $100,000 a month in support in exchange for [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  her silence about the child who they named Romulus after a historical figure who murdered his brother. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=656.64s)]
*  Similar agreements had been negotiated with other mothers of Musk's children because Elon Musk wanted [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=663.68s)]
*  to reach legion level status before the apocalypse. So Elon wanted to have a camp where all of his [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=670.16s)]
*  mothers and his legions, he calls them his legions, the babies. And he finds the woman on Twitter, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=679.12s)]
*  according to this article, and then has the legions live in a compound. And then there was [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=684.88s)]
*  another story in the Wall Street Journal about a crypto reporter named Tiffany Fong, who was [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=691.76s)]
*  approached by Musk and asked if he can, if she could have his baby and she could have a legion. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=697.28s)]
*  Family values. These are the people who are engaged in a hostile takeover of our country, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=704.64s)]
*  who are defaming our veterans, who are lying and saying these people have been fired for cause for [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=710.4s)]
*  not doing a good job. They're stripping away their dignity. And then these creeps are going on Twitter [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=715.92s)]
*  and using their accounts to try to impregnate women and create legions with their oligarchical [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=722.0s)]
*  money. These are real sickos. These are real freaking sickos, folks. Moving on, the governor [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=727.76s)]
*  of California, Governor Newsom, just filed a bombshell lawsuit against the Trump regime for [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=735.28s)]
*  the Trump regime's tariffs. This is similar to these other lawsuits that's just based on, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=741.2s)]
*  but it's being brought by the governor of California, California, now Newsom versus Trump. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=746.8s)]
*  And this lawsuit relates to Trump doesn't have the power to unilaterally impose tariffs, as Trump's [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  asserting war authority powers to tariff the world. The power to tariff is in Congress. You have to [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=757.5999999999999s)]
*  pass laws on these things. But Trump is saying, I'm a wartime president. We're at war against [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=765.28s)]
*  Venezuela. We're at war. This is Trump says. He's declaring a national emergency because of war [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=770.56s)]
*  with all of these countries, so with Canada, with Australia, with Europe, with our allies. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=778.0s)]
*  So that's why Trump says that he has the ability to go around Congress, even though if you look at [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=784.8s)]
*  Australia, there's a surplus with Australia. I mean, none of this makes sense at all other than [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=791.44s)]
*  Trump is deranged, dangerous. He wants to break all of the institutions, break America's prominence [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=798.32s)]
*  as the leader of the world economy, and he wants to suck up to Putin. You can see headlines like [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=804.72s)]
*  this as well. U.S. vehicle supply is falling amid tariff fear. So what's the Trump regime talking [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=811.12s)]
*  about? What's their central message today? Ding, ding, ding. You guessed it. They're talking about [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=816.8000000000001s)]

*  Justice that because Maine has two transgender athletes, they're suing Maine. They tried to get [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=828.32s)]
*  rid of all of the funding for Maine's public schools because Maine said, look, we're following [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=834.08s)]
*  the law. Stop bullying the two transgender people who are in Maine. There's two. Stop bullying them. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=838.8000000000001s)]
*  And then the Trump regime tried to get rid of all federal funding to public schools. So like 172,000 [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=847.44s)]
*  kids who would get their lunches in the state of Maine would get that taken away because Trump [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=853.0400000000001s)]
*  wants to bully two transgender kids in the state of Maine. So the state of Maine got the initial [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=858.0s)]
*  attempt by the Trump regime to steal all of the funding away, blocked. So there's an injunction [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=866.0s)]
*  there. So today the DOJ coming with force and suing the state of Maine. Here's Pam Bondi talking [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=870.96s)]
*  about it this morning in her press conference. Let's play it. I haven't heard Janet Mills comment. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=876.8s)]
*  Governor Mills said it's only a couple trans athletes. Well, I think those are [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=882.0s)]
*  boys who identify as girls wanting to beat girls in girls sports. Well, if one young woman is in [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=886.64s)]
*  jeopardy, one, that's enough for us to be standing up here. One, no boy will be undressing in a girl's [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=893.92s)]
*  locker room. No boy will be walking in a woman's restroom. And no boy, when we're finished with [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=900.96s)]
*  this, will be beating young girls in sports. These young women have, many of them have trained, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=907.6s)]
*  what since you were in elementary school for your sport. Riley, when did you start swimming? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=913.84s)]
*  Four years old. They have trained their entire lives. Some of them have lost scholarships. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=918.88s)]
*  They have lost regionals. They have lost state because of boys. I don't care if it's one, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=924.96s)]
*  I don't care if it's two, I don't care if it's a hundred. It's going to stop and it's going to [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU60mb0ICxo&t=929.76s)]
