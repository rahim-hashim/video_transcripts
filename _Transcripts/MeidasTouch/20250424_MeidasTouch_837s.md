# Gov. Newsom DESTROYS Trump for ECONOMIC DISASTER
**MeidasTouch:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc)
*  I'm joined by California Governor Gavin Newsom. Governor, when you and I last spoke, it was the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=0.0s)]
*  day after Donald Trump announced his tariffs against the world. You warned everyone how dangerous and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=5.84s)]
*  harmful it was going to be. Three weeks later, what's your reaction? Well, I mean 10x worse than [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=12.96s)]
*  we even feared, and we were pretty sober when we got together the day after quote-unquote [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=19.2s)]
*  liberation day. But we've seen what's happened to the world economy. The coin of the realm is [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=24.8s)]
*  trust and how we have eroded trust around the globe, how this is going to take, I think, years [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=30.0s)]
*  and years and years to unwind despite what Donald Trump believes and how the markets are behaving as [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  they zig and zag. And as you know, since then, California, the largest state in our union size [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=43.04s)]
*  of 21 state populations combined, now the fourth largest economy in the world based on IMF figures [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  that just came out, international monetary fund figures yesterday. No state has been more impacted [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=55.68s)]
*  by the tariffs economically. And as a consequence, we're the first state to sue the Trump administration [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=61.28s)]
*  and we're damn confident that we're going to win that lawsuit. Tell us about that lawsuit, Governor. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=66.56s)]
*  How important is it? Well, it's critical. I mean, he has no unilateral authority to impose these [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=71.68s)]
*  tariffs. And interestingly, the Koch brothers backed a lawsuit saying exactly the same thing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  So look at the ideological prism here, a big blue state and progressive governor and some of the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=84.16s)]
*  most conservative, quote unquote, leaders in this country representing the same point of view. And [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  you may have seen just in the last 24 hours, 12 states attorney generals just joined and are also [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=97.12s)]
*  suing the Trump administration, making exactly the same claim. And it's interesting. Final point on [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=103.6s)]
*  that the Trump administration is trying to change the jurisdiction for our case and our suit, which [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=108.8s)]
*  is just another example of how concerned I think they are. And again, any legal scholar looks at [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=114.96s)]
*  this. It seems pretty black and white. He simply cannot assert the authority he has under this 1977 [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=120.0s)]
*  construct to unilaterally advance tariffs. So we think we are in a very good and solid position. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=129.6s)]
*  Since that day that Donald Trump calls Liberation Day, which I think we call devastation or liquidation [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=136.96s)]
*  day, Donald Trump's been sending messages of tariffs on, tariffs off, tariffs on, tariffs off. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  Then there are these like private meetings that are taking place where things are like leaked out [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=148.96s)]
*  and that the markets become very volatile. What message is Donald Trump sending to the business [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  community, which is the volatility he's creating? Well, he's open for business. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=160.16s)]
*  I mean, free enterprise to crony capitalism overnight. I mean, every single one of those [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=165.84s)]
*  meetings represents sort of a side deal, a special interest of sorts. Some may be nations, others [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=171.28s)]
*  may be companies the size of nations that make political contributions. We saw this in Trump 1.0. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=178.16s)]
*  There was an independent analysis done as it relates to the relatively modest tariffs that he [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  imposed in his first term and how he decided to pull some of those tariffs back and now they were [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=189.6s)]
*  directly connected to contributors. I mean, this is serious stuff. It's happening in just plain [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=196.0s)]
*  sight and he wants everyone to kneel and everyone to reach out directly to him. This is democracy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=201.68s)]
*  This is Donald Trump's version of it. So it's a very serious moment and that's why there's a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=211.44s)]
*  series of purpose and grateful with these attorney generals in these 12 other states and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=217.68s)]
*  I think everybody not just crying foul, but getting a little bit more strategic. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=222.16s)]
*  And I appreciate, you know, we're seeing this party's buzzing now. It's come alive at the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  grassroots. People are showing up, stepping up. They're not giving into the cynicism and fear. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=232.4s)]
*  There was some resignation, I would argue, for a while. It felt that way in some corners right [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=236.72s)]
*  after the election. That's no longer the case and it's really wonderful to see that energy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=242.32s)]
*  You see in the AOC rallies and Bernie rallies, which is just incredible, but also just the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=247.36s)]
*  enthusiasm that I always feel when we see a guy like Cory Booker stand up for 25 hours or what [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=253.68s)]
*  Chris did down in El Salvador. It's just great to see people being accountable at this moment and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=260.0s)]
*  I think states like California have a responsibility. We're now about to present our 16th lawsuit [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  against the Trump administration. We need to really start to assert ourselves from a position of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  strength. You visited China in October of 2023. You met with Xi Jinping and other leadership in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=275.84s)]
*  China. So you know how they negotiate, how they respond to threats. Now Trump imposed a 145% [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=282.88s)]
*  tariff on China. Then China retaliated in kind. They cut rare earth minerals. Trump's been claiming [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=291.28s)]
*  that he's been talking with China, but China's foreign minister today said that's fake news. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=298.4s)]
*  There's no discussions taking place until and unless Trump wants to remove the unilateral [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=304.16s)]
*  tariffs. What do you make governor of Trump's negotiations with China? Well, I saw a meme of [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=309.36s)]
*  Xi reading the art of the deal laughing. I think it summed everything up. That was on my feed [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=315.76000000000005s)]
*  yesterday. I mean, here's Trump negotiating against himself. I want to be careful here [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=322.0s)]
*  because I love my country. I love this nation, but it's just interesting the approach that she [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=330.56s)]
*  has taken, which seems a little bit more steady handed as it relates to his approach on retaliatory [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=337.12s)]
*  tariffs. Now the impacts of that are outsized in my state. I've got the port of Long Beach. 40% [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  of goods moving in this country, in LA and Long Beach, come through and they're starting to dry [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=349.2s)]
*  up. That's not a gross exaggeration. It's modest one drying up, but they're starting to significantly [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=353.2s)]
*  decline in terms of amount of cargo coming in to the states. One of the principal reasons we felt [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=358.48s)]
*  we had standing in a lawsuit. This is the number one manufacturing state in America. It's the number [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=363.6s)]
*  one state in terms of direct foreign investment, two-way trade. We dominated every category, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=368.8s)]
*  economic category. There are no peers, an ag and forestry jobs across the spectrum. This state [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=375.12s)]
*  is disproportionately impacted. I pray that we can get a deal with China because of its outsize [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=382.32s)]
*  influence. I'll just argue one simple point. As a guy with four young kids, 80% of those toys [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=391.84s)]
*  that are supposed to be coming in the ports right now for the holidays, they come from China. This [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  impact is to me, it's personal. Yeah, it's a professional responsibility as a fiduciary [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=404.32s)]
*  for the state. I'm a small business person myself and business is directly impacted. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=411.04s)]
*  So it's not an intellectual exercise. This one is absorbed in every corner of our society, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=415.92s)]
*  Democrat, Republican, rural, urban. These impacts are extraordinary. And what he's done is [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=423.12s)]
*  extraordinary. And we have to be extraordinarily vigilant and forceful in our response. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  Governor, California just passed Japan as the fourth largest economy in the world, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  which of course sounds like a big deal. You posted about it. Why is this just an important [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=441.92s)]
*  thing for us to all recognize more broadly, geopolitically? Well, it's a point of pride. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=448.88s)]
*  I mean, it's a big blue state with $4.1 trillion a year economic output where 14% of the GDP in [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=455.2s)]
*  the United States of America, 50% more than the next big state. But I also want people to understand [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=461.28s)]
*  that this is a donor state. In 2023, Californians contributed $83.1 billion more than we received [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  from the federal government. And by the way, for your viewers, they may be interested in this. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  That state, Texas, took $71.1 billion more than they provided the federal government. California, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=479.84s)]
*  $83 billion contributor, taker, Texas. And I say that to make a broader point. 71% [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=488.08s)]
*  of the economic output in the United States of America, blue counties, blue metros, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=495.76s)]
*  blue states with lower deaths of despair rates, higher wages, more productivity, greater growth, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=500.8s)]
*  lower death rates as it relates to murder. It is a mythology that somehow red states are dominating [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=508.47999999999996s)]
*  and blue states are struggling. It's factually untrue. And I think today as it relates to the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=516.72s)]
*  illumination from the International Monetary Fund that did the analysis that we highlighted, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  it's just a proof point of states like California, big blue states all across this country that [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=527.36s)]
*  continue to be the tentpole of the US economy. You know, Governor, Texas seems to take the Trump [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=532.88s)]
*  approach at the government level, attack the citizens, take away freedoms, ban the books, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=538.24s)]
*  cut social programs, but California has done the opposite. California has grown because it has [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=543.68s)]
*  invested in good social programs. So you show that that actually leads to growth. Why is investing [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  in good social programs, good for business and the economy? Well, we had a formula for success. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=556.0799999999999s)]
*  We have the conveyor belt for talent that's second to none, and that's being vandalized [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=562.2399999999999s)]
*  all across this country. It's our university system. The UCs, the CSUs, our community college [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=566.0s)]
*  system, the backbone of our workforce development that conveys more talent than any other system [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=571.2s)]
*  in the United States. And again, we're seeing that attacked for ideological reasons all across this [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=577.76s)]
*  country. Good for Harvard for standing firm and standing tall. And that's a call to arms for all [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=582.5600000000001s)]
*  universities to follow suit and do the same. We invest in research and development. 18% of the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=587.84s)]
*  world's research and development, number three on the planet, China, Germany, and California, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=594.24s)]
*  the biggest investment in research and development, pushing out the boundaries of discovery, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=599.92s)]
*  more scientists, engineers, researchers, more Nobel laureates, more venture capital coming from [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=604.24s)]
*  California and the United States and the nation, that innovation, the entrepreneurialism. The [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=609.1999999999999s)]
*  reason we call this a coast of California is the coast of dreams because we're a dream maker for [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=613.04s)]
*  people all around the globe that want to come here for riches and new beginnings. 27% of this [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=619.28s)]
*  state is foreign born, majority minority state living and advancing together across every [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=624.48s)]
*  imaginable difference. That's what makes us great. We celebrate our interesting differences, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=629.28s)]
*  as Clinton said, but we also unite around the things that bind us together. And it's a point [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=633.68s)]
*  of pride. All of that under assault, under attack, human capital, economic impacts of these tariffs, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=637.52s)]
*  human capital being assaulted with these immigration raids and the chill as it relates to [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=645.12s)]
*  legal immigration, not just issues related to the border. And so all of these things, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=649.92s)]
*  these are precious things, but all these things are foundationally part of that formula for [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=656.8s)]
*  success that I think blue states understand at their core. You invest in people, you invest [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=661.12s)]
*  in opportunity, you invest in growth, and you create conditions where people feel included, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=666.5600000000001s)]
*  they feel seen, they feel heard, and they come out and they take risks. And as a consequence, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=671.6800000000001s)]
*  we're all rewarded for that. And so that's why I'm proud. I've come from a state, there's the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=676.48s)]

*  important thing is we have to maintain our vigilance. We have to step up and step in. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=753.92s)]
*  We have agency. We can shape the future. The future is not something to experience. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maf_KVcIbzc&t=759.52s)]
